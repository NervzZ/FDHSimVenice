      "content": "\nContextualization Report for Historical Simulation: Venice, October 3, 1786 (Nexus Goethe-Volkmann-Goldoni)\n\n\n1. Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

      "content": "Oct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n",

      "content": "FROM VERONA TO VENICE.\nVerona, Sept. 16th.\nWell then, the amphitheatre is the first important monument of the old times that I have seen—and how well it is preserved! When I entered, and still more when I walked round the edge of it at the top, it seemed strange to me, that I saw something great, and yet, properly speaking, saw nothing. Besides I do not like to see it empty, I should like to see it full of people, just as, in modern times, it was filled up in honour of Joseph I. and Pius VI. The Emperor, although his eye was accustomed to human masses, must have been astonished. But it was only in the earliest times, that it produced its full effect, when the people was more a people than it is now. For, properly speaking, such an amphitheatre is constructed to give the people an imposing view of itself,—to cajole itself.\nWhen anything worth seeing occurs on the level ground, and any one runs to the spot, the hindermost try by every means to raise themselves above the foremost; they get upon benches, roll casks, bring up vehicles, lay planks in every direction, occupy the neighbouring heights, and a crater is formed in no time.\nIf the spectacle occur frequently on the same spot, light scaffoldings are built for those who are able to pay, and the rest of the multitude must get on as it can. Here the problem of the architect is to satisfy this general want. By means of his art he prepares such a crater, making it as simple as possible, that the people itself may constitute the decoration. When the populace saw itself so assembled, it must have been astonished at the sight, for whereas it was only accustomed to see itself running about in confusion, or to find itself crowded together without particular rule or order, so must this many-headed, many-minded, wandering animal now see itself combined into a noble body, made into a definite unity, bound and secured into a mass, and animated as one form by one mind. The simplicity of the oval is most pleasingly obvious to every eye, and every head serves as a measure to show the vastness of the whole. Now we see it empty, we have no standard, and do not know whether it is large or small.\nThe Veronese deserve commendation for the high preservation in which this edifice is kept. It is built of a reddish marble, which has been affected by the atmosphere, and hence the steps which have been eaten, are continually restored, and look almost all new. An inscription makes mention of one Hieronymus Maurigenus, and of the incredible industry, which he has expended on this monument. Of the outer wall only a piece remains, and I doubt whether it was ever quite finished. The lower arches, which adjoin the large square, called \"Il Bra,\" are let out to workmen, and the reanimation of these arcades produces a cheerful appearance.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe most beautiful gate, which, however, always remains closed, is called \"Porta stupa,\" or \"del Pallio.\" As a gate, and considering the great distance from which it is first seen, it is not well conceived, and it is not till we come near it, that we recognise the beauty of the structure.\nAll sorts of reasons are given to account for its being closed. I have, however, a conjecture of my own. It was manifestly the intention of the artist to cause a new Corso to be laid out from this gate, for the situation, or the present street, is completely wrong. On the left side there is nothing but barracks; and the line at right angles from the middle of the gate leads to a convent of nuns, which must certainly have come down. This was presently perceived, and besides the rich and higher classes might not have liked to settle in the remote quarter. The artist perhaps died, and therefore the door was closed, and so an end was put to the affair.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe portico of the theatre, consisting of six large Ionic columns, looks handsome enough. So much the more puny is the appearance of the Marchese di Maffei's bust, which as large as life, and in a great wig, stands over the door, and in front of a painted niche, which is supported by two Corinthian columns. The position is honorable, but to be in some degree proportionate to the magnitude and solidity of the columns, the bust should have been colossal. But now placed as it is on a corbel, it has a mean appearance, and is by no means in harmony with the whole.\nThe gallery, which incloses the fore-court, is also small, and the channelled Doric dwarfs have a mean appearance by the side of the smooth Ionic giants. But we pardon this discrepancy on account of the fine institution, which has been founded among the columns. Here is kept a number of antiquities, which have mostly been dug up in and about Verona. Something, they say, has even been found in the Amphitheatre. There are Etruscan, Greek, and Roman specimens, down to the latest times, and some even of more modern date. The bas-reliefs are inserted in the walls, and provided with the numbers, which Maffei gave them, when he described them in his work: \"Verona illustrata.\" There are altars, fragments of columns, and other relics of the sort; an admirable tripod of white marble, upon which there are genii occupied with the attributes of the gods. Raphael has imitated and improved this kind of thing in the scrolls of the Farnesina.\nThe wind which blows from the graves of the ancients, comes fragrantly over hills of roses. The tombs give touching evidences of a genuine feeling, and always bring life back to us. Here is a man, by the side of his wife, who peeps out of a niche, as if it were a window. Here are father and mother, with their son between them, eyeing each other as naturally as possible. Here a couple are grasping each other's hands. Here a father, resting on his couch, seems to be amused by his family. The immediate proximity of these stones was to me highly touching. They belong to a later school of art, but are simple, natural, and generally pleasing. Here a man in armour is on his knees in expectation of a joyful resurrection. With more or less of talent the artist has produced the mere simple presence of the persons, and has thus given a permanent continuation to their existence. They do not fold their hands, they do not look towards heaven, but they are here below just what they were and just what they are. They stand together, take interest in each other, love one another, and this is charmingly expressed on the stone, though with a certain want of technical skill. A marble pillar, very richly adorned, gave me more new ideas.\nLaudable as this institution is, we can plainly perceive that the noble spirit of preservation, by which it was founded, is no longer continued. The valuable tripod will soon be ruined, placed as it is in the open air, and exposed to the weather towards the west. This treasure might easily be preserved in a wooden case.\nThe palace of the Proveditore, which is begun, might have afforded a fine specimen of architecture, if it had been finished. Generally speaking, the nobili build a great deal, but unfortunately every one builds on the site of his former residence, and often, therefore, in narrow lanes. Thus, for instance, a magnificent façade to a seminary is now building in an alley of tire remotest suburb.\n\nWhile, with a guide, whom I had accidentally picked up, I passed before the great solemn gate of a singular building, he asked me good-humouredly, whether I should not like to step into the court for a while. It was the palace of justice, and the court, on account of the height of the building, looked only like an enormous wall. Here, he told me, all the criminals and suspicious persons are confined. I looked around, and saw that round all the stories there were open passages' fitted with iron balustrades, which passed by numerous doors. The prisoner, as he stepped out of his dungeon to be led to trial, stood in the open air, and was exposed to the gaze of all passers, and because there were several trial-rooms, the chains were rattling, now over this, now over that passage, in every story. It was a hateful sight, and I do not deny that the good humour, with which I had dispatched my \"Birds,\" might here have come into a strait.\n\nI walked at sunset upon the margin of the crater-like amphitheatre, and enjoyed the most splendid prospect over the town and the surrounding country. I was quite alone, and multitudes of people were passing below me on the hard stones of the Bra; men of all ranks, and women of the middle-ranks were walking. The latter in their black outer garments look, in this bird's-eye view, like so many mummies.\nThe Zendale and the Veste, which serves this class in the place of an entire wardrobe, is a costume completely fitted for a people that does not care much for cleanliness, and yet always likes to appear in public, sometimes at church, sometimes on the promenade. The Veste is a gown of black taffeta, which is thrown over other gowns. If the lady has a clean white one beneath, she contrives to lift up the black one on one side. This is fastened on so, as to cut the waist, and to cover the lappets of a corset, which may be of any colour. The Zendale is a large hood with long ears; the hood itself is kept high above the head by a wire-frame, while the ears are fastened round the body like a scarf, so that the ends fall down behind.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nWhen I again left the Arena to-day, I came to a modern public spectacle, about a thousand paces from the spot. Four noble Veronese were playing ball against four people of Vicenza. This pastime is carried on among the Veronese themselves all the year round, about two hours before night. On this occasion there was a far larger concourse of people than usual, on account of the foreign adversaries. The spectators seem to have amounted to four or five thousand. I did not see women of any rank.\nWhen, a little while ago, I spoke of the necessities of the multitude in such a case, I described the natural accidental amphitheatre as arising just in the manner, in which I saw the people raised one over another on this occasion. Even at a distance I could hear the lively clapping of hands, which accompanied every important stroke. The game is played as follows: Two boards, slightly inclined, are placed at a convenient distance from each other. He who strikes off the ball stands at the higher end, his right hand is armed with a broad wooden ring, set with spikes. While another of his party throws the ball to him, he runs down to meet it, and thus increases the force of the blow with which he strikes it. The adversaries try to beat it back, and thus it goes backwards and forwards till, at last, it remains on the ground. The most beautiful attitudes, worthy of being imitated in marble, are thus produced. As there are none but well-grown active young people, in a short, close, white dress, the parties are only distinguished by a yellow mark. Particularly beautiful is the attitude into which the man on the eminence falls, when he runs down the inclined plain, and raises his arm to strike the ball;—it approaches that of the Borghesian gladiator.\nIt seemed strange to me that they carry on this exercise by an old lime-wall, without the slightest convenience for spectators; why is it not done in the amphitheatre, where there would be such ample room?\n\nVerona, September 17.\nWhat I have seen of pictures I will but briefly touch upon, and add some remarks. I do not make this extraordinary tour for the sake of deceiving myself, but to become acquainted with myself by means of these objects. I therefore honestly confess that of the painter's art—of his manipulation, I understand but little. My attention, and observation, can only be directed to the practical part, to the subject, and the general treatment of it.\nS. Georgio is a gallery of good pictures, all altar-pieces, and all remarkable, if not of equal value. But what subjects were the hapless artists obliged to paint? And for whom? Perhaps a shower of manna thirty feet long, and twenty feet high, with the miracle of the loaves as a companion. What could be made of these subjects? Hungry men falling on little grains, and a countless multitude of others, to whom bread is handed. The artists have racked their invention in order to get something striking out of such wretched subjects. And yet, stimulated by the urgency of the case, genius has produced some beautiful things. An artist, who had to paint S. Ursula with the eleven thousand virgins, has got over the difficulty cleverly enough. The saint stands in the foreground, as if she had conquered the country. She is very noble, like an Amazonia's virgin, and without any enticing charms; on the other hand, her troop is shown descending from the ships, and moving in procession at a diminishing distance. The Assumption of the Virgin, by Titian, in the dome, has become much blackened, and it is a thought worthy of praise that, at the moment of her apotheosis, she looks not towards heaven, but towards her friends below.\nIn the Gherardini Gallery I found some very fine things by Orbitto, and for the first time became acquainted with this meritorious artist. At a distance we only hear of the first artists, and then we are often contented with names only; but when we draw nearer to this starry sky, and the luminaries of the second and third magnitude also begin to twinkle, each one coming forward and occupying his proper place in the whole constellation, then the world becomes wide, and art becomes rich. I must here commend the conception of one of the pictures. Sampson has gone to sleep in the lap of Dalilah, and she has softly stretched her hand over him to reach a pair of scissors, which lies near the lamp on the table. The execution is admirable. In the Canopa Palace I observed a Danäe.\nThe Bevilagua Palace contains the most valuable things. A picture by Tintoretto, which is called a \"Paradise,\" but which, in fact, represents the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, in the presence of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, saints, angels, &c., affords an opportunity for displaying all the riches of the most felicitous genius. To admire and enjoy all that care of manipulation, that spirit and variety of expression, it is necessary to possess the picture, and to have it before one all one's life. The painter's work is carried on ad infinitum,; even the farthest angels' heads, which are vanishing in the halo, preserve something of character. The largest figures may be about a foot high; Mary, and the Christ who is crowning her, about four inches. Eve is, however, the finest woman in the picture; a little voluptuous, as from time immemorial.\nA couple of portraits by Paul Veronese have only increased my veneration for that artist. The collection of antiquities is very fine; there is a son of Niobe extended in death, which is highly valuable; and the busts, including an Augustus with the civic crown, a Caligula, and others, are mostly of great interest, notwithstanding the restoration of the noses.\nIt lies in my nature to admire, willingly and joyfully, all that is great and beautiful, and the cultivation of this talent, day after day, hour after hour, by the inspection of such beautiful objects, produces the happiest feelings.\nIn a land, where we enjoy the days but take especial delight in the evenings, the time of nightfall is highly important. For now work ceases; those who have gone out walking turn back; the father wishes to have his daughter home again; the day has an end. What the day is we Cimmerians hardly know. In our eternal mist and fog it is the same thing to us, whether it be day or night, for how much time can we really pass and enjoy in the open air? Now, when night sets in, the day, which consisted of a morning and an evening, is decidedly past, four and twenty hours are gone, the bells ring, the rosary is taken in hand, and the maid, entering the chamber with the lighted lamp, says, \"felicissima notte.\" This epoch varies with every season, and a man who lives here in actual life cannot go wrong, because all the enjoyments of his existence are regulated not by the nominal hour, but by the time of day. If the people were forced to use a German clock they would be perplexed, for their own is intimately connected with their nature. About an hour and a half, or an hour before midnight, the nobility begin to ride out. They proceed to the Piazza della Bra, along the long, broad street to the Porta Nuova out at the gate, and along the city, and when night sets in, they all return home. Sometimes they go to the churches to say their Ave Maria della sera: sometimes they keep on the Bra, where the cavaliers step up to the coaches and converse for a while with the ladies. The foot passengers remain till a late hour of night, but I have never stopped till the last. To-day just enough rain had fallen to lay the dust, and the spectacle was most cheerful and animated.\nThat I may accommodate myself the better to the custom of the country I have devised a plan for mastering more easily the Italian method of reckoning the hours. The accompanying diagram may give an idea of it. The inner circle denotes our four and twenty hours, from midnight to midnight, divided into twice twelve, as we reckon, and as our clocks indicate. The middle circle shows how the clocks strike at the present season, namely, as much as twelve twice in the twenty-four hours, but in such a way that it strikes one, when it strikes eight with us, and so on till the number twelve is complete. At eight o'clock in the morning according to our clock it again strikes one, and so on. Finally the outer circle shows how the four and twenty hours are reckoned in actual life. For example, I hear seven o'clock striking in the night, and know that midnight is at five o'clock; I therefore deduct the latter number from the former, and thus have two hours after midnight. If I hear seven o'clock strike in the day-time, and know that noon is at five, I proceed in the same way, and thus have two in the afternoon. But if I wish to express the hour according to the fashion of this country, I must know that noon is seventeen o'clock; I add the two, and get nineteen o'clock. When this method is heard and thought of for the first time, it seems extremely confused and difficult to manage, but we soon grow accustomed to it and find the occupation amusing. The people themselves take delight in this perpetual calculation, just as children are pleased with easily surmounted difficulties. Indeed they always have their fingers in the air, make any calculation in their heads, and like to occupy themselves with figures. Besides to the inhabitant of the country the matter is so much the easier, as he really does not trouble himself about noon and midnight, and does not, like the foreign resident, compare two clocks with each other. They only count from the evening the hours, as they strike, and in the day-time they add the number to the varying number of noon, with which they are acquainted. The rest is explained by the remarks appended to the diagram:—\nVerona, Sept. 17.\nThe people here jostle one another actively enough; the narrow streets, where shops and workmen's stalls are thickly crowded together, have a particularly cheerful look. There is no such thing as a door in front of the shop or workroom; the whole breadth of the house is open, and one may see all that passes in the interior. Half-way out into the path, the tailors are sewing; and the cobblers are pulling and rapping; indeed the work-stalls make a part of the street. In the evening, when the lights are burning, the appearance is most lively.\nThe squares are very full on market days; there are fruit and vegetables without number, and garlic and onions to the heart's desire. Then again throughout the day there is a ceaseless screaming, bantering, singing, squalling, huzzaing, and laughing. The mildness of the air, and the cheapness of the food, make subsistence easy. Everything possible is done in the open air.\nAt night singing and all sorts of noises begin. The ballad of \"Marlbrook\" is heard in every street;—then comes a dulcimer, then a violin. They try to imitate all the birds with a pipe. The strangest sounds are heard on every side. A mild climate can give this exquisite enjoyment of mere existence, even to poverty, and the very shadow of the people seems respectable.\nThe want of cleanliness and convenience, which so much strikes us in the houses, arises from the following cause:—the inhabitants are always out of doors, and in their light-heartedness think of nothing. With the people all goes right, even the middle-class man just lives on from day to day, while the rich and genteel shut themselves up in their dwellings, which are not so habitable as in the north. Society is found in the open streets. Fore-courts and colonnades are all soiled with filth, for things are done in the most natural manner. The people always feel their way before them. The rich man may be rich, and build his palaces; and the nobile may rule, but if he makes a colonnade or a fore-court, the people will make use of it for their own occasions, and have no more urgent wish than to get rid as soon as possible, of that which they have taken as often as possible. If a person cannot bear this, he must not play the great gentleman, that is to say, he must act as if a part of his dwelling belonged to the public. He may shut his door, and all will be right. But in open buildings the people are not to be debarred of their privileges, and this, throughout Italy, is a nuisance to the foreigner.\nTo-day I remarked in several streets of the town, the customs and manners of the middle-classes especially, who appear very numerous and busy. They swing their arms as they walk. Persons of a high rank, who on certain occasions wear a sword, swing only one arm, being accustomed to hold the left arm still.\nAlthough the people are careless enough with respect to their own wants and occupations, they have a keen eye for everything foreign. Thus in the very first days, I observed that every one took notice of my boots, because here they are too expensive an article of dress to wear even in winter. Now I wear shoes and stockings nobody looks at me. Particularly I noticed this morning, when all were running about with flowers, vegetables, garlic, and other market-stuff, that a twig of cypress, which I carried in my hand, did not escape them. Some green cones hung upon it, and I held in the same hand some blooming caper-twigs. Everybody, large and small, watched me closely, and seemed to entertain some whimsical thought.\nI brought these twigs from the Giusti garden, which is finely situated, and in which there are monstrous cypresses, all pointed up like spikes into the air. The Taxus, which in northern gardening we find cut to a sharp point, is probably an imitation of this splendid natural product. A tree, the branches of which, the oldest as well as the youngest, are striving to reach heaven,—a tree which will last its three hundred years, is well worthy of veneration. Judging from the time when this garden was laid out, these trees have already attained that advanced age.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThe way from Verona hither is very pleasant: we go north-eastwards along the mountains, always keeping to the left the foremost mountains, which consist of sand, lime, clay, and marl; the hills which they form, are dotted with villages, castles, and houses. To the right extends the broad plain, along which the road goes. The straight broad path, which is in good preservation, goes through a fertile field; we look into deep avenues of trees, up which the vines are trained to a considerable height, and then drop down, like pendant branches. Here we can get an admirable idea of festoons! The grapes are ripe, and are heavy on the tendrils, which hang down long and trembling. The road is filled with people of every class and occupation, and I was particularly pleased by some carts, with low solid wheels, which, with teams of fine oxen, carry the large vats, in which the grapes from the vineyards are put and pressed. The drivers rode in them when they were empty, and the whole was like a triumphal procession of Bacchanals. Between the ranks of vines the ground is used for all sorts of grain, especially Indian corn and millet (Sörgel).\nAs one goes towards Vicenza, the hills again rise from north to south and enclose the plain; they are, it is said, volcanic. Vicenza lies at their foot, or if you will, in a bosom which they form.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThough I have been here only a few hours, I have already run through the town, and seen the Olympian theatre, and the buildings of Palladio. A very pretty little book is published here, for the convenience of foreigners, with copper-plates and some letter-press, that shows knowledge of art. When once one stands in the presence of these works, one immediately perceives their great value, for they are calculated to fill the eye with their actual greatness and massiveness, and to satisfy the mind by the beautiful harmony of their dimensions, not only in abstract sketches, but with all the prominences and distances of perspective. Therefore I say of Palladio: he was a man really and intrinsically great, whose greatness was outwardly manifested. The chief difficulty with which this man, like all modern architects, had to struggle, was the suitable application of the orders of columns to buildings for domestic or public use; for there is always a contradiction in the combination of columns and walls. But with what success has he not worked them up together! What an imposing effect has the aspect of his edifices: at the sight of them one almost forgets that he is attempting to reconcile us to a violation of the rules of his art. There is, indeed, something divine about his designs, which may be exactly compared to the creations of the great poet, who, out of truth and falsehood elaborates something between both, and charms us with its borrowed existence.\nThe Olympic theatre is a theatre of the ancients, realized on a small scale, and indescribably beautiful. However, compared with our theatres, it reminds me of a genteel, rich, well-bred child, contrasted with a shrewd man of the world, who, though he is neither so rich, nor so genteel, and well-bred, knows better how to employ his resources.\nIf we contemplate, on the spot, the noble buildings which Palladio has erected, and see how they are disfigured by the mean filthy necessities of the people, how the plans of most of them exceeded the means of those who undertook them, and how little these precious monuments of one lofty mind are adapted to all else around, the thought occurs, that it is just the same with everything else; for we receive but little thanks from men, when we would elevate their internal aspirations, give them a great idea of themselves, and make them feel the grandeur of a really noble existence. But when one cajoles them, tells them tales, and helping them on from day to day, makes them worse, then one is just the man they like; and hence it is that modern times take delight in so many absurdities. I do not say this to lower my friends, I only say that they are so, and that people must not be astonished to find everything just as it is.\nHow the Basilica of Palladio looks by the side of an old castellated kind of a building, dotted all over with windows of different sizes (whose removal, tower and all, the artist evidently contemplated),—it is impossible to describe—and besides I must now, by a strange effort, compress my own feelings, for, I too, alas! find here side by side both what I seek and what I fly from.\n\nSept. 20.\nYesterday we had the opera, which lasted till midnight, and I was glad to get some rest. The three Sultanesses and the Rape of the Seraglio have afforded several tatters, out of which the piece has been patched up, with very little skill. The music is agreeable to the ear, but is probably by an amateur; for not a single thought struck me as being new. The ballets, on the other hand, were charming. The principle pair of dancers executed an Allemande to perfection.\nThe theatre is new, pleasant, beautiful, modestly magnificent, uniform throughout, just as it ought to be in a provincial town. Every box has hangings of the same color, and the one belonging to the Capitan Grande, is only distinguished from the rest, by the fact that the hangings are somewhat longer.\nThe prima donna, who is a great favorite of the whole people, is tremendously applauded, on her entrance, and the \"gods\" are quite obstreperous with their delight, when she does anything remarkably well, which very often happens. Her manners are natural, she has a pretty figure, a fine voice, a pleasing countenance, and, above all, a really modest demeanour, while there might be more grace in the arms. However, I am not what I was, I feel that I am spoiled, I am spoiled for a \"god.\"\n\nSept. 21.\nTo-day I visited Dr. Tura. Five years ago he passionately devoted himself to the study of plants, formed a herbarium of the Italian flora, and laid out a botanical garden under the superintendence of the former bishop. However, all that has come to an end. Medical practice drove away natural history, the herbarium is eaten by worms, the bishop is dead, and the botanic garden is again rationally planted with cabbages and garlic.\nDr. Tura is a very refined and good man. He told me his history with frankness, purity of mind, and modesty, and altogether spoke in a very definite and affable manner. At the same time he did not like to open his cabinets, which perhaps were in no very presentable condition. Our conversation soon came to a stand-still.\n\nSept. 21. Evening.\nI called upon the old architect Scamozzi, who has published an edition of Palladio's buildings, and is a diligent artist, passionately devoted to his art. He gave me some directions, being delighted with my sympathy. Among Palladio's buildings there is one, for which I always had an especial predilection, and which is said to have been his own residence When it is seen close, there is far more in it than appears in a picture. I should have liked to draw it, and to illuminate it with colors, to show the material and the age. It must not, however, be imagined that the architect has built himself a palace. The house is the most modest in the world, with only two windows, separated from each other by a broad space, which would admit a third. If it were imitated in a picture, which should exhibit the neighbouring houses at the same time, the spectator would be pleased to observe how it has been let in between them. Canaletto was the man who should have painted it.\n\nTo-day I visited the splendid building which stands on a pleasant elevation about half a league from the town, and is called the \"Rotonda.\" It is a quadrangular building, enclosing a circular hall, lighted from the top. On all the four sides, you ascend a broad flight of steps, and always come to a vestibule, which is formed of six Corinthian columns. Probably the luxury of architecture was never carried to so high a point. The space occupied by the steps and vestibules is much larger than that occupied by the house itself; for every one of the sides is as grand and pleasing as the front of a temple. With respect to the inside it may be called habitable, but not comfortable. The hall is of the finest proportions, and so are the chambers; but they would hardly suffice for the actual wants of any genteel family in a summer-residence. On the other hand it presents a most beautiful appearance, as it is viewed on every side throughout the district. The variety which is produced by the principal mass, as, together with the projecting columns, it is gradually brought before the eyes of the spectator who walks round it, is very great; and the purpose of the owner, who wished to leave a large trust-estate, and at the same time a visible monument of his wealth, is completely obtained. And while the building appears in all its magnificence, when viewed from any spot in the district, it also forms the point of view for a most agreeable prospect. You may see the Bachiglione flowing along, and taking vessels down from Verona to the Brenta, while you overlook the extensive possessions which the Marquis Capra wished to preserve undivided in his family. The inscriptions on the four gable-ends, which together constitute one whole, are worthy to be noted down:\nMarcus Capra Gabrielis filius\nQui ædes has Arctissimo\nprimogenituræ gradui subjecit\nUna cum omnibus\nCensibus agrisvallibus et collibus\nCitra viam magnam\nMemorise perpetuæ mandans hæc\nDum sustinet ac abstinet.\nThe conclusion in particular is strange enough. A man who has at command so much wealth and such a capacious will, still feels that he must bear and forbear. This can be learned at a less expense.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis evening I was at a meeting held by the academy of the \"Olympians.\" It is mere play-work, but good in its way, and seems to keep up a little spice and life among the people. There is the great hall by Palladio's theatre, handsomely lighted up; the Capitan and a portion of the nobility are present, besides a public composed of educated persons, and several of the clergy; the whole assembly amounting to about five hundred.\nThe question proposed by the president for to-day's sitting was this: \"Which has been most serviceable to the fine arts, invention or imitation?\" This was a happy notion, for if the alternatives which are involved in the question are kept duly apart, one may go on debating for centuries. The academicians have gallantly availed themselves of the occasion, and have produced all sorts of things in prose and verse,—some very good.\nThen there is the liveliest public. The audience cry bravo, and clap their hands and laugh. What a thing it is to stand thus before one's nation, and amuse them in person! We must set down our best productions in black and white; every one squats down with them in a corner, and scribbles at them as he can.\nIt may be imagined that even on this occasion Palladio would be continually appealed to, whether the discourse was in favour of invention or imitation. At the end, which is always the right place for a joke, one of the speakers hit on a happy thought, and said that the others had already taken Palladio away from him, so that he, for his part, would praise Franceschini, the great silk-manufacturer. He then began to show the advantages which this enterprising man, and through him the city of Vicenza, had derived from imitating the Lyonnese and Florentine stuffs, and thence came to the conclusion that imitation stands far above invention. This was done with so much humour, that uninterrupted laughter was excited. Generally those who spoke in favor of imitation obtained the most applause, for they said nothing but what was adapted to the thoughts and capacities of the multitude. Once the public, by a violent clapping of hands, gave its hearty approval to a most clumsy sophism, when it had not felt many good—nay, excellent things, that had been said in honour of invention. I am very glad I have witnessed this scene, for it is highly gratifying to see Palladio, after the lapse of so long a time, still honoured by his fellow-citizens, as their polar-star and model.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis morning I was at Tiene, which lies north towards the mountains, where a new building has been erected after an old plan, of which there may be a little to say. Thus do they here honour everything that belongs to the good period, and have sense enough to raise a new building on a plan which they have inherited. The château is excellently situated in a large plain, having behind it the calcareous Alps, without any mountains intervening. A stream of living water flows along the level causeway from each side of the building, towards those who approach it, and waters the broad fields of rice through which one passes.\nI have now seen but two Italian cities, and for the first time, and have spoken with but few persons, and yet I know my Italians pretty well. They are like courtiers, who consider themselves the first people in the world, and who, on the strength of certain advantages, which cannot be denied them, can indulge with impunity in so comfortable a thought. The Italians appear to me a right good people. Only one must see the children and the common people as I see them now, and can see them, while I am always open to them,—nay, always lay myself open to them. What figures and faces there are!\nIt is especially to be commended in the Vicentians, that with them one enjoys the privileges of a large city. Whatever a person does, they do not stare at him, but if he addresses them, they are conversable and pleasant, especially the women, who please me much. I do not mean to find fault with the Veronese women; they are well made and have a decided pupil, but they are, for the most part, pale, and the Zendal is to their disadvantage, because one looks for something charming under the beautiful costume. I have found here some very pretty creatures, especially some with black locks, who inspire me with peculiar interest. There are also fairer beauties who, however, do not please me so well.\n\nPadua, Sept. 26. Evening.\nIn four hours I have this day come here from Vicenza, crammed luggage and all into a little one-seated chaise, called a \"Sediola.\" Generally the journey is performed with ease in three hours and a half, but as I wished to pass the delightful day-time in the open air, I was glad that the Vetturino fell short of his duty. The route goes constantly southwards over the most fertile plains, and between hedges and trees, without further prospect, until at last the beautiful mountains, extending from the east towards the south, are seen on the right hand. The abundance of the festoons of plants and fruit, which hang over walls and hedges, and down the trees, is indescribable. The roofs are loaded with gourds, and the strangest sort of cucumbers are hanging from poles and trellises.\nFrom the observatory I could take the clearest survey possible of the fine situation of the town. Towards the north are the Tyrolese mountains, covered with snow, and half hidden by clouds, and joined by the Vicentian mountains on the north-west. Then towards the west are the nearer mountains of Este, the shapes and recesses of which are plainly to be seen. Towards the south-east is a verdant sea of plants, without a trace of elevation, tree after tree, bush after bush, plantation after plantation, while houses, villas, and churches, dazzling with whiteness, peer out from among the green. Against the horizon I plainly saw the tower of St. Mark's at Venice, with other smaller towers.\n\nPadua, Sept. 27.\nI have at last obtained the works of Palladio, not indeed the original edition, which I saw at Vicenza, where the cuts are in wood, but a fac-simile in copper, published at the expense of an excellent man, named Smith, who was formerly the English consul at Venice. We must give the English this credit, that they have long known how to prize what is good, and have a magnificent way of diffusing it.\nOn the occasion of this purchase I entered a book-shop, which in Italy presents quite a peculiar appearance. Around it are arranged the books, all stitched, and during the whole day good society may be found in the shop, which is a lounge for all the secular clergy, nobility, and artists who are in any way connected with literature. One asks for a book, opens it, and amuses himself as one can. Thus I found a knot of half a dozen all of whom became attentive to me, when I asked for the works of Palladio. While the master of the shop looked for the book, they commended it, and gave me information respecting the original and the copy; they were well acquainted with the work itself and with the merits of the author. Taking me for an architect they praised me for having recourse to this master in preference to all the rest, saying that he was of more practical utility than Vitruvius himself, since he had thoroughly studied the ancients and antiquity, and had sought to adapt the latter to the wants of our own times. I conversed for a long time with these friendly men, learned something about the remarkable objects in the city, and took my leave.\nWhere men have built churches to saints, a place may sometimes be found in them, where monuments to intellectual men may be set up. The bust of Cardinal Bembo stands between Ionic columns. It is a handsome face, strongly drawn in, if I may use the expression, and with a copious beard. The inscription runs thus: \"Petri Bembi Card. imaginem Hier. Guerinus Ismeni f. in publico ponendam curavit ut cujus ingenii monumenta æterna sint, ejus corporis quoque memoria ne a posteritate desideretur.\"\nWith all its dignity the University gave me the horrors, as a building. I am glad that I had nothing to learn in it. One cannot imagine such a narrow compass for a school, even though, as the student of a German university, one may have suffered a great deal on the benches of the Auditorium. The anatomical theatre is a perfect model of the art of pressing students together. The audience are piled one above another in a tall pointed funnel. They look down upon the narrow space where the table stands, and, as no daylight falls upon it, the Professor must demonstrate by lamplight. The botanic garden is much more pretty and cheerful. Several plants can remain in the ground during the winter, if they are set near the walls, or at no great distance from them. At the end of October the whole is built over, and the process of heating is carried on for the few remaining months. It is pleasant and instructive to walk through a vegetation that is strange to us. With ordinary plants, as well as with other objects that have been long familiar to us, we at last do not think at all, and what is looking without thinking? Amidst this variety which comes upon me quite new, the idea that all forms of plants may, perhaps, be developed from a single form, becomes more lively than ever. On this principle alone it would be possible to define orders and classes, which, it seems to me, has hitherto been done in a very arbitrary manner. At this point I stand fast in my botanical philosophy, and I do not see how I am to extricate myself. The depth and breadth of this business seem to me quite equal.\nThe great square, called Prato della Valle, is a very wide space, where the chief fair is held in June. The wooden booths in the middle of it do not produce the most favourable appearance, but the inhabitants assure me that there will soon be a fièra of stone here, like that at Verona. One has hopes of this already, from the manner in which the Prato is surrounded, and which affords a very beautiful and imposing view.\nA huge oval is surrounded with statues, all representing celebrated men, who have taught or studied at the University. Any native or foreigner is allowed to erect a statue of a certain size to any countryman or kinsman, as soon as the merit of the person and his academical residence at Padua are proved.\nA moat filled with water goes round the oval. On the four bridges which lead up to it stand colossal figures of Popes and Doges; the other statues, which are smaller, have been set up by corporations, private individuals, or foreigners. The King of Sweden caused a figure of Gustavus Adolphus to be erected, because it is said he once heard a lecture in Padua. The Archduke Leopold revived the memory of Petrarch and Galileo. The statues are in a good, modern style, a few of them rather affected, some very natural, and all in the costume of their rank and dignity. The inscriptions deserve commendation. There is nothing in them absurd or paltry.\nAt any university the thought would have been a happy one (and here it is particularly so), because it is very delightful to see a whole line of departed worthies thus called back again. It will perhaps form a very beautiful Prato, when the wooden Fièra shall be removed, and one built of stone, according to the aforesaid plan.\nIn the consistory of a fraternity dedicated to S. Anthony, there are some pictures of an early date, which remind one of the old German paintings, and also some by Titian, in which may be remarked the great progress which no one has made on the other side of the Alps. Immediately afterwards I saw works by some of the most modern painters. These artists, as they could not hope to succeed in the lofty and the serious, have been very happy in hitting the humorous. The decollation of John by Piazetta is, in this sense, a capital picture, if one can once allow the master's manner. John is kneeling, with his hands before him, and his right knee on a stone, looking towards heaven. One of the soldiers, who is binding him, is bending round on one side, and looking into his face, as if he was wondering at his patient resignation. Higher up stands another, who is to deal the fatal blow. He does not, however, hold the sword, but makes a motion with his hands, like one who is practising the stroke beforehand. A third is drawing the sword out of the scabbard. The thought is happy, if not grand, and the composition is striking and produces the best effect.\nIn the church of the Eremitani I have seen pictures by Mantegna, one of the older painters, at which I am astonished. What a sharp, strict actuality is exhibited in these pictures! It is from this actuality, thoroughly true, not apparent, merely and falsely effective, and appealing solely to the imagination, but solid, pure, bright, elaborated, conscientious, delicate, and circumscribed—an actuality which had about it something severe, credulous, and laborious; it is from this, I say, that the later painters proceeded (as I remarked in the pictures of Titian), in order that by the liveliness of their own genius, the energy of their nature illumined at the same time by the mind of the predecessors, and exalted by their force, they might rise higher and higher, and elevated above the earth, produce forms that were heavenly indeed, but still true. Thus was art developed after the barbarous period.\nThe hall of audience in the town-house, properly designated by the augmentative \"Salone,\" is such a huge inclosure that one cannot conceive it, much less recall it to one's immediate memory. It is three hundred feet long, one hundred feet broad, and one hundred feet high, measured up to the roof, which covers it quite in. So accustomed are these people to live in the open air, that the architects look out for a market-place to over-arch. And there is no question that this huge vaulted space produces quite a peculiar effect. It is an inclosed infinity, which has more analogy to man's habits and feelings than the starry heavens. The latter takes us out of ourselves, the former insensibility brings us back to ourselves.\nFor the same reason I also like to stay in the Church of S. Justina. This church, which is eighty-five feet long, and high and broad in proportion, is built in a grand and simple style. This evening I seated myself in a corner, and indulged in quiet contemplation. Then I felt myself truly alone, for no one in the world, even if he had thought of me for the moment, would have looked for me here.\nNow everything ought to be packed up again, for to-morrow morning I set off by water, upon the Brenta. It rained to-day, but now it has cleared up, and I hope I shall be able to see the lagunes and the Bride of the Sea by beautiful daylight, and to greet my friends from her bosom.\n\nVENICE\nNow it stood written on my page in the Book of Fate, that on the evening of the 28th of September, by 5 o'clock, German time, I should see Venice for the first time, as I passed from the Brenta into the lagunes, and that, soon afterwards, I should actually enter: and visit this strange island-city, this heaven-like republic. So now, Heaven be praised, Venice is no longer to me a bare and a hollow name, which has so long tormented me,—me, the mental enemy of mere verbal sounds.\nAs the first of the gondoliers came up to the ship (they come in order to convey more quickly to Venice those passengers who are in a hurry), I recollected an old plaything, of which, perhaps, I had not thought for twenty years. My father had a beautiful model of a gondola which he had brought with him [from Italy]; he set a great value upon it, and it was considered a great treat, when I was allowed to play with it. The first beaks of tinned iron-plate, the black gondola-gratings, all greeted me like old acquaintances, and I experienced again dear emotions of my childhood which had been long unknown.\nI am well lodged at the sign of the Queen of England, not far from the square of S. Mark, which is, indeed, the chief advantage of the snot. My windows look upon a narrow canal between lofty houses, a bridge of one arch is immediately below me, and directly opposite is a narrow, bustling alley. Thus am I lodged, and here I shall remain until I have made up my packet for Germany, and until I am satiated with the sight of the city. I can now really enjoy the solitude for which I have longed so ardently, for nowhere does a man feel himself more solitary than in a crowd, where he must push his way unknown to every one. Perhaps in Venice there is only one person who knows me, and he will not come in contact with me all at once.\n\nVenice, September 28, 1786.\nA few words on my journey hither from Padua. The passage on the Brenta, in the public vessel, and in good company, is highly agreeable. The banks are ornamented with gardens and villas, little hamlets come down to the water's edge, and the animated highroad may be seen here and there. As the descent of the river is by means of locks, there is often a little pause, which may be employed in looking about the country, and in tasting the fruits, which are offered in great abundance. You then enter your vessel again, and move on through a world, which is itself in motion, and which is full of life and fertility.\nTo so many changing forms and images a phenomenon was added, which, although derived from Germany, was quite in its place here—I mean two pilgrims, the first whom I have seen closely. They have a right to travel gratis in this public conveyance; but because the rest of the passengers dislike coming into contact with them, they do not sit in the covered part, but in the after-part beside the steersman. They were stared at as a phenomenon even at the present day, and as in former times many vagabonds had made use of this cloak, they were but lightly esteemed. When I learned that they were Germans, and could speak no language but their own, I joined them, and found that they came from the Paderborn territory. Both of them were men of more than fifty years of age, and of a dark, but good-humoured physiognomy. They had first visited the sepulchre of the \"Three Kings\" at Cologne, had then travelled through Germany, and were now together on their way back to Borne and Upper Italy, whence one intended to set out for Westphalia, and the other to pay a visit of adoration to St. James of Compostella.\nTheir dress was the well-known costume of pilgrims, but they looked much better with this tucked up robe, than the pilgrims in long taffeta garments, we are accustomed to exhibit at our masquerades. The long cape, the round hat, the staff and cockle (the latter used as the most innocent drinking-vessel)—all had its signification, and its immediate use, while a tin-case held their passports. Most remarkable of all were their small, red morocco pocket-books, in which they kept all the little implements that might be wanted for any simple necessity. They took them out on finding that something wanted mending in their garments.\nThe steersman, highly pleased to find an interpreter, made me ask them several questions, and thus I learned a great deal about their views, and especially about their expedition. They made bitter complaints against their brethren in the faith, and even against the clergy, both secular and monastic. Piety, they said, must be a very scarce commodity, since no one would believe in theirs, but they were treated as vagrants in almost every Catholic country, although they produced the route which had been clerically prescribed, and the passports given by the bishop. On the other hand, they described, with a great deal of emotion, how well they had been received by protestants, and made special mention of a country clergyman in Suabia, and still more of his wife, who had prevailed on her somewhat unwilling husband to give them an abundant repast, of which they stood in great need. On taking leave, the good couple had given them a \"convention's dollar,\"[3] which they found very serviceable, as soon as they entered the Catholic territory. Upon this, one of them said, with all the elevation of which he was capable: \"We include this lady every day in our prayers, and implore God that he will open her eyes, as he has opened her heart towards us, and take her, although late, into the bosom of the Catholic Church. And thus we hope that we shall meet her in Paradise hereafter.\"\nAs I sat upon the little gang-way which led to the deck, I explained as much as was necessary and useful to the steers-man, and to some other persons who had crowded from the cabin into this narrow space. The pilgrims received some paltry donations, for the Italian is not fond of giving. Upon this they drew out some little consecrated tickets, on which might be seen the representation of the three sainted kings, with some prayers addressed to them. The worthy men entreated me to distribute these tickets among the little party, and explain how invaluable they were. In this I succeeded perfectly, for when the two men appeared to be greatly embarrassed as to how they should find the convent devoted to pilgrims in so large a place as Venice, the steersman was touched, and promised that, when they landed, he would give a boy a trifle to lead them to that distant spot. He added to me in confidence, that they would find but little welcome. \"The institution,\" he said, \"was founded to admit I don't know how many pilgrims, but now it has become greatly contracted, and the revenues are otherwise employed.\"\nDuring this conversation we had gone down the beautiful Brenta, leaving behind us many a noble garden, and many a noble palace, and casting a rapid glance at the populous and thriving hamlets, which lay along the banks. Several gondolas wound about the ship as soon as we had entered the lagunes. A Lombard, well acquainted with Venice, asked me to accompany him, that we might enter all the quicker, and escape the nuisance of the custom-house. Those who endeavoured to hold us back, he contrived to put off with a little drink-money, and so, in a cheerful sunset, we floated to the place of our destination.\n[3]\nA \"convention's dollar\" is a dollar coined in consequence of an agreement made between several of the German states, in the year 1750, when the Viennese standard was adopted.—Trans.\n\nSept. 29 (Michaelmas-Day). Evening.\nSo much has already been told and printed about Venice, that I shall not be circumstantial in my description, but shall only say how it struck me. Now, in this instance again, that which makes the chief impression upon me, is the people,—a great mass, who live an involuntary existence determined by the changing circumstances of the moment.\nIt was for no idle fancy that this race fled to these islands; it was no mere whim which impelled those who followed to combine with them; necessity taught them to look for security in a highly disadvantageous situation, that afterwards became most advantageous, enduing them with talent, when the whole northern world was immersed in gloom. Their increase and their wealth were a necessary consequence. New dwellings arose close against dwellings, rocks took the place of sand and marsh, houses sought the sky, being forced like trees inclosed in a narrow compass, to seek in height what was denied them in breadth. Being niggards of every inch of ground, as having been from the very first compressed into a narrow compass, they allowed no more room for the streets than was just necessary to separate a row of houses from the one opposite, and to afford the citizens a narrow passage. Moreover, water supplied the place of street, square, and promenade. The Venetian was forced to become a new creature; and thus Venice can only be compared with itself. The large canal, winding like a serpent, yields to no street in the world, and nothing can be put by the side of the space in front of St. Mark's square—I mean that great mirror of water, which is encompassed by Venice Proper, in the form of a crescent. Across the watery surface you see to the left the island of St. Georgio Maggiore, to the right a little, further off the Guidecca and its canal, and still more distant the Dogana (Custom-house) and the entrance into the Canal Grande, where right before us two immense marble temples are glittering in the sunshine. All the views and prospects have been so often engraved, that my friends will have no difficulty in forming a clear idea of them.\nAfter dinner I hastened to fix my first impression of the whole, and without a guide, and merely observing the cardinal points, threw myself into the labyrinth of the city, which though everywhere intersected by larger or smaller canals, is again connected by bridges. The narrow and crowded appearance of the whole cannot be conceived by one who has not seen it. In most cases one can quite or nearly measure the breadth of the street, by stretching out one's arms, and in the narrowest, a person would scrape his elbows if he walked with his arms a-kimbo. Some streets, indeed, are wider, and here and there is a little square, but comparatively all may be called narrow.\nI easily found the grand canal, and the principal bridge—the Rialto, which consists of a single arch of white marble. Looking down from this, one has a fine prospect,—the canal full of ships, which bring every necessary from the continent, and put in chiefly at this place to unload, while between them is a swarm of gondolas. To-day, especially, being Michaelmas, the view was wonderfully animated; but to give some notion of it, I must go back a little.\nThe two principal parts of Venice, which are divided by the grand canal, are connected by no other bridge than the Rialto, but several means of communication are provided, and the river is crossed in open boats at certain fixed points. To-day a very pretty effect was produced, by the number of well-dressed ladies, who, their features concealed beneath large black veils, were being ferried over in large parties at a time, in order to go to the church of the Archangel, whose festival was being solemnised. I left the bridge and went to one of the points of landing, to see the parties as they left the boats. I discovered some very fine forms and faces among them.\nAfter I had become tired of this amusement. I seated myself in a gondola, and, quitting the narrow streets with the intention of witnessing a spectacle of an opposite description, went along the northern part of the grand canal, into the lagunes, and then entered the canal della Guidecca, going as far as the square of St. Mark. Now was I also one of the birds of the Adriatic sea, as every Venetian feels himself to be, whilst reclining in his gondola. I then thought with due honour of my good father, who knew of nothing better than to talk about the things I now witnessed. And will it not be so with me likewise? All that surrounds me is dignified—a grand venerable work of combined human energies, a noble monument, not of a ruler, but of a people. And if their lagunes are gradually filling up, if unwholesome vapours are floating over the marsh, if their trade is declining and their power has sunk, still the great place and the essential character will not for a moment, be less venerable to the observer. Venice succumbs to time, like everything that has a phenomenal existence.\n\nSept. 30.\nTowards evening I again rambled, without a guide, into the remotest quarters of the city. The bridges here are all provided with stairs, that gondolas, and even larger vessels, may pass conveniently under the arches. I sought to find my way in and out of this labyrinth, without asking anybody, and, on this occasion also, only guiding myself by the points of the compass. One disentangles one's self at last, but it is a wonderful complication, and my manner of obtaining a sensible impression of it, is the best. I have now been to the remotest points of the city, and observed the conduct, mode of life, manners, and character of the inhabitants; and in every quarter they are different. Gracious Heaven!—What a poor good sort of animal man is, after all!\nMost of the smaller houses stand immediately on the canals, but there are here and there quays of stone, beautifully paved, along which one may take a pleasant walk between the water, and the churches, and palaces. Particularly cheerful and agreeable is the long stone quay on the northern side, from which the islands are visible, especially Murano, which is a Venice on a small scale. The intervening lagunes are all alive with little gondolas.\n\nSept. 30. Evening.\nTo-day I have enlarged my notions of Venice by procuring a plan of it. When I had studied it for some time, I ascended the tower of St. Mark, where an unique spectacle is presented to the eye. It was noon, and the sun was so bright that I could see places near and distant without a glass. The tide covered the lagunes, and when I turned my eyes towards what is called the Lido (this is a narrow strip of earth, which bounds the lagunes), I saw the sea for the first time with some sails upon it. In the lagunes themselves some gallies and frigates are lying, destined to join the Chevalier Emo, who is making war on the Algerines, but detained by unfavorable winds. The mountains of Padua and Vicenza, and the mountain-chain of Tyrol, beautifully bound the picture between the north and west.\n\nOctober 1.\nI went out and surveyed the city from many points of view, and as it was Sunday, I was struck by the great want of cleanliness in the streets, which forced me to make some reflections. There seems to be a sort of policy in this matter, for the people scrape the sweepings into the corners, and I see large ships going backwards and forwards, which at several points He to, and take off the accumulation. They belong to the people of the surrounding islands, who are in want of manure. But, however, there is neither consistency nor strictness in this method, and the want of cleanliness in the city is the more unpardonable, as in it, as much provision has been made for cleaning it, as in any Dutch town.\nAll the streets are paved—even those in the remotest quarters, with bricks at least, which are laid down lengthwise, with the edges slightly canting: the middle of the street where necessary is raised a little, while channels are formed on each side to receive the water, and convey it into covered drains. There are other architectural arrangements in the original well-considered plan, which prove the intention of the excellent architects to make Venice the most cleanly, as well as the most singular of cities. As I walked along I could not refrain from sketching a body of regulations on the subject, anticipating in thought some superintendent of police, who might act in earnest. Thus one always feels an inclination to sweep one's neighbour's door.\n\nOct. 2, 1786.\nBefore all things I hastened to the Carità. I had found in Palladio's works that he had planned a monastic building here, in which he intended to represent a private residence of the rich and hospitable ancients. The plan, which was excellently drawn, both as a whole and in detail, gave me infinite delight, and I hoped to find a marvel. Alas! scarcely a tenth part of the edifice is finished. However, even this part is worthy of that heavenly genius. There is a completeness in the plan, and an accuracy in the execution, which I had never before witnessed. One ought to pass whole years in the contemplation of such a work. It seems to me that I have seen nothing grander, nothing more perfect, and I fancy that I am not mistaken. Only imagine the admirable artist, born with an inner feeling for the grand and the pleasing, now, for the first time, forming himself by the ancients, with incredible labour, that he may be the means of reviving them. He finds an opportunity to carry out a favorite thought in building a convent, which is destined as a dwelling for so many monks, and a shelter for so many strangers, in the form of an antique private residence.\nThe church was already standing and led to an atrium of Corinthian columns. Here one feels delighted, and forgets all priestcraft. At one end, the sacristy, at another, a chapter-room is found, while there is the finest winding stair-case in the world, with a wide well, and the stone-steps built into the wall, and so laid, that one supports another. One is never tired of going up and down this stair-case, and we may judge of its success, from the fact that Palladio himself declares that he has succeeded. The fore-court leads to the large inner-court. Unfortunately, nothing is finished of the building which was to surround this, except the left side. Here there are three rows of columns, one over the other; on the ground-floor are the halls, on the first story is an archway in front of the cells, and the upper story consists of a plain wall with windows. However, this description should be illustrated by a reference to the sketches. I will just add a word about the execution.\nOnly the capitals and bases of the columns, and the key-stones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is—I will not say of brick, but-of burned clay. This description of tile I never saw before. The frieze and cornice are of the same material, as well as the parts of the arch. All is but half burnt, and lastly the building is put together with a very little lime. As it stands it looks as if it had been produced at one cast. If the whole had been finished, and it had been properly rubbed up and coloured, it would have been a charming sight.\nHowever, as so often happens with buildings of a modern time, the plan was too large. The artist had pre-supposed not only that the existing convent would be pulled down, but also that the adjoining houses would be bought, and here money and inclination probably began to fail. Kind Destiny, thou who hast formed and perpetuated so much stupidity, why didst thou not allow this work to be completed!\n\nOct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n\nOctober 3.\nYesterday evening I went to the Opera at the S. Moses (for the theatres take their name from the church to which they lie nearest); nothing very delightful! In the plan, the music, and the singers, that energy was wanting, which alone can elevate opera to the highest point. One could not say of any part that it was bad, but the two female actresses alone took pains, not so much to act well, but to set themselves off and to please. That is something, after all. These two actresses have beautiful figures, and good voices, and are nice, lively, compact, little bodies. Among the men, on the other hand, there is no trace of national power, or even of pleasure, in working on the imaginations of their audience. Neither is there among them any voice of decided brilliancy.\nThe ballet, which was wretchedly conceived, was condemned as a whole, but some excellent dancers and danseuses, the latter of whom considered it their duty to make the spectators acquainted with all their person charms, were heartily applauded.\n\nOctober 5.\nTo-day, however, I saw another comedy, which gave me more pleasure. In the ducal palace I heard the public discussion of a law case. It was important, and, happily for me, was brought forward in the holidays. One of the advocates had all the qualifications for an exaggerated buffo. His figure was short and fat, but supple; in profile his features were monstrously prominent. He had a stentorian voice, and a vehemence as if everything that he said came in earnest from the very bottom of his heart. I call this a comedy, because, probably, everything had been already prepared when the public exhibition took place. The judges knew what they had to say, and the parties what they had to expect. However, this plan pleases me infinitely more than our hobbling law affairs. I will endeavor to give some notion of the particulars, and of the neat, natural, and unostentatious manner in which everything takes place.\nIn a spacious hall of the palace the judges were sitting on one side, in a half circle. Opposite to them, in a tribune which could hold several persons, were the advocates for both parties; and upon a bench immediately in front of them, the plantiff, and defendant in person. The advocate for the plaintiff had descended from the tribune, since there was to be no controversy at this day's sitting. All the documents, on both sides, were to be read, although they were already printed.\nA lean clerk, in a black scanty gown, and with a thick bundle in his hand, prepared to perform the office of a reader. The hall was completely crammed with persons who came to see and to hear. The point of law itself, and the persons whom it concerned, must have appeared highly important to the Venetians.\nTrust-estates are so decidedly secured in Venice, that a property once stamped with this character, preserves it for ever, though it may have been divested ages ago by appropriations or other circumstances, and though it may have passed through ever so many hands. When the matter comes into dispute the descendants of the first family recover their right, and the property must be delivered up.\nOn this occasion the discussion was highly important, for the action was brought against the doge himself, or rather against his wife, who veiled by her zendal, or little hood, sat only at a little distance from the plaintiff. She was a lady of a certain age, of noble stature, and with well-formed features, in which there was something of an earnest, not to say fretful character. The Venetians make it a great boast that the princess in her own palace, is obliged to appear before them and the tribunal.\nWhen the clerk began to read, I for the first time clearly discerned the business of a little man who sat on a low stool behind a small table opposite the judges, and near the advocates. More especially I learned the use of an hour-glass, which was placed before him. As long as the clerk reads, time is not heeded, but the advocate is only allowed a certain time, if he speaks in the course of the reading. The clerk reads, and the hour-glass lies in a horizontal position, with the little man's hand upon it. As soon as the advocate opens his mouth, the glass is raised, and sinks again, as soon as he is silent. It is the great duty of the advocate to make remarks on what is read, to introduce cursory observations in order to excite and challenge attention. This puts the little Saturn in a state of the greatest perplexity. He is obliged every moment to change the horizontal and vertical position of the glass, and finds himself in the situation of the evil spirits in the puppet-show, who by the quickly varying \"Berliche, Berloche\" of the mischievous Hanswurst[4], are puzzled whether they are to come or to go.\nWhoever has heard documents read over in a law-court, can imagine the reading on this occasion,—quick and monotonous, but plain and articulate enough. The ingenious advocate contrives to interrupt the tedium by jests, and the public shows its delight in his jokes by immoderate laughter. I must mention one, the most striking of those I could understand. The reader was just reciting the document, by which, one, who was considered to have been illegally possessed of it, had disposed of the property in question. The advocate bade him lead more slowly, and when he plainly uttered the words: \"I give and bequeath,\" the orator flew violently at the clerk and cried: \"What will you give? What will you bequeath? you poor starved-out devil, nothing in the world belongs to you?\" \"However,\"—he continued, as he seemed to collect himself—\"the illustrious owner was in the same predicament. He wished to give, he wished to bequeath that which belonged to him no more than to you.\" A burst of inextinguishable laughter followed this sally, but the hour-glass at once resumed its horizontal position. The reader went mumbling on, and made a saucy face at the advocate; but all these jokes are prepared beforehand.\n[4]\nAn allusion to the comic scene, in the puppet-play of Faust, from which Göethe took the subject of his poem. One of the two magic words (Berliche, Berloche) summons the devils, the other drives them away, and the Hanswurst (or buffoon), in a mock-incantation scene, perplexes the fiends, by uttering one word after the other, as rapidly as possible.—Trans.\n\nOct. 4.\nI was yesterday at the play, in the theatre of S. Luke, and was highly pleased. I saw a piece acted extempore in masks, with a great deal of nature, energy, and vigour. The actors are not, indeed, all equal; the pantaloon is excellent, and one of the actresses, who is stout and well-built, speaks admirably, and deports herself cleverly, though she is no extraordinary actress. The subject of the piece is extravagant, and resembled that which is treated by us under the name of Der Verschlag (the partition). With inexhaustible variety it amused us for more than three hours. But even here the people is the base upon which everything rests, the spectators are themselves actors, and the multitude is melted into one whole with the stage. All day long the buyer and the seller, the beggar, the sailor, the female gossip, the advocate and his opponent, are living and acting in the square and on the bench, in the gondolas and in the palaces, and make it their business to talk and to asseverate, to cry and to offer for sale, to sing and to play, to curse and to brawl. In the evening they go into the theatre, and see and hear the life of the day artificially put together, prettily set off, interwoven with a story, removed from reality by the masks, and brought near to it by manners. In all this they take a childish delight and again shout and clap, and make a noise. From day to night,—nay, from midnight to midnight, it is always the same.\nI have not often seen more natural acting than that by these masks. It is such acting as can only be sustained by a remarkably happy talent and long practice.\nWhile I am writing this, they are making a tremendous noise on the canal under my window, though it is past midnight. Whether for good or for evil, they are always doing something.\n\nOctober 4.\nI have now heard public orators; viz., three fellows in the square and on the stone-bench, each telling tales after his fashion, two advocates, two preachers, and the actors, among whom I must especially commend the pantaloon. All these have something in common, both because they belong to one and the same nation, which, as it always lives in public, always adopts an impassioned manner of speaking, and because they imitate each other. There is besides a marked language of gesticulations, with which they accompany the expressions of their intentions, views, and feelings.\nThis day was the festival of S. Francis, and I was in his church Alle Vigne. The loud voice of the capuchin was accompanied by the cries of the salesmen in front of the church, as by an antiphone. I stood at the church-door between the two, and the effect was singular enough.\n\nOct. 5.\nThis morning I was in the arsenal, which I found interesting enough, though I know nothing of maritime affairs, and visited the lower school there. It has an appearance like that of an old family, which still bustles about, although its best time of blossom and fruit has passed. By paying attention to the handicraftsmen, I have seen much that is remarkable, and have been on board an eighty-four gun ship, the hull of which is just completed.\nSix months ago a thing of the sort was burned down to the water's edge, off the Riva dei Schiavoni. The powder-room was not very full, and when it blew up, it did no great damage. The windows of the neighbouring houses were destroyed.\nI have seen worked the finest oak from Istria, and have made my observations in return upon this valuable tree. That knowledge of the natural things used by man as materials, and employed for his wants, which I have acquired with so much difficulty, has been incalculably serviceable in explaining to me the proceedings of artists and artisans. The knowledge of mountains and of the stone taken out of them has been to me a great advance in art.\n\nOct. 5.\nTo give a notion of the Bucentaur in one word, I should say that it is a state-galley. The older one, of which we still have drawings, justified this appellation still more than the present one, which, by its splendour makes us forget its original.\nI am always returning to my old opinions. When a genuine subject is given to an artist, his productions will be something genuine also. Here the artist was commissioned to form a galley, worthy to carry the heads of the Republic, on the highest festivals in honour of its ancient rule on the sea; and the problem has been admirably solved. The vessel is all ornament; we ought to say, it is overladen with ornament; it is altogether one piece of gilt carving, for no other use, but that of a pageant to exhibit to the people its leaders in right noble style. We know well enough that a people, who likes to deck out its boats, is no less pleased to see their rulers bravely adorned. This state-galley is a good index to show what the Venetians were, and what they considered themselves.\n\nOct. 5. Night.\nI came home laughing from a tragedy, and must at once make the jest secure upon paper. The piece was not bad, the author had brought together all the tragic matadors, and the actors played well. Most of the situations were well known, but some were new and highly felicitous. There are two fathers, who hate each other, sons and daughters of these severed families, who respectively are passionately in love with each other, and one couple is even privately married. Wild and cruel work goes on, and at last nothing remains to render the young people happy, but to make the two fathers kill each other, upon which the curtain falls amid the liveliest applause. Now the applause becomes more vehement, now \"fuora\" was called out, and this lasted until the two principal couples vouchsafed to crawl forward from behind the curtain, make their bow, and retire at the opposite side.\nThe public was not yet satisfied, but went on clapping and crying: \"i morti!\" till the two dead men also come forward and made their bow, when some voices cried \"bravi i morti!\" The applause detained them for a long time, till at last they were allowed to depart. The effect is infinitely more droll to the eye-and-ear-witness, who, like me, has ringing in his ears the \"bravo! bravi!\" which the Italians have incessantly in their mouths, and then suddenly hears the dead also called forward with this word of honour.\nWe of the north can say \"good night\" at any hour, when we take leave after dark, but the Italian says: \"Felicissima notte\" only once, and that is when the candles are brought into a room. Day and night are thus divided, and something quite different is meant. So impossible is it to translate the idioms of any language! From the highest to the lowest word all has reference to the peculiarities of the natives, in character, opinions, or circumstances.\n\nOct. 6.\nThe tragedy yesterday taught me a great deal. In the first place, I have heard how the Italians treat and declaim their Eleven-syllable iambics, and in the next place, I have understood the tact of Gozzi in combining masks with his tragic personages. This is the proper sort of play for this people, which likes to be moved in a rough fashion. It has no tender, heart-felt sympathy for the unfortunate personage, but is only pleased when the hero speaks well. The Italians attach a great deal of importance to the speaking, and then they like to laugh, or to hear something silly.\nTheir interest in the drama is like that in a real event. When the tyrant gave his son a sword and required him to kill his own wife, who was standing opposite, the people began loudly to express their disapprobation of this demand, and there was a great risk that the piece would have been interrupted. They insisted that the old man should take his sword back, in which case all the subsequent situations in the drama would have been completely spoiled. At last, the distressed son plucked up courage, advanced to the proscenium, and humbly entreated that the audience would have patience for a moment, assuring them that all would turn out to their entire satisfaction. But even judging from an artistical point of view, this situation was, under the circumstances, silly and unnatural, and I commended the people for their feeling.\nI can now better understand the long speeches and the frequent dissertations, pro and con, in the Greek tragedy. The Athenians liked still more to hear speaking, and were still better judges of it, than the Italians. They learned something from the courts of law, where they spent the whole day.\n\nOct. 6.\nIn those works of Palladio, which are completed, I have found much to blame, together with much that is highly valuable. While I was thinking it over in my mind how far I was right or wrong in setting my judgment in opposition to that of so extraordinary a man, I felt as if he stood by and said, \"I did so and so against my will, but, nevertheless, I did it, because in this manner alone was it possible for me, under the given circumstances, to approximate to my highest idea.\" The more I think the matter over, it seems to me, that Palladio, while contemplating the height and width of an already existing church, or of an old house to which he was to attach facades, only considered: \"How will you give the greatest form to these dimensions? Some part of the detail must from the necessity of the case, be put out of its place or spoiled, and something unseemly is sure to arise here and there. Be that as it may, the whole will have a grand style, and you will be pleased with your work.\"\nAnd thus he carried out the great image which he had within his soul, just to the point where it was not quite suitable, and where he was obliged in the detail to mutilate or to overcrowd it.\nOn the other hand, the wing of the Carità cannot be too highly prized, for here the artist's hands were free, and he could follow the bent of his own mind without constraint. If the convent were finished there would, perhaps, be no work of architecture more perfect throughout the present world.\nHow he thought and how he worked becomes more and more clear to me, the more I read his works, and reflect how he treated the ancients; for he says few words, but they are all important. The fourth book, which illustrates the antique temples, is a good introduction to a judicious examination of ancient remains.\n\nOct. 6.\nYesterday evening I saw the Electra of Crebillon—that is to say, a translation—at the theatre S. Crisostomo. I cannot say, how absurd the piece appeared to me, and how terribly it tired me out.\nThe actors are generally good, and know how to put off the public with single passages.\nOrestes alone has three narratives, poetically set off, in one scene. Electra, a pretty little woman of the middle size and stature, with almost French vivacity, and with a good deportment, delivered the verses beautifully, only she acted the part madly from beginning to end, which, alas! it requires. However, I have again learned something. The Italian Iambic, which is invariably of eleven syllables, is very inconvenient for declamation, because the last syllable is always short, and causes an elevation of the voice against the will of the declaimer.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis morning I was present at high mass, which annually on this day the Doge must attend, in the church of St. Justina, to commemorate an old victory over the Turks. When the gilded barks, which carry the princes and a portion of the nobility approach the little square, when the boatmen, in their rare liveries, are plying their red-painted oars, when on the shore the clergy and the religious fraternities are standing, pushing, moving about, and waiting with their lighted torches fixed upon poles and portable silver chandeliers; then, when the gangways covered with carpet are placed from the vessels to the shore, and first the full violet dresses of the Savii, next the ample red robes of the Senators are unfolded upon the pavement, and lastly when the old Doge adorned with his golden Phrygian cap, in his long golden talar and his ermine cloak, steps out of the vessel—when all this, I say, takes place in a little square before the portal of a church, one feels as if one were looking at an old worked tapestry, exceedingly well designed and coloured. To me, northern fugitive as I am, this ceremony gave a great deal of pleasure. With us, who parade nothing but short coats in our processions of pomp, and who conceive nothing greater than one performed with shouldered arms, such an affair might be out of place. But these trains, these peaceful celebrations are all in keeping here.\nThe Doge is a well-grown and well-shaped man, who, perhaps, suffers from ill health, but, nevertheless, for dignity's sake, bears himself upright under his heavy robe. In other respects he looks like the grandpapa of the whole race, and is kind and affable. His dress is very becoming, the little cap, which he wears under the large one, does not offend the eye, resting as it does upon the whitest and finest hair in the world.\nAbout fifty nobili, with long dark-red trains, were with him. For the most part they were handsome men, and there was not a single uncouth figure among them. Several of them were tall with large heads, so that the white curly wigs were very becoming to them. Their features are prominent; the flesh of their faces is soft and white, without looking flabby and disagreeable. On the contrary, there is an appearance of talent without exertion, repose, self-confidence, easiness of existence, and a certain joyousness-pervades the whole.\nWhen all had taken their places in the church, and mass began, the fraternities entered by the chief door, and went out at the side door to the right, after they had received holy water in couples, and made their obeisance to the high altar, to the Doge, and the nobility.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis evening I bespoke the celebrated song of the mariners, who chaunt Tasso and Ariosto to melodies of their own. This must actually be ordered, as it is not to be beard as a thing, of course, but rather belongs to the half forgotten traditions of former times. I entered a gondola by moon-light, with one singer before and the other behind me. They sing their song taking up the verses alternately. The melody, which we know through Rousseau, is of a middle kind, between choral and recitative, maintaining throughout the same cadence, with out any fixed time. The modulation is also uniform, only varying with a sort of declamation both tone and measure, according to the subject of the verse. But the spirit—the life of it, is as follows:—\nWithout inquiring into the construction of the melody, suffice it to say that it is admirably suited to that easy class of people, who, always humming something or other to themselves, adapt such tunes to any little poem they know by heart.\nSitting on the shore of an island, on the bank of a canal, or on the side of a boat, a gondolier will sing away with a loud penetrating voice—the multitude admire force above everything—anxious only to be heard as far as possible. Over the silent mirror it travels far. Another in the distance, who is acquainted with the melody and knows the words, takes it up and answers with the next verse, and then the first replies, so that the one is as it were the echo of the other. The song continues through whole nights and is kept up without fatigue. The further the singers are from each other, the more touching sounds the strain. The best place for the listener is halfway between the two.\nIn order to let me hear it, they landed on the bank of the Guidecca, and took up different positions by the canal. I walked backwards and forwards between them, so as to leave the one whose turn it was to sing, and to join the one who had just left off. Then it was that the effect of the strain first opened upon me. As a voice from the distance it sounds in the highest degree strange—as a lament without sadness: it has an incredible effect and is moving even to tears. I ascribed this to my own state of mind, but my old boatsman said: \"è singolare, como quel canto intenerisce, e molto piu quando è piu ben cantato.\" He wished that I could hear the women of the Lido, especially those of Malamocco, and Pelestrina. These also, he told me, chanted Tasso and Ariosto to the same or similar melodies. He went on: \"in the evening, while their husbands are on the sea fishing, they are accustomed to sit on the beach, and with shrill-penetrating voice to make these strains resound, until they catch from the distance the voices of their partners, and in this way they keep up a communication with them.\" Is not that beautiful? and yet, it is very possible that one who heard them close by, would take little pleasure in such tones which have to vie with the waves of the sea. Human, however, and true becomes the song in this way: thus is life given to the melody, on whose dead elements we should otherwise have been sadly puzzled. It is the song of one solitary, singing at a distance, in the hope that another of kindred feelings and sentiments may hear and answer.\n\nVenice, Oct. 8, 1786.\nI paid a visit to the palace Pisani Moretta, for the sake of a charming picture by Paul Veronese. The females of the family of Darius are represented kneeling before Alexander and Hephæstion; his mother, who is in the foreground, mistakes Hephæstion for the king;—turning away from her he points to Alexander. A strange story is told about this painting; the artist had been well received and for a long time honorably entertained in the palace; in return he secretly painted the picture and left it behind him as a present, rolled up under his bed. Certainly it well deserves to have had a singular origin, for it gives an idea of all the peculiar merits of this master. The great art with which he manages by a skilful distribution of light and shade, and by an equally clever contrast of the local colors, to produce a most delightful harmony without throwing any sameness of tone over the whole picture, is here most strikingly visible. For the picture is in excellent preservation, and stands before us almost with the freshness of yesterday.—Indeed, whenever a painting of this order has suffered from neglect, our enjoyment of it is marred on the spot, even before we are conscious what the cause may be.\nWhoever feels disposed to quarrel with the artist on the score of costume has only to say he ought to have painted a scene of the sixteenth century; and the matter is at an end. The gradation in the expression from the mother through the wife to the daughters, is in the highest degree true and happy. The youngest princess, who kneels behind all the rest, is a beautiful girl, and has a very pretty, but somewhat independent and haughty countenance. Her position does not at all seem to please her.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nMy old gift of seeing the world with the eyes of that artist, whose pictures have most recently made an impression on me, has occasioned me some peculiar reflections. It is evident that the eye forms itself by the objects, which, from youth up, it is accustomed to look upon, and so the Venetian artist must see all things in a clearer and brighter light than other men. We, whose eye when out of doors, falls on a dingy soil, which, when not muddy, is dusty,—and which, always colourless, gives a sombre hue to the reflected rays, or at home spend our lives in close, narrow rooms, can never attain to such a cheerful view of nature.\nAs I floated down the lagunes in the full sunshine, and observed how the figures of the gondoliers in their motley costume, and as they rowed, lightly moving above the sides of the gondola, stood out from the bright green surface and against the blue sky, I caught the best and freshest type possible of the Venetian school. The sunshine brought out the local colours with dazzling brilliancy, and the shades even were so luminous, that, comparatively, they in their turn might serve as lights. And the same may be said of the reflection from the sea-green water. All was painted \"chiaro nell chiaro,\" so that foamy waves and lightning flashes were necessary to give it a grand finish (um die Tüpfchen auf sie zu setzen).\nTitian and Paul have this brilliancy in the highest degree, and whenever we do not find it in any of their works, the piece is either damaged or has been touched up.\nThe cupola and vaulting of St. Mark's, with its side-walls,—are covered with paintings—a mass of richly colored figures on a golden ground; all in mosaic work: some of them very good, others but poor, according to the masters who furnished the cartoons.\nCircumstances here have strangely impressed on my mind how everything depends on the first invention, and that this constitutes the right standard—the true genius—since with little square-pieces of glass (and here not in the soberest manner), it is possible to imitate the good as well as the bad. The art which furnished to the ancients their pavements, and to the Christians the vaulted ceilings of their churches, fritters itself away in our days on snuff-box lids and bracelets-clasps. The present times are worse even than one thinks.\n\nVenice, October 8, 1786.\nIn the Farsetti palace there is a valuable collection of casts from the best antiques. I pass over all such as I had seen before at Mannheim or elsewhere, and mention only new acquaintances. A Cleopatra in intense repose, with the asp coiled round her arm, and sinking into the sleep of death;—a Niobe shrouding with her robe her youngest daughter from the arrows of Apollo;—some gladiators;—a winged genius, resting in his flight;—some philosophers, both in sitting and standing postures.\nThey are works from which, for thousands of years to come, the world may receive delight and instruction, without ever being able to equal with their thanks the merits of the artists.\nMany speaking busts transported me to the old glorious times. Only I felt, alas, how backward I am in these studies; however, I will go on with them—at least I know the way. Palladio has opened the road for me to this and every other art and life. That sounds probably somewhat strange, and yet not so paradoxical as when Jacob Böhme says that, by seeing a pewter platter by a ray from Jupiter, he was enlightened as to the whole universe. There is also in this collection a fragment of the entablature of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina in Rome.\nThe bold front of this noble piece of architecture reminded me of the capitol of the Pantheon at Mannheim. It is, indeed, something very different from our queer saints, piled up one above the other on little consoles after the gothic style of decoration,—something different from our tobacco-pipe-like shafts,—our little steeple-crowned towers, and foliated terminals,—from all taste for these—I am now, thank God, set free for ever!\nI will further mention a few works of statuary, which, as I passed along these last few days, I have observed with astonishment and instruction: before the gate of the arsenal two huge lions of white marble,-the one is half recumbent, raising himself up on his fore-feet,—the other is lying down: noble emblems of the variety of life. They are of such huge proportions, that all around appears little, and man himself would become as nought, did not sublime objects elevate him. They are of the best times of Greece, and were brought here from the Piraeus in the better days of the Republic.\nFrom Athens, too, in all probability, came two bas-reliefs which have been introduced in the church of St. Justina, the conqueress of the Turks. Unfortunately they are in some degree hidden by the church seats. The sacristan called my attention to them on account of the tradition that Titian, modelled from them the beautiful angel in his picture of the martyrdom of St. Peter. The relievos represent genii who are decking themselves out with, the attributes of the gods,—so beautiful in truth, as to transcend all idea or conception.\nNext I contemplated with quite peculiar feelings the naked colossal statue of Marcus Agrippa, in the court of a palace; a dolphin which is twisting itself by his side, points out the naval hero. How does such a heroic representation make the mere man equal to the gods!\nI took a close view of the horses of S. Mark's. Looking up at them from below, it is easy to see that they are spotted: in places they exhibit a beautiful yellow-metallic lustre, in others a coppery green has run over them. Viewing them more closely, one sees distinctly that once they were gilt all over, and long streaks are still to be seen over them, as the barbarians did not attempt to file off the gold, but tried to cut it off. That, too, is well: thus the shape at least has been preserved.\nA glorious team of horses,—I should like to hear the opinion of a good judge of horse-flesh. What seemed strange to me was, that closely viewed, they appear heavy, while from the piazza below they look as light as deer.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nYesterday I set out early with my tutelary genius for the \"Lido,\" the tongue of land which shuts in the lagunes, and divides them from the sea. We landed and walked straight across the isthmus. I heard a loud hollow murmur,—it was the sea! I soon saw it: it crested high against the shore, as it retired,—it was about noon, and time of ebb. I have then at last seen the sea with my own eyes, and followed it on its beautiful bed, just as it quitted it. I wished the children had been there to gather the shells; child-like I myself picked up plenty of them; however, I attempted to make them useful; I tried to dry in them some of the fluid of the cuttle fish, which here dart away from you in shoals.\nOn the \"Lido,\" not far from the sea, is the burial place of Englishmen, and a little further on, of the Jews: both alike are refused the privilege of resting in consecrated ground. I found here the tomb of Smith, the noble English consul, and of his first wife. It is to him that I owe my first copy of Palladio; I thanked him for it here in his unconsecrated grave. And not only unconsecrated, but half buried is the tomb. The \"Lido\" is at best but a sand-bank (daune): The sand is carried from it backwards and forwards by the wind, and thrown up in heaps is encroaching on every side. In a short time the monument, which is tolerably high, will no longer be visible.\nBut the sea—it is a grand sight! I will try and get a sail upon it some day in a fishing-boat: the gondolas never venture out so far.\n\nOct. 8, 1786.\nOn the sea-coast I found also several plants, whose characters similar to others I already knew, enabled me to recognize pretty well their properties. They are all alike, fat and strong-full of sap and clammy,—and it is evident that the old salt of the sandy soil, but still more the saline atmosphere, gives them these properties. Like aquatic plants they abound in sap, and are fleshy and tough, like mountainous ones; those whose leaves shew a tendency to put forth prickles, after the manner of thistles, have them extremely sharp and strong. I found a bush with leaves of this kind. It looked very much like our harmless coltsfoot, only here it is armed with sharp weapons,—the leaves like leather, as also are the seed-vessels, and the stalk very thick and succulent. I bring with me seeds and specimens of the leaves. (Eryngium maritimum.)\nThe fish-market, with its numberless marine productions, afforded me much amusement. I often go there to contemplate the poor captive inhabitants of the sea.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nA delicious day from morning to night! I have been towards Chiozza, as far as Pelestrina, where are the great structures, called Murazzi, which the Republic has caused to be raised against the sea. They are of hewn stone, and properly are intended to protect from the fury of the wild element the tongue of land called the Lido, which separates the lagoons from the sea.\nThe lagunes are the work of old nature. First of all, the land and tide, the ebb and flow, working against one another, and then the gradual sinking of the primal waters, were, together, the causes why, at the upper end of the Adriatic, we find a pretty extensive range of marshes, which, covered by the flood-tide, are partly left bare by the ebb. Art took possession of the highest spots, and thus arose Venice, formed out of a groupe of a hundred isles, and surrounded by hundreds more. Moreover, at an incredible expense of money and labour, deep canals have been dug through the marshes, in order that at the time of high water, ships of war might pass to the chief points. What human industry and wit contrived and executed of old, skill and industry must now keep up. The Lido, a long narrow strip of land, separates the lagunes from the sea, which can enter only at two points—at the castle and at the opposite end near Chiozza. The tide flows in usually twice a-day, and with the ebb again carries out the waters twice, and always by the same channel and in the same direction. The flood covers the lower parts of the morass, but leaves the higher, if not dry, yet visible.\nThe case would be quite altered were the sea to make new ways for itself, to attack the tongue of land and flow in and out wherever it chose. Not to mention that the little villages on the Lido, Pelestrina, viz., S. Peter's and others would be overwhelmed, the canals of communication would be choked up, and while the water involved all in ruin, the Lido would be changed into an island, and the islands which now lie behind it be converted into necks and tongues of land. To guard against this it was necessary to protect the Lido as far as possible, lest the furious element should capriciously attack and overthrow what man had already taken possession of, and with a certain end and purpose given shape and use to.\nIn extraordinary cases when the sea rises above measure, it is especially necessary to prevent it entering at more than two points. Accordingly the rest of the sluice-gates being shut, with all its violence it is unable to enter, and in a few hours submits to the law of the ebb, and its fury lessens.\nOtherwise Venice has nothing to fear; the extreme slowness with which the sea-line retires, assures to her thousands of years yet, and by prudently deepening the canals from time to time, they will easily maintain their possessions against the inroads of the water.\nI could only wish that they kept their streets a little cleaner—a duty which is as necessary as it is easy of performance, and which in fact becomes of great consequence in the course of centuries. Even now in the principal thoroughfares it is forbidden to throw anything into the canals: the sweepings even of the streets may not be cast into them. No measures, however, are taken to prevent the rain, which here falls in sudden and violent torrents, from carrying off the dirt which is collected in piles at the corner of every street, and washing it into the lagunes—nay, what is still worse, into the gutters for carrying off the water, which consequently are often so completely stopped up, that the principal squares are in danger of being under water. Even in the smaller piazza of S. Mark's, I have seen the gullies which are well laid down there, as well as in the greater square, choked up and full of water.\nWhen a rainy day comes, the filth is intolerable; every one is cursing and scolding. In ascending and descending the bridges one soils one's mantle and great coat (Tabarro), which is here worn all the year long, and as one goes along in shoes and silk stockings, one gets splashed, and then scolds, for it is not common mud, but mud that adheres and stains that one is here splashed with. The weather soon becomes fine again, and then no one thinks of cleaning the streets. How true is the saying: the public is ever complaining that is ill served, and never knows how to set about getting better served. Here if the sovereign-people wished it, it might be done forthwith.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nYesterday evening I ascended the tower of S. Mark's: as I had lately seen from its top the lagunes in their glory at flood time, I wished also to see them at low water; for in order to have a correct idea of the place, it is necessary to take in both views. It looks rather strange to see land all around one, where a little before the eye fell upon a mirror of waters. The islands are no longer islands—merely higher and house-crowned spots in one large morass of a gray-greenish colour, and intersected by beautiful canals. The marshy parts are overgrown with aquatic plants, a circumstance which must tend in time to raise their level, although the ebb and flow are continually shaking and tossing them and leave no rest to the vegetation.\nI now turn with my narrative once more to the sea.—I there saw yesterday the haunts of the sea-snails, the limpets, and the crab, and was highly delighted with the sight. What a precious glorious object is a living thing!—how wonderfully adapted to its state of existence, how true, how real (seyend). What great advantages do I not derive now from my former studies of nature, and how delighted am I with the opportunity of continuing them! But as the present is a matter that admits of being communicated to my friends, I will not seek to excite their sympathy merely by exclamations.\nThe stone-works which have been built against the inroads of the sea consist first of all of several steep steps; then comes a slightly inclined plane, then again they rise a step, which is once more succeeded by a gently ascending surface, and last of all comes a perpendicular wall with an overhanging coping—over these steps—over these planes the raging sea rises until in extraordinary cases it even dashes over the highest wall with its projecting head.\nThe sea is followed by its inhabitants;—little periwinkles good to eat, monovalve limpets, and whatever else has the power of motion, especially by the pungar-crabs. But scarcely have these little creatures taken possession of the smooth walls, ere the sea retires again, swelling and cresting as it came. At first the crowd knows not where they are, and keep hoping that the briny flood will soon return to them—but it still keeps away; the sun comes out and quickly dries them up, and now begins the retreat. It is on these occasions that the pungars seek their prey. Nothing more wonderful or comical can be seen than the manœuvres of these little creatures, with their round bodies and two long claws (for the other spider-feet are scarcely worth noticing). On these stilted fore-legs, as it were, they stride along watching the limpets, and as soon as one moves itself under its shell on the rock, a pungar comes up and inserting the point of his claw in the tiny interstice between the shell and the rock turns it over, and so manages to swallow the oyster. The limpets, on the other hand, proceed cautiously on their way, and by suction fasten themselves firmly to the rocky surface as soon as they are aware of the proximity of their foe. In such cases the pungar deports himself amusingly enough; round and round the pulpy animal who keeps himself safe beneath his roof will he go with singular politeness; but not succeeding with all his coaxing and being unable to overcome its powerful muscle, he leaves in despair this intended victim, and hastens after another who may be wandering less cautiously on his way.\nI never saw a crab succeed in his designs, although I have watched for hours the retreat of the little troop as they crawled down the two planes and the intermediate steps.\n\nVenice, Oct. 10, 1786.\nAt last I am able to say that I have seen a comedy; Yesterday at the theatre of St. Luke, was performed \"Le Baruffe-Chiozotte,\" which I should interpret the Frays and Feuds of Chiozza. The \"dramatis personæ,\" are principally seafaring people, inhabitants of Chiozza, with their wives, sisters, and daughters. The usual noisy demonstrations of such sort of people in their good or ill luck—their dealings one with another, their vehemence, but goodness of heart, common-place remarks and unaffected manners, their naïve wit and humour—all this was excellently imitated. The piece, moreover, is Goldoni's, and as I had been only the day before in the place itself, and as the tones and manners of the sailors and people of the sea-port still echoed in my ears and floated before my eyes, it delighted me very much, and although I did not understand a single allusion, I was, nevertheless, on the whole, able to follow it pretty well. I will now give you the plan of the piece:—it opens with the females of Chiozza sitting, as usual, on the strand before their cabins, spinning, mending nets, sewing, or making lace; a youth passes by and notices one of them with a more friendly greeting than the rest. Immediately the joking begins—and observes no bounds; becoming tarter and tarter, and growing ill-tempered it soon bursts out into reproaches; abuse vies with abuse; in the midst of all one dame more vehement than the rest, bounces out with the truth; and now an endless din of scolding, railing, and screaming; there is no lack of more decided outrage, and at last the peace-officers are compelled to interfere.\nThe second act opens with the Court of Justice. In the absence of the Podestà (who as a noble could not lawfully be brought upon the stage) the Actuarius presides. He orders the women to be brought before him one by one. This gives rise to an interesting scene. It happens that this official personage is himself enamoured of the first of the combatants who is brought before him. Only too happy to have an opportunity of speaking with her alone, instead of hearing what she has to say on the matter in question, he makes her a declaration of love. In the midst of it a second woman, who is herself in love with the actuary, in a fit of jealousy rushes in, and with her the suspicious lover of the first damsel—who is followed by all the rest, and now the same demon of confusion riots in the court as a little before, had set at loggerheads the people of the harbour. In the third act the fun gets more and more boisterous, and the whole ends with a hasty and poor denouement. The happiest thought, however, of the whole piece, is a character who is thus drawn,—an old sailor who from the hardships he has been exposed to from his childhood, trembles and falters in all his limbs, and even in his very organs of speech, is brought on the scene to serve as a foil to this restless, screaming, and jabbering crew. Before he can utter a word, he has to make a long preparation by a slow twitching of his lips, and an assistant motion of his hands and arms; at last he blurts out what his thoughts are on the matter in dispute. But as he can only manage to do this in very short sentences, he acquires thereby a sort of laconic gravity, so that all he utters sounds like an adage or maxim; and in this way a happy contrast is afforded to the wild and passionate exclamations of the other personages.\nBut even as it was, I never witnessed anything like the noisy delight the people evinced at seeing themselves and their mates represented with such truth of nature. It was one continued laugh and tumultuous shout of exultation from beginning to end. I must, however, confess that the piece was extremely well acted by the players. According to the cast of their several parts, they had adopted among them the different tones of voice which usually prevail among the inhabitants of the place. The first actress was the universal favorite, more so even than she had recently been in an heroic dress and a scene of passion. The female players generally, but especially this one, in the most pleasing manner possible imitated the twang, the manners, and other peculiarities of the people they represented. Great praise is due to the author, who out of nothing has here created the most amusing divertissement. However, he never could have done it with any other people than his own merry and lighthearted countrymen. The farce is written throughout with a practised hand.\nOf Sacchi's company, for whom Gozzi wrote (but which by-the-by is now broken up), I saw Smeraldina, a short plump figure, full of life, tact, and good humour. With her I saw Brighella—a slight well-made man and an excellent actor, especially in pantomime. These masks which we scarcely know except in the form of mummings, and which to our minds possess neither life nor meaning, succeed here only too well as the creation of the national taste. Here the most distinguished characters, persons of every age and condition, think nothing of dressing themselves out in the strangest costumes, and as for the greater part of the year they are accustomed to wander about in masks, they feel no surprise at seeing the black visors on the stage also.\n\nVenice, October 11, 1786.\nSince solitude, in the midst of a great crowd of human beings, is after all not possible, I have taken up with an old Frenchman, who knows nothing of Italian, and suspects that he is cheated on all hands and taken advantage of, and who, with plenty of letters of recommendation, nevertheless, does not make his way with the good people here. A man of rank, and living in good style, but one whose mind cannot go beyond himself and his own immediate circle—he is perhaps full fifty, and has at home a boy seven years old, of whom he is always anxious to get news. He is travelling through Italy for pleasure, but rapidly—in order to be able to say that he has seen it, but is willing to learn whatever is possible as he hurries along. I have shewn him some civilities, and have given him information about many matters. While I was speaking to him about Venice, he asked me how long I had been here, and when he heard that this was my first visit, and that I had only been here fourteen days, he replied: \"Il paraît que vous n'avez pas perdu votre temps.\" This is the first \"testimonium\" of my good behaviour that I can furnish you. This is the eighth day since he arrived here, and he leaves us to-morrow. It was highly delicious to me, to meet in a strange land with such a regular Versailles'-man. He is now about to quit me! It caused me some surprise to think that any one could ever travel in this temper without a thought for anything beyond himself, and yet he is in his way a polished, sensible, and well conducted person.\n\nVenice, Oct. 12, 1786.\nYesterday at S. Luke's a new piece was acted:—L'Inglicismo in Italia (the English in Italy). As there are many Englishmen living in Italy, it is not unnatural that their ways and habits should excite notice, and I expected to learn from this piece what the Italians thought of their rich and welcome visitors. But it was a total failure. There were, of course, (as is always the case here,) some clever scenes between buffoons, but the rest was cast altogether in too grave and heavy a mould, and yet nob a trace of the English good sense: plenty of the ordinary Italian commonplaces of morality, and those, too, upon the very commonest of topics.\nAnd it did not take: indeed, it was on the very point of being hissed off the stage. The actors felt themselves out of their element—not on the strand of Chiozza. As this was the last piece that I saw here, my enthusiasm for these national representations did not seem likely to be increased by this piece of folly.\nAs I have at last gone through my journal and entered some occasional remarks from my tablets, my proceedings are now enrolled and left to the sentence of my friends. There is, I am conscious, very much in these leaves which I might qualify, enlarge upon, and improve. Let, however, what is written, stand as the memorial of first impressions, which, if not always correct, will nevertheless be ever dear and precious to me. Oh that I could but transmit to my friends a breath merely of this light existence! Verily to the Italian, \"ultramontane\" is a very vague idea; and to me even—\"beyond the Alps,\" rises very obscurely before my mind, although from out of their mists friendly forms are beckoning to me. It is the climate only that seduces me to prefer awhile these lands to those; for birth and habit forge strong fetters. Here, however, I could not live, nor indeed in any place where I had nothing to occupy my mind; but at present novelty furnishes me here with endless occupation. Architecture rises, like an ancient spirit from the tombs, and bids me study its laws just as people do the rules of a dead language, not in order to practise or to take a living joy in them, but only in order to enable myself in the quiet depths of my own mind to do honor to her existence in bygone ages, and her for ever departed glory. As Palladio everywhere refers one to Vitruvius, I have bought an edition of the latter by Galiani; but this folio suffers in my portmanteau as much as my brain does in the study of it. Palladio by his words and works, by his method and way, both of thinking and of executing, has brought Vitruvius home to me and interpreted him far better than the Italian translator ever can. Vitruvius himself is no easy reading; his book is obscurely written, and requires a critical study. Notwithstanding I have read it through cursorily, and it has left on my mind many a glorious impression. To express my meaning better: I read it like a breviary: more out of devotion, than for instruction. Already the days begin to draw in and allow more time for reading and writing.\nGod be praised! whatever from my youth up appeared to me of worth, is beginning once more to be dear to me. How happy do I feel that I can again venture to approach the ancient authors. For now, I may dare tell it—and confess at once my disease and my folly. For many a long year I could not bear to look at a Latin author, or to cast my eye upon anything that might serve to awaken in my mind the thoughts of Italy. If by accident I did so, I suffered the most horrible tortures of mind. It was a frequent joke of Herder's at my expense, that I had learned all my Latin from Spinoza, for he had noticed that this was the only Latin work I ever read; but he was not aware how carefully I was obliged to keep myself from the ancients—how even these abstruse generalities were but cursorily read by me, and even then not without pain. At last matters came to that pitch that even the perusal of Wieland's translation of the Satires made me utterly wretched; scarcely had I read two of them, before I was compelled to lay the book aside.\nHad I not made the resolve, which I am now carrying into effect, I should have been altogether lost—to such a degree of intensity had the desire grown to see these objects with my own eyes. Historical acquaintance with them did me no good;—the things stood only a hand's-breadth away from me; but still they were separated from me by an impenetrable wall. And, in fact, at the present moment, I somehow feel as if this were not the first time that I had seen these things, but as if I were paying a second visit to them. Although I have been but a short time in Venice, I have adapted myself pretty well to the ways of the place, and feel confident that I shall carry away with me, though a very incomplete, yet, nevertheless, clear and true idea of it.\n\nVenice, Oct. 14, 1786. 2 o'clock, morning.\nIn the last moments of my stay here: for I am to start almost immediately with the packet-boat for Ferrara. I quit Venice without reluctance; for to stay here longer with any satisfaction and profit to myself, I must take other steps which would carry me beyond my present plan. Besides everybody is now leaving this city and making for the beautiful gardens and seats on the Terra-Firma; I, however, go away well-loaded, and shall carry along with me its rich, rare, and unique image.",

      "content": "Simulation Data Sheet: The Great Council of Venice (1740)\n\n\nDocument Objective\n\nThis document serves as a knowledge base for a text-based simulation (LLM). It details the mechanics, atmosphere, and procedures of the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council) in 1740, based on the institutional analysis of Amelot de La Houssaye and historical data regarding the daily life of the Republic.\n\n1. The Space: La Sala del Maggior Consiglio\n\nFor the simulation, the space acts as a constraining environment that dictates movement and social interaction.\n\nArchitecture and Symbolism\n\nDimensions: A massive hall (53m x 25m) free of supporting columns, capable of holding between 1,000 and 2,000 patricians.\nThe Ceiling: Heavy with gold leaf and paintings (notably Veronese’s The Triumph of Venice). It serves as a constant reminder of the divine and state hierarchy.\nThe East Wall (Il Paradiso): Dominated by Tintoretto’s immense canvas, located above the Signoria's tribune. By 1740, the painting had darkened with time, creating a severe backdrop behind the Doge.\nThe Tribune (La Signoria): A raised platform where the Doge, his six counselors, and the three chiefs of the Quarantia sit. They physically overlook the assembly.\nThe Benches (Banchi): Arranged in double rows parallel to the walls, leaving a vast central aisle empty for voting procedures.1\n\nAnnexed Spaces (Crucial for Intrigue)\n\nThe Liagò: A closed loggia or terrace adjacent to the hall. It is a \"decompression\" zone where nobles withdraw to speak freely, negotiate votes away from the Signoria’s gaze, or escape the stifling air of the main hall.2\nThe Sala dello Scrutinio: An adjacent hall often used for counting votes or secondary balloting procedures.3\n\nSensory Atmosphere\n\nAcoustics: The sheer volume of the hall and the number of participants create a constant background hum (buzzing). Official readings by the Chancellor are often inaudible to those seated at the far ends.\nLight and Temperature: The hall is lit by large windows facing the lagoon. In winter, it is notoriously freezing (nobles keep their fur-lined cloaks on). In summer, the heat and the proximity of bodies make the air oppressive.4\n\n2. The Actors: Patrician Sociology (1740)\n\nThe simulation must distinguish between three classes of nobles, who are legally equal but economically and politically divided.\n\nThe Three Classes\n\nThe \"Case Vecchie\" and the Rich: Historic families or immense new fortunes. They monopolize high executive offices (Savi, Council of Ten, Ambassadors). They use the Great Council to validate their power, though real decisions are made in the Senate.5\nThe Middle Nobility: They aim for judicial (Quarantie) and administrative offices. They are often legalistic and attached to procedure.\nThe Barnabotti (The Noble Plebs):\nDefinition: Impoverished nobles, often living in the parish of San Barnaba. They have lost their fortunes but retain their vote in the Council.6\nRole in Simulation: They constitute an electoral maneuver mass. Barred from trade and manual labor, their only \"commodity\" is their vote. They are known to be unruly and to sell their suffrage in exchange for informal gratuities (protection, loans, meals).7\n\nCostume (Visual Code)\n\nThe Vesta (Toga): Mandatory for all. A long black gown with large sleeves (a comito). In winter, it is lined with fur; in summer, it is made of light silk.9\nThe Stola (Stole): A band of black cloth worn over the left shoulder. Its width and lining indicate rank (ordinary for a simple noble, wide and fur-lined for Senators and Councilors).10\nThe Wig: By 1740, the use of the powdered wig is generalized, creating an anachronistic contrast between the medieval costume (toga) and the Rococo hairstyle. High, voluminous wigs are a sign of fashion and wealth.\n\n3. The Political Ritual\n\n\nBefore the Session: The Broglio\n\nLocation: The Piazzetta San Marco, before the bell rings.\nAction: This is the time for electoral solicitation. Candidates (\"solicitors\") stand on one side, electors on the other.12\nGestures: Open campaigning is forbidden by law. Everything occurs through codes of exaggerated politeness: deep bows, kissing of the sleeve or stole, and whispered requests for support (\"Mi raccomando\").12\nThe Trottiera: The specific bell that announces the imminent start of the session, urging latecomers to hasten to the palace.4\n\nDuring the Session: Voting and Chance\n\nThe Venetian system, detailed by Amelot de La Houssaye, relies on a complex mix of Sortition (to prevent factions) and Election (to ensure competence).\n\nThe Tools\n\nThe Ballottino: A boy aged 8 to 10, often dressed in white, tasked with drawing balls from the urns to guarantee the innocence of chance.3\nThe Bussole (Urns): Wooden structures allowing for secret voting. The noble inserts his hand and drops his ball into a hidden tube (the \"Yes\" tube or \"No\" tube).\nThe Balls (Balote): Small balls made of compressed linen (for silence).\nGold: Winning ball (for sortition).\nSilver: Losing ball.\nWhite / Red (or Green): Used for voting \"Yes\" or \"No\" during legislative or judicial scrutinies.3\n\nThe \"Four Hands\" Procedure (Election of Magistrates)\n\nThis is the standard procedure for electing state officials.14\nThe Sortition: Each noble passes before an urn. The Ballottino draws a ball for him. If he gets a Gold ball, he becomes an Elector. This continues until 36 electors are chosen.14\nThe Division: The 36 electors are isolated and divided into 4 groups of 9, called \"Hands\" (Mani).\nThe Nomination (Secret): Each \"Hand,\" isolated in a separate room, must agree (by a majority of 6 out of 9) to propose one candidate for the vacant post.\nThe General Ballot: The 4 names proposed (one by each \"Hand\") are announced to the Great Council. The entire assembly then votes for or against each candidate. The one with the most votes wins.14\n\n4. Simulation Data Cards\n\n\nCard A: Sequence of Actions (Sunday Routine)\n\n10:00 AM - Broglio: Social interaction on the Piazza. Informal negotiations.\n10:30 AM - Trottiera: Sound signal. Crowd movement towards the Giants' Staircase.\n11:00 AM - Installation: Entry into the hall. Barnabotti seek strategic seats or cluster together.\n11:30 AM - Reading: The Chancellor reads the list of vacant posts. Ambient hubbub.\n12:00 PM - Lottery (Ballottino): Slow procession before the urn. Tension of the Gold/Silver draw.\n1:00 PM - Conclave of the 4 Hands: Session suspension for the 36 electors. Others wait, chat in the Liagò.\n2:00 PM - Final Vote: Procession to the Bussole to validate candidates.\n\nCard B: Tension Variables\n\nThese modifiers can be used to generate incidents or intrigues in the simulation.\nCold/Heat: Impatience factor. Can push nobles to rush a vote or leave the session early (if the quorum is not threatened).\nVote Selling: A player may be approached by an agent of a rich family: \"A dinner invitation in exchange for a white ball for candidate Cornaro.\"6\nProcedural Error: If the Ballottino makes a mistake or an urn is improperly closed, the Quarantie (judges) must intervene, creating a dramatic interruption.\n\n5.

Ainsi, sur le bruit\nqui courait de ce que dessus, j'allais sans doute\nme gendarmer bien fort ; mais à la vue de votre\nlettre,\nSeigneur je Tai jugé trop peu digne de foi.\nDe sorte que j'ai rengainé bien vite ce qui m'ani-\nmait contre le journal, et qui n'allait pas moins qu'à\nsupprimer, si j'eusse pu, ce gros in-4% que vous\navez reçu en dernier lieu, et tous ceux qui auraient\ndû lui succéder; ce qui faisait, pour vous parler\n• vrai, le sujet de mon ire, c'était de ne point recevoir\nde vos nouvelles; partant, je me suis trouvé coi\nquand j'ai été convaincu de votre exactitude. Il faut\npourtant là-dessus que je vous en croie sur votre\nparole, car je n'ai reçu que votre dernière lettre.\nCelle que vous m'écriviez à Rome n'est pas encore\narrivée. J'espère cependant qu'elle ne sera pas per-\ndue, non plus que d'autres que j'ai reçues par la\nmême voie, et je l'attends avec impatience, dans\nl'espérance d'y trouver des histoires divines.\nIl me semble que je vous devrais au moins autant\nde compliments sur vos réflexions morales que vous\nm'en faites sur mon babil. Vous parlez en homme\npénétré de l'une et de l'autre situation, et cela est\ndans l'ordre; mais votre comparaison, bien qu'ingé-\n*nieuse, n'est pas tout à fait juste. Les récits sont plus exacts à peindre le bien et le mal, que ne le\nsont les relations de voyages.

Ainsi, non contents d'exalter des gredi-\nneries, ils passent sous silence tout ce qu'il leur en\na coûté pour jouir des choses vraiment curieuses; de\nsorte qu'un pauvre lecteur, n'imaginant que roses\net que fleurs dans le voyage qu'il va entreprendre,\ntrouve souvent à décompter, et se voit précisément\ndans le cas d'un homme qui serait devenu amoureux\nd'une femme borgne, sur son portrait peint de pro-\nfil.

Le résul-\ntat de tout cela, c'est qu'il faut payer la poste ex-\ncessivement cher, et compter toujours, quand on a\ndestmé une certaine somme à ce voyage-ci, qu'on\ndépensera le triple, encore que notre argent gagne\nen Italie; car, outre Tarticle de la poste et des voitu-\nrins qui sont d'abominables canailles, il y a celui des\nauberges plus chères qu'en France, quoiqu'on ne\nsoupe jamais, et celui que l'on appelle la hiiona man-\ncia, comme nous dirions la bonne main. Ce point ne\nfinit pas ; pour la plus petite chose vous êtes entouré\nde gens qui vous demandent pour boire ; même un\nhomme avec qui on a fait un marché d'un louis trou-\nverait fort singulier, après Fexécution, qu'on ne lui\ndonnât qu'un écu de bonne main. Je m'en plains\n' tous les jours aux gens du pays, qui se contentent de\nplier les épaules en disant : Poveri forestieri c'est-\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 167\nà-dire en langue vulgaire, les étrangers sont faits\npour être volés. Quand j'aurai un peu plus de pra-\ntique de la langue du pays, je mettrai bon ordre à\nce que cela n'arrive plus. Enfin, je ne finirais pas,\nsi je voulais blâmer toutes les erreurs où Ton est sur\nce voyage, et qui ne sont pas mieux fondées que la\njalousie des Italiens, ou la captivité de leurs femmes ;\nmais cette préface n'est déjà que trop longue. Re-\ntournons à nos moutons, c'est-à-dire à notre journal,\nà condition cependant que vous ne le communique-\nrez qu'à peu de personnes ; quand ce seront des gens\ndiscrets comme Bourbonne ou Courtois; mais je\ndéfends les causeurs, à commencer par votre frère.\nJe ne sais si je vous ai conté comment nous par-\ntîmes de Padoue , le 28 du mois dernier. Ce fut eii\nnous embarquant sur le canal de la Brenta, avec lin\nvent contraire; c'est la règle. Mais pour le coup, le\ndiable en fut la dupe, car nous avions de bons che-\nvaux qui nous remorquaient le long du bord, moyen-\nnant quoi nous ingannions le sortilège qui nous\npoursuit. Le bâtiment que nous montions se nomme\nle Bucentaure. Vous pouvez bien penser que ce n'est\nqu'un fort petit enfant du vrai Bucentaure; mais\naussi c'était le plus joli enfant du monde, ressem-\nblant fort en beau à nos diligences d'eau, et infini-\nment plus propre, composé d'une petite antichambre\npour les valets, suivie d'une chambre tapissée de\nbrocatelle de Venise, avec une table et deux estrades\ngarnies de maroquin et ouverte de huit croisées\neffectives et de deux portes vitrées. Nous trouvions\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nm XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY,\nnotre domicile si agréable et si commode, que,\ncontre notre ordinaire, nous n'avions nulle impa-\n• tience d'arriver, d'autant mieux que nous nous étions\nmunis de force vivres, vin de Canarie, etc. ; et que\nles rivages sont bordés de quantité de belles maisons\nde nobles vénitiens. Celle de Pisani, maintenant\ndoge, mérite en vérité une description particulière ,\nsurtout par un portail de jardin au bord de l'eau\naccompagné de deux colonnes qui ont des escaliers\ntournants de fer en dehors, montant sur une terrasse\ncharmante, qui fait le comble du péristyle. Cela est\nimaginé à merveille, et l'on m'a dit depuis que le\ncardinal de Rohan en avait fait prendre le dessin\npour l'exécuter à Saverne. Nous voulions d'abord\ndescendre pour voir ces maisons; le nombre nous\nen rebuta : c'aurait été l'affaire de quelques années.\nCependant nous ne résistâmes pas à la tentation de\nvoir la dernière, qui est sur la route, appartenant\naux Foscarini ; elle a beaucoup de bonnes fresques,\net surtout une Chute des Titans, d'une excellente ex-\npression, de la main de Zelotti. (Notez cependant\nque ceci est encore inférieur aux abords de Gênes.)\nAu bout de quelques milles nous eûmes l'honneur\nd'entrer dans la mer Adriatique , et peu après celui\nd'apercevoir Venise.\nA vous dire vrai , l'abord de cette ville ne me sur-\nprit pas autant que je m'y attendais. Cela ne me fit\npas un autre effet que la vue d'une place située au\nbord de la mer, et Tentrée par le Grand-Canal fut,\nà mon gré, celle de Lyon ou de Paris, par la rivière,\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 169\nMais aussi quand on y est une fois, qu'on voit sortir\nde l'eau de tous côtés des palais, des églises, des\nrues, des villes entières, car il n'y en a pas pour une;\nenfin, de ne pouvoir faire un pas par une ville sans\navoir le pied dans la mer, c'est une chose à mon gré\nsi surprenante, qu'aujourd'hui j'y suis moins fait que\nle premier jour, aussi bien qu'à voir cette ville\nouverte de tous côtés, sans portes, sans fortifications\net sans un seul soldat de garnison, imprenable par\nmer ainsi que parterre; car les vaisseaux de guerre\nn'en peuvent nullement approcher , à cause des la-\ngunes trop basses pour les porter. En un mot, cette\nville-ci est si singulière par sa disposition, ses façons,\nses manières de vivre à faire crever de rire , la li-\nberté qui y règne et la tranquillité qu'on y goûte ,\nque je n'hésite pas à la regarder comme la seconde\nville de l'Europe, et je doute que Rome me fasse re- venir de ce sentiment.\nNous sommes logés, pour ainsi dire, dans le fort\nde la rue Saint-Honoré ; avec cela on peut dormir la\ngrasse matinée sans être interrompu par le moindre\nbruit. Tout s'y passe doucement dans l'eau , et je\ncrois que l'on ronflerait fort bien au milieu du mar-\nché aux herbes. Joignez à cela qu'il n'y a pas dans\nle monde une voiture comparable aux gondoles pour\nla commodité et l'agrément. Je ne trouve pas que\nl'on en ait donné à mon gré une description juste.\nC'est un bâtiment long et étroit comme un poisson ,\nà peu près comme un requin ; au milieu est posée\nune espèce de caisse de carrosse, basse, faite en ber-\n1. . 10\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\n170 XIV.— A M.

Il y a place pour deux dans le fond , et pour\ndeux autres de chaque côté sur une banquette qui y\nrègne , mais qui ne sert presque jamais que pour\nétendre les pieds de ceux qui sont dans le fond. Tout\ncela est ouvert de trois côtés , comme nos carrosses ,\net se ferme quand on veut , soit par des glaces , soit\npar des panneaux de bois recouverts de drap noir ,\nqu'on fait glisser sur des coulisses, ou rentrer par le\ncôté dans le corps de la gondole. Je ne sais pas trop\nsi je me fais entendre. Le bec d'avant de la gondole\nest armé d'un grand fer en col de grue, garni de six\nlarges dents de fer. Cela sert à la tenir en équilibre,\net je compare ce bc à la gueule ouverte du requin,\nbien que cela y ressemble comme à un moulin à\nveut. Tout le bateau est peint en noir et verni ; la\ncaisse doublée de velours noir en dedans et de drap\nnoir en dehors , avec les coussins de maroquin de\nmême couleur, sans qu'il soit permis aux plus grands\nseigneurs d'en avoir une différente, en quoi que ce\nsoit, de celle du plus petit particulier ; de sorte qu'il\nne faut pas songer à deviner qui peut être dans une\ngondole fermée. On est là comme dans sa chambre,\nà lire, écrire, converser, caresser sa maltresse, man--\nger, boire, etc., toujours faisant des visites par la\nville. Deux hommes , d'une fidélité à toute épreuve,\nl'un à l'avant, l'autre à l'arrière, vous conduisent\nsans vous voir, si vous ne voulez.\nJe n'espère plus de me retrouver de sang-froid\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 171\ndans un carrosse, après avoir tkié de ceci. J'avais\nouï dire qu'il n'y avait jamais d'embarras de gon-\ndoles , comme il y en a de voitures à Paris ; mais au\ncontraire rien n'est plus commun , surtout dans les\nrues étroites et sous les ponts ; à la vérité ils sont de\npeu de durée, la flexibilité de l'eau donne une\ngrande facilité pour s'en débarrasser. Outre cela, nos\ncochers d'ici sont si adroits, qu'ils glissent on ne sait\ncomfnent, et tournent en un coup de main cette lon-\ngissime machine , sur la pointe d'une aiguille. Ces\nvoitures vont vite , mais non pas autant que le car-\nrosse d'un petit maître. Cependant ne vous avisez\npas de tenir la tète hors de votre gondole ; la gueule\ndu requin d'une autre gondole qui passerait vous la\ncouperait net comme un navet. Le nombre des gon-\ndoles est infini , et l'on ne compte pas moins de\nsoixante mille personnes qui vivent de la rame , soit\ngondoliers ou autres. On dit aussi, pour faire valoir\nl'agrément du séjour, que la ville a toujours un fonds\nde trente mille étrangers. Cela peut avoir quelque\nfondement pendant les six mois de carnaval ; mais\nhors de là, je crois ce nombre fort exagéré.\nVous croyez peut-être que la place Saint-Marc ,\ndont on parle tant, est aussi grande que d'ici à de-\nmain. Rien moins que cela ; elle est fort au-dessous,\ntant pour la grandeur que pour le coup d'œil des\nbâtiments de la place Vendôme , bien que magnifi-\nquement bâtie ; mais elle est régulière , carrée ,\nlongue , terminée des deux bouts par les éghses de\nSaint-Marc et de San-Geminiano, et des côtés par\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\n111 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nles Procuraties Vieilles et Neuves. Ces dernières for-\nment un magnifique bâtiment, tout d'un corps de\nlogis d'une très-grande longueur, orné d'architec-\nture, et le comble couvert de statues. Tant les Neuves\nque les Vieilles sont bâties sur des arcades, sous les-\nquelles on se promène à couvert, et chaque arcade\nsert d'entrée à un café qui ne désemplit point. La\nplace est pavée de pierres de taille. On ne peut s'y\ntourner, à ce qu'on dit, pendant le carnaval, à cause\nde la quantité de masques et de théâtres. Pour moi ,\nqui n'ai pas vu cela, je l'en trouve actuellement tou-\njours pleine. Les robes de palais, les manteaux, les\nrobes de chambre, les Turcs, le Grecs, lesDalmates,\nles Levantins de toute espèce, hommes et femmes ,\nles tréteaux de vendeurs d'orviétan , de bateleurs ,\nde moines qui prêchent , et de marionnettes ; tout\ncela, dis-je , qui y est tout ensemble , à toute heure,\nla rendent la plus belle et la plus curieuse place du\nmonde , surtout par le retour d'équerre qu'elle fait\nauprès de Saint- Marc, ce que l'on nomme Broglio.\nC'est une autre place plus petite que la première ,\nformée par le palais Saint-Marc et le retour du bâti-\nment des Procuraties-Neuves. La mer, large en cet\nendroit, la termine. C'est de là qu'on voit le mélange\ndéterre, de mer, de gondoles, de boutiques, de\nvaisseaux et d'églises , de gens qui partent et qui\narrivent à chaque instant. J'y vais au moins quatre\nfois le jour pour me régaler la vue.

Il en\nparle fort pertinemment, et mieux que d'aucun autre\nendroitquej'aie encore vu ; surtout je vous épargnerai\nl'article des tableaux, à votre grande satisfaction, si\nje ne me trompe ; mais je ne ferai pas le même tort à\nQuintin, qui ne me le pardonnerait pas. On dit qu'il\ny en a plus à Venise que dans le reste de l'Italie.\nPour moi, ce que j'assurerai bien, c'est qu'il y en a\nplus que dans la France entière. La seule liste des\npeintures publiques fait un gros in-8% sans compter\nque les particuliers en ont de quoi combler l'Océan.\nOn prétend aussi, qu'à illuminer les trois étages des Procuraties en flambeaux de cire blanche la nuit de\nNoël, on brûle plus de cire ici en cette nuit que dans\ntout le reste de l'Italie pendant un an. Nous ne son-\ngeons jamais à déjeuner, Sainte-Palaye et moi, sans\nnous être au préalable mis quatre tableaux du Titien\net deux plafonds de Paul Véronèse sur la conscience.\n' Elle a été élevée, au controire, pour masquer son irrégnla- lilé.

Je me suis borné à examiner mille ou douze\ncents des principaux \\\nJe ne vous parlerai pas trop non plus du gouver-\nnement ni des mœurs ; c'est un article qu' Amelot a\ntraité à fond, et assez bien. Il ne faut pas cepen-\ndant croire tout le mal qu'il en dit, mais seulement\nla plus grande partie. Quant aux mœurs, vous aime-\nriez sûrement mieux que je vous entretinsse de cela\nque d'édifices et de peintures ; mais faites réflexion\nqu'un étranger qui passe un mois dans une ville\nn'est pas fait pour les connaître, et en parlerait pres-\nque infailliblement tout de travers. Cependant, si\nvous voulez quelque chose là-dessus, je vous dirai\nqu'il n'y a pas de lieu au monde où la liberté et la\nlicence régnent plus souverainement qu'ici. Ne vous\nmêlez pas du gouvernement, et faites d'ailleurs tout\nce que vous voudrez. Je ne parle pas de la chose\ndont nos plaisirs et nous tirons notre origine, de la\nchose proprement dite par excellence. On ne s'en\nchoque pas plus ici que de toute autre opération na-\nturelle. C'est une bonne police qui devrait être reçue\npartout.

Cependant le sang est si doux ici, que, malgré\nla facilité que donnent les masques, les allures de\nnuit, les rues étroites et surtout les ponts sans garde-\nfous, d'où l'on peut pousser un homme dans la mer\nsans qu'il s'en aperçoive, il n'arrive pas quatre acci-\ndents par an; encore n'est-ce qu'entre étrangers.\nVous pouvez juger par là combien les idées que l'on\na sur les stylets vénitiens sont mal fondées aujour-\nd'hui.\nIl en est à peu près de même de leur jalousie pour\nleurs femmes : cependant cela mérite explication.\nDès qu'une fille, entre nobles, est promise, elle met\nun masque, et personne ne la voit plus que son fu-\ntur, ou ceux à qui il le permet, ce qui est fort rare.\nEn se mariant, elle devient un meuble de commu-\nnauté pour toute la famille, chose assez bien imagi-\nnée, puisque cela supprime l'embarras de la précau-\ntion, et que l'on est sûr d'avoir des héritiers du sang.\nC'est souvent l'apanage du cadet de porter le nom\nde mari ; mais, outre cela, il est de règle qu'il y ait\nun amant; ce serait même une espèce de déshonneur\nà une femme si elle n'avait pas un homme publique-\nment sur son compte. Mais, halte là; la politique a\ntrès-grande part à ceci. La famille en use comme le\nroi de France à l'élection de l'abbé de Clteaux ; on\nlaisse choisir la femme en donnant l'exclusion à tels\nou tels. Il ne faut pas qu'elle s'avise de prendre au-\ncun autre qu'un noble, et parmi ceux-ci, un homme\nqui ait entrée dans le Pregadi ou Sénat et dans les\nconseils, dont la famille soit assez puissante pour\n\n===== Page 14 =====\n\n176 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\npouvoir favoriser les brigues, et à qui l'on puisse\ndire : Monsieur, il me faut demain matin tant de voix\npour mon beau-frère ou pour mon mari. Avec cela,\nune femme a la liberté tout entière, et peut faire\ntout ce qu'elle veut. Il faut cependant rendre justice\nà la vérité ; notre ambassadeur me disait, l'autre\njour, qu'il ne connaissait pas plus d'une cinquan-\ntaine de femmes de qualité qui couchassent avec leurs\namants. Le reste est retenu par la dévotion. Les con-\nfesseurs ont traité avec elles, qu'elles s'abstiendraient\nde l'article essentiel; moyennant quoi, ils leur font\nbon marché du reste tout aussi loin qu'il puisse s'é- tendre.\nVoilà quel est le train courant de la galanterie, où\nles étrangers n'ont pas beau jeu. Les nobles ne les\nadmettent guère ni dans leurs maisons ni dans leurs\nparties. Hs veulent vivre entre eux, et avoir leurs\ncoudées franches, pour parler devant leurs femmes,\nde brigues et de ballottages, articles sur lesquels le\ntacet s'observe exactementdevant l'étranger. Cepen-\ndant, lorsque deux personnes s'entendent, il n'est\npas impossible de faire un coup fourré à la faveur des\ngondoles, où les dames entrent toujours seules sans\nsurveillants; c'est un asile sacré. Il est inouï qu'un\ngondolier de Madame se soit laissé gagner par Mon-\nsieur ; il serait noyé le lendemain par ses camarades.\nCette pratique actuelle des dames a beaucoup dimi-\nnué les profits des religieuses, qui étaient jadis en\npossession de la galanterie. Cependant il y en a en-\ncore bon nombre qui s'en tirent aujourd'hui avec\n\n===== Page 15 =====\n\nSÉJOUR ENISE. 177\ndistinction, je pourrais dire avec émulation ; puisque,\nactuellement que je vous parle, il y a une furieuse\nbrigue entre trois couvents de la ville, pour savoir\nlequel aura l'avantage de donner une maîtresse au\nnouveau nonce qui vient d'arriver. En vérité, ce se-\nrait du côté des religieuses que je me tournerais le\nplus volontiers, si j'avais un long séjour à faire ici.\nToutes celles que j'ai vues à la messe, au travers de\nla grille, causer (ant qu'elle durait et rire ensemble,\nm'ont paru jolies au possible et mises de manière à\nfaire bien valoir leur beauté. Elles ont une petite\ncoiffure charmante, un habit simple, mais bien en<\ntendu, presque toujours blanc, qui leur découvre les\népaules et la gorge, ni plus ni moins que les habits à\nla romaine de nos comédiennes.\nPour épuiser l'article du sexe féminin il convient\nici plus qu'ailleurs de vous dire un mot de5 courti-\nsanes. Elles composent un corps vraiment respecta-\nble par les bons procédés. Il ne faut pas croire en-\ncore, comme on le dit, que le nombre en soit si grand\nque l'on marche dessus ; cela n'a lieu que pendant le\ntemps de carnaval, où l'on trouve sous les arcades des\nProcuraties autant de femmes couchées que debout ;\nhors de là, leur nombre ne s'étend pas à plus du dou-\nble de ce qu'il y en a à Paris ; mais aussi elles sont\nfort employées. Tous les jours régulièrement à vingt-\nquatre ou vingt-quatre heures et demie au plus tard,\ntoutes sont occupées. Tant pis pour ceux qui viennent\ntrop tard. A la différence de celles de Paris, toutes\nsont d'une douceur d'esprit et d'une politesse char*\n\n===== Page 16 =====\n\n178 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nmantes. Quoi que vous leur demandiez, leur -réponse\nest toujours : Sarà servito, sono a suoi commandi\n(car il est de la civilité de ne parler jamais aux gens\nqu'à la troisième personne.) A la vérité, vu la répu-\ntation dont elles jouissent, les demandes qu'on leur\nfait ordinairement sont fort bornées ; cependant j'en\ntrouvai l'autre jour une si jolie qu xxxx Le moyen\nde ne pas s'y fier, elle me répondait des conséquences\nper la beatissima madonna di Loreto.\nNous avons eu quelque peine à nous mettre un peu\ndans le beau monde ; nous sommes arrivés dans des\ncirconstances défavorables. La sérénissime républi-\nque venait de faire main basse sur près de cinq cents\ncourtiers d'amour qui, abusant de leur ministère\npublic, s'en allaient offrir à tous venants, sur la place\nSaint-Marc, madame la procuratesse celle-ci, ou ma-\ndame la chevalière celle-là ; de sorte qu'il arrivait\nquelquefois à un mari de s'entendre proposer sa\nfemme. On a réformé cette licence trompeuse et in-\nsolente. Néanmoins il ne faut pas être en peine de\nvivre aujourd'hui, pour peu qu'on choisisse bien ses\ngondoliers, et ce choix est si aisé, qu il faut être d'un\ngrand guignon pour le faire mal. Il vient de m'arri-\nver à ce sujet une plaisante aventure, qui m'a mis\npour un moment dans un embarras fort risible.\nJ'avais envoyé hier un gondolier faire Vambasciata\nà la célèbre Bagatina. Le rendez-vous était pris chez\nelle à une heure marquée. Je ne la trouvai point ; sa\nfemme de chambre me dit qu'elle avait été obligée\nde sortir avec une dame de ses amies, pour aller à la\n\n===== Page 17 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 179\nconversation chez je ne sais quel seigneur, et qu'elle\nm'en faisait excuse, me priant de revenir le lende-\nmain. Pendant ce discours, j'examinais un apparte-\nment vaste, magnifique, richement orné, et parais-\nsant fort au-dessus de l'état d'une pareille princesse.\nJe demandai à la femme de chambre si un tel gon-\ndolier n'était pas venu de ma part parler à la Baga-\ntina. Elle me répondit que le gondolier était venu\nen effet ; mais que sa maltresse ne s'appelait point\nBagatina, mais bien Abbati Marcheze, et qu'elle était\nla femme d'un noble vénitien. Mais, lai ai-je dit,\nqu'est-ce que votre maîtresse a pensé que je voulais\nd'elle ? Que vous aviez quelque lettre de recomman-\ndation à lui remettre, a-t-elle repris. Vous êtes le\nmaître, monsieur, de me la laisser ou de revenir de-\nmain, si cela vous plaît. Là-dessus j'ai fait monter le\ngondolier ; la soubrette et lui ont persisté en leur\ndire, chacun de leur côté. Le gondolier a été traité\nde birbante et de ladite ; et j'ai été congédié avec\nforce révérences, assez incertain si je retournerais le\nlendemain, et de ce que pouvait signifier un pareil\nquiproquo. Enfin je me suis déterminé à risquer le\npaquet, et j'y suis retourné aujourd'hui. J'ai trouvé\nune grande femme bien faite, d'environ trente-cinq\nans, de grand air, d'un bon maintien, magnifique-\nment vêtue et chargée de pierreries, qui, s'avançant\nà moi d'un air très-grave, m'a demandé ce que je\nsouhaitais d'elle. Je le savais assez, et mon embarras\nne roulait que sur la manière de le lui dire. Je lui ai\nbaragouiné un compliment inintelligible dans le plus\n\n===== Page 18 =====\n\n180 Xiy.— À M. DE BLANCEY.\nmauvais italien que j'ai pu, et cela ne m'est pas dif-\nficile. Enfin, s'aperce vaut de ce qui causait mon in-\ncertitude, elle a eu le bon procédé de la lever elle-\nmême au bout d'un instant, en quittant son faux nom\net sa fausse décence \\ Elle a même eu l'air surpris de\nma libéralité ; car, en faveur du meuble et de l'ha-\nbillement, j'ai doublé les sequins, ne voulant pas avoir rien mis de médiocre dans une main ornée de\ndiamants. Les nobles, j'entends ceux qui ne sont pas\nd'un goût plus raffiné, font grand usage de ces prin-\ncesses. Quand l'un d'eux veut faire une partie de\npromenade avec la sienne, elle vient tout uniment le\nprendre dans sa gondole au sortir du conseil, et l'on\nn'est pas plus surpris de l'y voir monter avec elle en\npleine place Saint-Marc qu'on ne l'a été, en temps\nde carnaval, de voir ce noble ôter son masque et son\ndomino dans l'antichambre du Conseil, pour y en-\ntrer. Ma foi ! ils ont raison, c'est un doux séjour de\njouissance qu'une gondole. Au surplus, ne croyez\npas que, malgré la fidélité dont elles se piquent pour\nleurs tenants, elles soient inaccessibles. Ce scrupule\nne dure jamais que cinq jours de la semaine ; leurs\namants mêmes leur laissent presque toujours toute\nliberté le vendredi, parce qu'ils font leurs dévotions,\net le samedi, parce qu'ils ont affaire au Pregadi.\nElles ont un usage politique assez bien trouvé, c'est\n* E poi che la sua mono alla mia pose\nCou lieto volto, onde mi conforiai ,\nMi mise flintro aile segrete rose.\nDantk.\n\n===== Page 19 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 181\nde ne rien accorder qu'à la seconde entrevue, parce\nque, disent-elles, il faut connaître avant que d'aimer.\nAu moyen de ce, on leur fait au moins deux visites,\net elles reçoivent des appointements doubles pour\nun seul service. Je crois que voilà un chapitre traité\nà fond. Je l'ai fait de la sorte en votre faveur, parce\nque je sais que vous êtes fort vicieux, et afin que vous\nn'ayez rien à désirer, j'ajouterai que les femmes sont\nplus belles ici qu'en aucun autre endroit, surtout\nparmi le peuple. Ce n'est pas qu'on y trouve plus\nqu'ailleurs des beautés ravissantes ; mais communé-\nment le grand nombre est joli et en général elles ont\ntoutes la taille et le teint beaux, la bouche grande et\nagréable, les dents blanches et bien rangées.\nXV. — A M. DE NEUILLY.\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n0 août.\nLa noblesse de Venise est, si je ne me trompe, la\nplus ancienne de l'Europe (j'entends les premières\nmaisons), puisqu'il en subsiste plusieurs de celles qui\nélurent le premier doge, il y a plus de treize cents ans.\nIls ont, tant dans l'ancienne que dans la moderne\nnoblesse, entre laquelle, par parenthèse, il n'y a\npoint de différence comme à Gênes, beaucoup de\nfamilles puissamment riches ; bien entendu que la\nrépublique met bon ordre à ce qu'elles ne le devien- I. 11\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\n182 XV. -A M.

Cette noblesse se perpétue sûre-\nment, et prouve sa descendance par le repristre\nappelé le Livre dor où l'on inscrit tous les nobles\nqui naissent ; ceux qui auraient omis de s'y faire\ninscrire ne seraient pas nobles; aussi y a-t-il des\ncitadins qui, quoique petits bourgeois, sont de la\nplus ancienne noblesse; ce qui vient de ce qu'en\non ferma tout d'un coup le Livre d'or , moyennant\nquoi il n'y a eu que ceux qui y étaient inscrits alors et\nleurs descendants qui ont été nobles. Tous ceux qui\navaient négligé de s'y faire inscrire furent exclus,\net n'ont pas aujourd'hui plus de prérogatives que\nles autres citadins* Ce n'est pas beaucoup dire assu-\nrément, car cet ordre est assez mal mené par le\ngouvernement, et plus encore les gentilshommes\nde terre ferme.

Quelques-\nuns de ceux qui sont en dignité la portent rouge,\nd'autres violette. Tous portent sur l'épaule une aune\nde drap de couleur assortissante, placée dans la vraie\nposition de la serviette d'un maître d'hôtel et sont\ncoiffés d'une perruque si démesurée, qu'en vérité\ncelle de M. Bernardon n'est plus qu'un toquet. Ils\nportent à la main une barrette de drap ou de taffetas\nnoir, faite comme nos coiffes de bonnets de nuit. La\nmanche de la robe fait encore une distinction ; plus\nla dignité est grande, plus la manclie est large (et\ncette manche n'est pas inutile pour mettre la provi-\nsion de boucherie avec une salade dans le grand\nbonnet). La manche du doge, comme de raison,\nexcède le panier d'une femme : elle est de drap d'or,\nainsi que la robe. La façon la plus humble de saluer\nles nobles est d'aller solliciter au BrogliOj et de\nbaiser la manche de celui qu'on sollicite. L'art des\nrévérences est encore un grand point : il faut les\nfaire bas, bas ; encore n'en fait-on aucun compte si\nla perruque ne traîne pas à terre d'un bon demi-\npied. Le manteau est un habillement plus commun\nencore que la robe. Tout homme qui, par son état,\nest au-dessus de l'artisan, est moins dispensé de le\nporter quand il sort, quelque chaud qu'il fasse, que\nnous ne le sommes de porter une culotte ; mais\naussi, comme chez nos femmes qui sont revenues\n\n===== Page 22 =====\n\n184 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\ndu monde, c'est-à-dire dont le monde est revenu,\nle manteau de la dévotion couvre tout. Ici le simple\nmanteau de bouracan fait le même effet. On porte\ndessous tout ce qu'on veut, et vous ne trouverez\nautre chose à la messe ou dans la place que des gens\nen pantoufles et en robe de chambre avec leur man-\nteau par-dessus. Les nobles le portent quand ils\nn'ont pas leur robe, et alors ils sont censés être\nincognito par les rues; mais, comme dit Trajano\nBoccalini : ce II manto délia religione non è in questo\ntanto lungo, che spesse volte non si vedano per di\nsotto due palme di gambe di ladro. » C'est aussi\ndans cet équipage qu'ils vont souvent le soir aux\nassemblées; surtout on ne doit point le quitter; il\nfaut, ribonfredon, faire sa partie de quadrille d'un bout à Tautre en manteau, et étouffer avec décence.\nJ'ai vu le vieux bonhomme doge Pisani prendre Tair\nsur le perron d'un casino dans cet habillement, avec\nune petite perruque bardachine. Il avait tout à fait\nl'air d'un jouvenceau; à la vérité il était malade\nalors et prenait l'air pour sa santé.\n(est une chose originale et bien occupante pour\nles nobles que l'intrigue de leur Broglio, Il y a des\ndessous de cartes admirables. On vient de me con-\nter le détail d'une aventure arrivée en dernier lieu,\nqui fait du bruit ici ; c'est à mon avis un bon conte.\nMonsieur ilfaut que je vous en fasse récit, sans vous\ngarantir les circonstances , quoique je les tienne\nd'un des ambassadeurs qui sont ici; mais vous\nn'ignorez pas jusqu'à quel point je pousse le scru-\n\n===== Page 23 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 185\npule de la fidélité historique, et que je suis incapable\nde rien assurer, même dans mon histoire des ancien-\nnes dynasties assyriennes, dont je n'aie été moi-même\nle témoin oculaire. Il faut donc que vous sachiez\nque le procurateur Tiepolo , à qui nous sommes\nrecommandés ici, et le procureur Aimo sont deux\npersonnages d'une grande autorité dans l'Etat et\nfort antagonistes l'un de l'autre. Le premier, qui est\nde la plus haute noblesse, a grand crédit dans le\nSénat, et l'autre, qui n'est pas si distingué par sa\nnaissance, a plus de pouvoir dans le Grand-Conseil,\nparce que c'est l'assemblée générale des nobles.\nC'est le Sénat qui nomme aux charges ; mais il faut\nque le Grand-Conseil confirme l'élection, sans quoi\nelle est nulle. 11 y a quelque temps que Tiepolo bri-\nguait une place dans le conseil des Dix, et Aimo, ne\nsachant comment le faire rejeter, prit le biais, sous\nprétexte de bonne manière, de faire d'abord nommer\nun autre Tiepolo, bonhomme qui ne songeait à rien,\net à qui certainement on aurait encore moins songé.\nLe procurateur Tiepolo fut fort sensible à cette poli-\ntesse, et retira ses cornes, parce que la loi ne permet\npas qu'il y ait deux personnes du même nom dans\nle conseil des Dix ; mais il jura bien de rendre à\nl'autre sa galanterie. Pour cet effet il fit nommer le\nfrère d'Aimo, personnage qui avait passé dans les\nplus grandes charges, podestat de Vicence. C'est\nune place que l'on donne aux commençants âgés de\nvingt ans, et c'est à peu près comme si Ton faisait\nle premier président avocat du roi au Châtelet.\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\n186 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nAimo le cadet cria comme un enragé, que c'était\nune berne, et qu'il n'y voulait point aller. Il eut\nbeau jurer, il fallut payer l'amende de 1,000 ducats,\nréglée contre ceux qui refusent des magistratures,\net aller en exil pour un an. Il revint d'un grand\nsang-froid au bout de l'année; mais le narquois de\nTiepolo l'attendait à l'affût et le fit nommer podestat\nde Padoue. La récidive est un peu plus chère ; elle\ncoûte 2,000 ducats et deux années de bannissement.\nAimo, pénétré de douleur, s'en allait chercher l'ar-\ngent chez lui, quand son frère le procurateur l'ar-\nrêta, lui fit entendre que ces plaisanteries-là ne fini-\nraient point et qu'il fallait qu'il allât à Padoue, lui\ndonnant sa parole que dans six mois il le ferait nom-\nmer provéditeur général de la mer, qui est une des\nplus grandes charges de l'Etat. En effet, cette place\na été vacante dans ce temps. Nous venions alors d'ar-\nriver. Aimo l'a publiquement briguée pour son frère,\net ïiepolo lui a donné pour compétiteur Loredano,\nhomme d'une grande distinction. Vous autres, bon-\nnes gens, auriez cru qu'il allait tout uniment faire\nnommer Loredano au Sénat, où sa faction était pré-\ndominante; nullement, cette voie est trop simple\npour ces gens-ci, et de plus le Grand-Conseil aurait\nbien pu détruire son ouvrage. Le biais qu'il prit fut\nau contraire de faire refuser tout à plat Loredano et\nnommer son ennemi. Mais quand il fat question\nd'aller au Grand-Conseil, Loredano dit : « Messieurs,\n((je viens d'avoir du dessous dans l'endroit où\n(( j'avais le plus beau jeu, à plus forte raison l'au-\n\n===== Page 25 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 187\n« rai-je ici. Je demande donc, au cas que je sois\n(( refusé, d'être nommé à la seconde place, qui est\n(( celle de provéditeur de Dalmatie. » Alors tous\nceux qui prétendaient à cette place ouvrirent les\noreilles, bien résolus de faire agir leur faction pour\nse délivrer d'un concurrent si redoutable, en le fai-\nsant nommer à la première. De cette sorte, Loredano\nse rendit aussi puissant que son concurrent. Pour\nemporter la balance, il s'avança une seconde fois,\ndemandant, en cas de refus de l'une et l'autre place,\nl'ambassade de Constantinople, ce qui produisit le\nmême effet pour ceux qui y prétendaient. Moyennant\nquoi il fut nommé, au Grand-Conseil, provéditeur\ngénéral, et le pauvre Aimo, qui ne pouvait plus\nbriguer les places inférieures qu'il avait déjà possé-\ndées, est demeuré à ronger ses doigts à Padoue.\nAn surplus, notez que la charge ne pouvait tomber\nqu'en très-bonnes mains, et que ces gens-ci sont\ntrop sages pour faire rouler ces sortes de jeux sur\nd'autres que sur de très-bons sujets. J'ai eu le\nplaisir d'avoir mon cœur clair de leur façon de bal-\nlotter les charges.\nOn nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand-\nConseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères ;\ncharge assez importante. Le Grand-Conseil se tient\ndans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond\nest une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et\ndes inquisiteurs d'État , avec le trône du doge au\nmilieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de\nla salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns\n\n===== Page 26 =====\n\n188 Xy.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\naux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle.\nTous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se pla-\ncèrent. Les robes rouges avaient leurs places mar-\nquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents\nlieux de la salle , pour empêcher qu'il ne se fit du\nbruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée ; chose , à\nmon gré , où ils ne réussirent nullement , puisque\nTon y faisait un sabbat de l'autre monde ; aussi ne\nfaisait-on là que peloter en attendant partie. Près du\ngrand chancelier , sur l'estrade , il y avait une urne\ncontenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avait de\npersonnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de\ndorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent\ncelles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en\nquestion, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par\nleurs places , étaient électeurs de droit. Cela fait ,\nnous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin , ornée de la\nmême manière que la première, moins grande, rem-\nplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse.\nLes autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre , sa-\nluant jusqu'à terre les précédents avec une gravité\nsans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé , le chan-\ncelier parut précédé du corps des secrétaires , gens\nsubalternes , et précédant lui-même le vice-doge ;\ncar le doge était malade , et c'est le plus vieux des\nconseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas\nsur le trône et n*a pas le corno ; il Timitait tant qu'il\npouvait , ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet\nde taffetas noir , dont il ramenait le sommet par-\ndevant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable\n\n===== Page 27 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 189\nAnténor. Il était suivi de tous les conseillers en robes\nrouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva ; il\nla salua profondément sans ôter sa barrette que pour\nla Qua?'antie crimineWe, lorsqu'il passa devant elle.\nSeul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avait surla téte. Il\nmonta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et\nautres se placèrent autour de lui , et sur les ailes le\nchancelier à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le\nchef. Cette assemblée avait l'air tout à fait majes-\ntueux. Alors le chancelier se leva et dit que les sei-\ngneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini deman-\ndaient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs\nparents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédia-\ntement après, les trois i4î;t'o6/on prirent chacun un\npetit Évangile , et parcoururent les rangs en faisant\ntoucher à chacun cet Evangile du bout du doigt ,\nmarque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne\nfoi et sans brigue. Tous ces préalables finis , un\ngrand marsouin d'huissier , ayant mis une paire de\nlunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'était davan-\ntage, proclama d'un ton nasillard Veccellentissimo\nsignore Luca Priuli. A l'instant une vingtaine de\npetits enfants rouges comme ceux de l'hôpital se dis-\npersèrent par la salle , criant comme des perdus :\nPriuli ! Priuli ! Ils avaient chacun à la main une\nboite à deux compartiments , l'un blanc pour nom-\nmer, l'autre vert pour refuser ; l'ouverture commune\nétant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne\npuissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on\nmet la main , et à leur ceinture une gibecière pleine\nI. 11.\n\n===== Page 28 =====\n\n190 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nde petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemi-\nsette ; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci\nla mirent dans celle des enchàtres qu'ils voulurent.\nLes enfants portèrent leurs boites au chancelier, qui\nversa les ballottes des enchàtres blanches dans un\nbassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les\ntrois autres concurrents ; puis on compta les suf-\nfrages. Donato fut élu et nous sortîmes. Tout cela\nfut fait avec une rapidité surprenante , et en moins\nde temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris ; mais\nc'était une vraie comédie que de voir en sortant les\nprosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice\nqu'on lui donnait. D'honneur, ils sonnaient à se faire\nentendre au milieu de la place.\nJ'ai aussi vu ce que l'on appelle une fonction,\nc'est-à-dire une cérémonie où tous les grands magis-\ntrats vont en corps à une fête d'église. Je ne vous\nen parlerai guère, car cela ne vaut pas mieux que la\nprocession de la sainte hostie ; le cortège des ambassa-\ndeurs en est le principal ornement. Ils y assistent à\ncôté du doge avec leur maison ; mais ce qu'il y a de\nmieux, c'est la marche.\nUne procession en gondoles est à mon gré un\nmorceau divin , d'autant mieux que ce ne sont point\nalors des gondoles ordinaires , mais celles de la ré-\npublique, superbement sculptées et dorées , accom-\npagnées de celles des ambassadeurs, plus riches et\nplus galantes encore, surtout celle du nôtre. Ils sont\nles seuls dans l'Etat à qui il soit permis d'en avoir\nqui ne soient pas noires. Les gondoliers de la répu-\n\n===== Page 29 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 191\nblique sont tous en chapes de velours rouge , cha-\nmarrées d'or, avec de grands bonnets à l'albanaise.\nIls sont trop fiers de cet équipage pour se donner la\npeine de ramer. Aussi se font-ils remorquer bien et\nbeau par des petits bateaux remplis d'instruments de\nmusique.\nC'est assez parler de choses publiques; j'aurais\nbien de la peine à en dire autant des maisons parti-\nculières. Ici les étrangers n'ont pas trop beau jeu là- dessus. Messieurs les nobles viennent le soir au café\noù ils causent de fort bonne amitié avec nous; mais,\npour nous introduire dans leurs maisons, c'est une\nautre affaire. Avec cela il y a ici fort peu de maisons\noù l'on tienne assemblée, et ces assemblées ne sont\nni nombreuses ni amusantes pour des étrangers. On\nn'y a pas même la ressource du jeu; car il faudrait\nêtre pis que sorcier pour connaître leurs cartes, qui\nn'ont ni le nom ni la figure des nôtres. Les Véni-\ntiens, avec tout leur faste et leurs palais, ne savent\nce que c'est que de donner un poulet à personne, j'ai\nété quelquefois à la conversation chez la procura-\ntesse Foscarini , maison d'une richesse immense, et\nfemme très-gracieuse d'ailleurs; pour tout régal,\nsur les trois heures c'est-à-dire à onze heures du\nsoir de France vingt valets apportent dans un plat\nd'argent démesuré une grosse citrouille coupée en\nquartiers, que l'on qualifie du nom de melon d'eau,\nmets détestable s'il en fut jamais. Une pile d'as-\nsiettes d'argent l'accompagnent ; chacun se jette sur\nun quartier, prend par-dessus une petite tasse de\n\n===== Page 30 =====\n\n192 XV.— A M.

Je vous dirai franche-\nment qu'un des grands désagréments du voyage est\nde n'avoir pas, quand le soir vient, ses bonnes Pous-\nselines, son gros Blancey, son bon Quintin , ses amis\nMaleteste et Bévy, sa dame Courtois, ces excellentes\npetites dames de Montot et Bourbonne ; enfin tout\nnotre petit cercle, pour tenir, les coudes sur la table,\ndes propos de cent piques au-dessus de la place\nSaint-Marc et du Broglio, Il faut s'attendre, en pays\nétranger, à avoir les yeux satisfaits et le cœur en-\nnuyé ; de l'amusement de curiosité tant qu'il vous\nplaira, mais des ressources de société, aucune. Vous\nne vivez qu'avec des gens pour qui vous êtes sans\nintérêt, comme ils le sont pour vous. Et, quelque\naimables qu'ils fussent d'ailleurs, le moyen d'en\nprendre réciproquement la peine, quand on songe\nque l'on doit se quitter sous peu de jours, pour ne se\nrevoir jamais.\nIci notre principale ressource a été dans notre\nambassadeur, de qui nous recevons toutes sortes de\nbons traitements. C'est le comte de Froulay, qui\nrépare fort bien ici l'honneur de la nation, qui avait\nété un peu maléficié par son prédécesseur. Il nous a\nmenés plusieurs fois à sa maison de campagne en\nterre ferme, qui est vraiment fort belle, et nous a\ndonné l'accointance de tous les ambassadeurs ;\nmoyennant quoi notre porte est fort honorée des\nvisites de leurs excellences, et notre appétit fort satis-\nfait des festins dont ils nous régalent, surtout l'am-\n\n===== Page 31 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 193\nbassadeur de Naples, qui est un ribaud des plus\nfrancs que l'on puisse voir, fort honnête prêtre d'ail-\nleurs, homme de bonne compagnie et sans façon. Le\nmétier d'ambassadeur est assez triste ici ; ils n'ont de\nressource que celle de vivre ensemble, et ne peuvent\nabsolument voir aucun noble, auxquels il est dé-\nfendu, sous peine de mort, d'entrer chez eux. Ceci\nn'est point comminatoire, et l'on a vu un noble exé-\ncuté à mort, seulement pour avoir traversé la mai-\nson d'un ambassadeur, sans parler à personne, pour\naller voir en secret sa maltresse. Du reste, les am-\nbassadeurs ont de très-grands droits, entre autres,\nun fort particulier, d'avoir autour de leurs maisons\nun quartier de franchise très-étendu, où l'on ne peut\narrêter personne sans leur permission, et où ils exer-\ncent souverainement la police et la justice. Nous\navons vu aussi le vieux bonhomme maréchal Schu-\nlembourg, général des troupes de la république ;\nvous savez qu'elle a presque toujours des étrangers\npour cette place, qui ne vaut pas moins de cent mille\nécus de rente. C'est un bien honnête vieillard, qui\nentend la guerre à merveille et fort mal la morale.\nIl nous fait sur le chapitre des filles de fréquents ser-\nmons, peu écoutés et point du tout suivis; mais il\nfait plus de fruit à table, en nous faisant grande\nchère à l'allemande.

Par exemple, vous connaissez de répu-\ntion le palais de Saint-Marc; c'est un vilan monsieur,\ns'il en fut jamais, massif, sombre et gothique, du\nplus méchant goût. La grande cour en dedans ne\nlaisse pas cependant, surtout d'un côté, d'avoir quel-\nque chose de magnifique dans sa construction ; elle\nest assez singulièrement ornée par deux puits, dont\nles margelles prodigieuses, d'un seul jet de bronze,\n\n===== Page 33 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISK. 195\nsont d'un travail aussi fini que considérable, et par\nun superbe escalier tout de marbre blanc et violet,\nqu'on a nommé par anticipation , sachant que j'y\ndevais passer, V escalier des Géants, Il conduit à un\nautre, fort orné de statues et de dorures, qui conduit\nlui-même aux salles où se tiennent les différents con-\nseils. Ces appartements, selon l'ordinaire des vieux\npalais, sont mal distribués, mal tenus et assez som-\nbres; mais si fort enrichis de peintures des plus\ngrands maîtres, qu'il n'a pas fallu moins de huit\njours entiers à notre badauderie pour en voir le\nbout. Le doge est logé dans ce palais; c'est de tous\nles prisonniers de l'État le plus mal glté à mon gré ;\ncar les prisons ordinaires, qui sont près du palais,\nsont un bâtiment tout à fait élégant et agréable. Je\nne veux cependant pas y séjourner trop longtemps,\net je vais au plus vite à Téglise de Saint- Marc.\nVous vous êtes figuré que c'était un lieu admira-\nble ; mais vous vous trompez bien fort ; c'est une\néglise à la grecque, basse, impénétrable à la lumière,\nd'un goût misérable, tant en dedans qu'en dehors,\ncouverte de sept dômes revêtus en dedans de mosaï-\nques à fond d'or, qui les font ressembler bien mieux\nà des chaudières qu'à des coupoles. Elle a double\ncollatérale, dont les deux extérieures ne servent\nguère que de passage ou de promenoirs, et un long\nvestibule destiné au même usage. Avec les richesses\nimmenses qu'on y a prodiguées, il a bien fallu qu'à\n1 Charles de Brosses était d'une très-petite taille. R. G.\n\n===== Page 34 =====\n\n196 XVI.— A M. DE QTTINTIN.\nla fin elle fût curieuse, en dépit des ouvriers diabo-\nliques qui les ont mises en œuvre. Du haut en bas,\nen dedans et en dehors, Tégiise est couverte de pein-\ntures en mosaïque à fond d'or. Vous savez que la\nmosaïque est une peinture qui se fait avec des petites\npièces d'environ trois lignes en carré de pierres na-\nturelles, ou de verre mis en couleur, qui servent à\nnuer et à dessiner le sujet. Ces ouvrages ne peuvent\njamais être bien délicats mais aussi le coloris n'est\npas sujet à se perdre, ce qui a engagé les premiers\npeintres à s'en servir souvent. Maintenant la patience\ninouïe qu'il faut pour cela et le peu de beauté dont\nces ouvrages sont susceptibles en ont fait depuis né-\ngliger la méthode. Celles-ci doivent être regardées\ncomme le premier monument de la peinture, puis-\nqu'elles ont été faites dès l'an 1071, par des ouvriers\ngrecs qu'on fît venir exprès. Ainsi, n'en déplaise aux\nFlorentins, ce n'est point chez eux, c'est ici que cet\nart s'est renouvelé. Leur Cimabue, plus de cent cin-\nquante ans après, vint en prendre l'idée sur les ou-\nvrages de Saint-Marc. C'est en vérité la seule obli-\ngation qu'on ait, tant à lui qu'à ces gens-ci, que\nd'avoir eu le goût assez pervers pour faire les\nméchantes choses qui depuis ont donné lieu à en\nfaire de si belles. Au coloris près, qui s'est assez\nconservé par le genre de l'ouvrage, on ne peut rien\nvoir de si pitoyable que ces mosaïques ; heureuse-\nment les ouvriers ont eu la sage précaution d'écrire\nsur chaque sujet ce qu'ils ont voulu représenter\n1 Dans une mosaïque placée sous le portique, on voit Adam et\n\n===== Page 35 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 197\nLes autres morceaux du méjue genre, que Ton a faits\ndepuis sont mieux exécutés ; il y en a beaucoup qui\nse distinguent par la brillante vivacité du coloris et\ndes fonds d'or; mais en général il n'y a rien là de\nfort satisfaisant, si ce n'est le plafond de la sacristie\noù l'on a eu le bon esprit de représenter, non des\nfigures, mais des broderies et des arabesques de la\ndernière beauté ; c'est le seul genre où la mosaïque\nsoit propre. Le pavé est aussi en entier de mosaïque,\ncomposé de plusieurs mille millions de ces petites\npièces de marbre, jaspes, lapis, agates, serpentine,\ncuivre, etc., sur lequel on ne peut faire un pas sans\nglisser. Le tout a été si bien joint que, quoique le\npavé se soit enfoncé dans certains endroits et fort\nrelevé dans d'autres, aucune petite pièce ne s'est\ndémentie ni n'a sauté; bref, c'est sans contredit le\npremier endroit du monde pour jouer à la toupie.\nBelle comparaison et tout à fait noble ! Une personne\nde goût, telle que vous êtes, ne peut manquer d'en être contente.\nJe ne vous parlerai ni des reliques que Misson a\ntraitées à fond, ni du trésor. Ce n'est pas que je ne\npusse, si je voulais vous en faire une docte et ample\ndescription; mais dans le vrai, je ne l'ai pas vu.

C'est en ce siècle- là, ou environ, que fut écrit le fameux livre de TEvangile\nde Saint-Marc, qu'on garde encore aujourd'hui dans le trésor de\nVenise. Je l'ai vu et examiné autant qu'on peut examiner un ma- nuscrit qui est déjà presque tout effacé, et si pourri que les feuilles\nétant toutes collées l'une contre l'autre, on ne péut tenter de tour-\nner un feuillet sans que tout s'en aille en pièces. Ces feuilles de\npapier d'Égypte me semblèrent beaucoup plus délicates que toutes\nles autres que j'ai vues en différents endroits. Sur la forme des\nlettres, il me parut que c'est le plus ancien manuscrit qu'on ait\nencore vu, et qu'on ne se hasarde guère en disant qu'il est pour\nle plus tard du iv siècle. Il y a cent-quarante-six ans qu'on l'a mis dans un caveau souterrain dont la voûte même est plus basse dans\nles marées que la mer voisine. De là vient que l'eau dégoutte per-\npétuellement sur ceux que la curiosité y amène. Cette grande hu-\nmidité a mis le manuscrit en un état qu'on n'y saurait lire deux\nmots de suite.

Montfaucon s'exhale par-\ntout en plaintes contre le peu d'accès qu'on trouve\ndans les bibliothèques d'Italie ; il devrait plutôt dire\nque les gens de ce pays-ci se défient tellement des\nmoines, qu'ils ne veulent rien montrer aux gens de\ncette robe, quelque mérite qu'ils aient d'ailleurs.\nZanetti fait imprimer maintenant le catalogue et la\nnotice de tous les manuscrits de Saint-Marc. Il me\nmontra un livre qui passe pour le premier imprimé\nen France. Il est intitulé : Guillelmi Ficheti alnetani\n Zanetli (Antoine-Marie), bibliothécaire de Saint-Marc, auteur\nd'un fort bon livre sur les peintures de l'école de Venise.

L'impres-\nsion en est fort belle, sur vélin, avecles lettres prin-\ncipales et les remplissages des alinéa en miniatures\nfaites à la main. Au commencement du livre, contre\nl'usage ordinaire de ce temps-là, et non à la fin,\nest écrit : jEdibus Sorhonœ Parisii scriptum impres-\nsumque anno uno et septuagesimo supra mille-\nsimum.\nLe vestibule de cette bibliothèque est digne de la\nplus grande curiosité, par les statues antiques qu'on\ny a rassemblées : un Ganymède de marbre, accroché\nje ne sais par où (car Taigle qui est dessus ne le tient\npresque point), est suspendu au plafond. Mais tout\ncède à la beauté inimitable de la Léda et de son\ncygne. C'est une fille qui aime l'ordre et l'arrange-\nment; à cet effet, elle a la main passée, je ne sais\ncomme, pour mettre chaque chose à sa place. C'est\nune expression qui ne peut se figurer et au-dessus\nde tout ce que j'ai jamais vu dans les originaux\nvivants, et cependant j'en ai bien vu.\nIl faut que vous preniez votre mal en patience\nsur le Stace ; vous ne l'aurez point, il n'a point été\nimprimé ici, non plus qu'aucun des rares ad usum\nDelphini, Il faut encore vous détacher d'avoir, du\nmoins de très-longtemps, la suite du Musœiim Flo-\nrentinum; mais si vous voulez en récompense le\nMiisœum Venetiarum, qu'on grave à présent, vous\nen êtes le maître. Voilà le prospectus où vous trou-\nverez tout le détail de ce que contient cet ouvrage.\n\n===== Page 39 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 201\nJe l'ai vu; il est fort bien exécuté ; les gravures sont\nbelles et sans hachures, dans le goût de Mellan Au\ncas que vous en soyez curieux, je vous porterai le\npremier tome qui est presque fini; il n'y aura que\ndeux volumes. Ce sont de jeunes tilles qui travaillent\nà cet ouvrage ; il est enrichi de plusieurs pierres\ngravées tirées du fameux cabinet de ïiepolo, qu'il\nfaut que vous voyiez quand vous serez ici, et de\ncelui d'Antonio Zanetti, célèbre brocanteur. N'ou-\nbliez pas non plus de voir en passant le cabinet de\nlivres recherchés de l'Anglais Smith, où il a rassem-\nblé une rare collection d'éditions de 1400.\nNe vous figurez pas que les canaux qui forment\nici les seules rues praticables aient des quais ; pres-\nque tous n'en ont point : la mer bat jusque sur le\nseuil des portes de chaque maison. Dès qu'on en sort,\non a le pied dedans. Cela n'en est peut-être pas\nmieux ; mais cela est plus singulier , et n'est pas plus\nembarrassant pour sortir. Ceux qui n'ont point de\ngondoles à eux trouvent à chaque instant des fiacres\naquatiques dans les carrefours, et comme cette ville\nest toute d'Ilots et de pilotis, chaque maison a aussi\nson issue sur la terre. Les rues sans nombre , sont\nétroites à ne pouvoir passer deux de front sans se\ncoudoyer, toutes pavées de pierres plates ce qui les\nrend glissantes à l'excès à la moindre pluie : elles se\ncommuniquent par cinq cents ponts ou plus.

Les canaux, malgré\nleurs agréments, ont une chose intolérable. Le flux\net reflux sont ici comme dans l'Océan , et quand la\nmer est basse en été , les canaux étroits sont d'une\nhorrible infection. On sait bien qu'il faut que les\nchoses sentent ce qu'elle doivent sentir. Il est permis\naux canaux quels qu'ils soient , de puotter en été ;\nmais pour le coup, c'est abuser de la permission.\nLa ville, en général, n'est pas fort bien bâtie ; ce-\npendant elle a un air de distinction. Plusieurs belles\narchitectures d'églises, comme Saint-Pierre, San-\nGiorgio , San-Francesco , la Sainte , le Redentore ,\nSafi-Salvatore , etc. ; presque toutes du Palladio ou\ndu Sansovino ; sans parler de nombre de palais ma-\ngnifiques sur le Grand Canal, dont les meilleurs sont\nles palais Grimani, Pesaro, Cornaro etLabia; mais\ncomme je vous ai donné parole de ne point parler de\ntableaux, l'architecture ira de compagnie, et je n'en\ndirai plus mot. C'est pourtant ici que sont les chefs-\nd'œuvre sans nombre qu'a produits en peinture l'é-\ncole vénitienne. On a imprimé une notice des ta-\nbleaux publicSj dans laquelle une grande quantité de\nbelles choses se trouvent noyées dans une quantité\ninfiniment plus grande de nlédidcres où de mau-\nvaises. Il me faudrait huit jours de narration pour\nfaire le triage en détail ; voilà ce qui sauve mes au-\nditeurs. Quant à vous, ainsi que je l'ai annoncé, vous\nn'y perdrez rien ; mais ne serait-on pas fâché de ne\nm'entendre rien dire de la Rosalba, cette fameuse\n\n===== Page 41 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VÉNISÈ. 203\npeintre de portraits au pastel, qui a tout surpassé en\nce genre ? J'étais tenté de lui faire faire le mien , si\nje n'avais pensé que ma figure ne valait pas trente\nsequins. En récompense , j'eus la folie de lui offrir\nvingt - cinq louis d'or d'une Madeleine grande\ncomme la main, qu'elle a copiée d'après le Corrége.\nC'était le prix qu'elle l'estimait; et, par bonheur\npour mes vingt-cinq louis , elle ne veut pas s'en dé-\nfaire. Ajoutez encore la remarque suivante à l'article\ndes bâtiments. Dans une très-belle église que l'on\nconstruit actuellement, parmi les jaspes de Sicile\ndont elle est revêtue , on y a mêlé des papiers mar-\nbrés et vernis couverts de talcs, qui font un aussi bon\neffet que le jaspe ; reste à savoir si cela durera long-\ntemps.\nLes palais sont ici d'une magnificence prodiguée\nsans beaucoup de goût. Il n'y a pas moins de deux\ncents pièces d'appartements tout chargés de ri-\nchesses , dans le seul palais Foscarini ; mais tout se\nsurmarche ; il n'y a pas un seul cabinet ni un fau-\nteuil où Von puisse s'asseoir, à cause de la délicatesse\ndes sculptures* Lé palais Labia construit à la mo-\nderne, est le seul qui m'ait paru bien entendu en de-\ndans.

Je lui offris de la conduire en France con-\njointement avec ses bijoux.\nVenons à l'arsenal. Il est si célèbre, que je fus\nd'abord assez mécontent de trouver les salles des\narmes mal rangées, pleines de vieilleries et de\nrouille , et assez inférieures à d'autres que j'ai vues.\nIl faut néanmoins convenir qu'il est très-remarquable\npar sa vaste étendue et par la quantité de choses\nqu'il contient. Voici les principales qui me soient\nrestées dans l'esprit : des parcs de canôns de fonte et\nde fer, dont quelques-uns sont monstrueux, en\nnombre si étonnant qu'il surpasse celui des fusils et\ndes pistolets ; les tours où on les tourne pour les\nrendre unis en dedans ; la pièce qui fut fondue de-\nvant Henri III, chargée d'ornements et de sculptures\nexcellentes. Un recueil d'ancres de prodigieuses\ngrosseurs; un autre de mâts à l'équivalent.... Des\nsalles et des fabriques de toute espèce.... Trois gros\nrobinets de fontaine qui donnent du vin les ou-\nvriers en vont prendre là tant qu'ils veulent ; ils sont\nau nombre de trois mille , et s'amusent presque tout\nle jour sans travailler ; mais aussi quand il le faut,\nils font merveille jour et nuit ; ils voient quand l'af-\nfaire est pressante , parce qu'alors on double leur\npaye. Une salle des câbles , d'une architecture en\n\n===== Page 43 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 205\nbois, très-belle ; les fabriques couvertes où Ton con-\nstruit les vaisseaux , et les grands canaux où on les\njette. Il y a actuellement dix-huit gros bâtiments sur\nces chantiers ; les péottes et gondoles dorées de la\nrépublique ; et enfin le Bucentaure. Celui - ci est à\nmon gré une des belles et des curieuses choses de\nl'univers. C'est une grosse galéasse , ou fort grande\ngalère, toute sculptée et dorée à fond en dehors, du\nmeilleur goût et de la manière la plus finie. Le de-\ndans forme une vastissime salle parquetée, garnie de\nsofas tout autour et d'un trône au bout, pour le doge.\nElle est partagée dans sa longueur par une ligne de\nstatues dorées qui soutiennent le plafond ou pont\nsculpté et doré en plein. Les embrasures des fe-\nnêtres , l'éperon des balcons de la poupe, les bancs\ndes rameurs et le gouvernail sont du même goût, et\ntoute la machine a pour toit une tente de velours,\ncouleur de feu, brodée d'or.\nLe petit arsenal du palais Saint-Marc est plus\nagréable et mieux rangé que le grand ; il commu-\nnique à la salle du Grand Conseil , et les armes sont\ntoujours chargées, pour être toutes prêtes à la dé-\nfense en cas d'émeute populaire ; car avouez que,\nlorsque le corps des nobles est assemblé, une conju-\nration ou une sédition aurait beau jeu pour s'en dé-\nfaire d'un coup de filet ; aussi y a-t-il toujours alors\nà la tour Saint-Marc des procurateurs qui, sous d'au-\ntres prétextes, ont l'œil alerte, tandis que l'assem-\nblée se tient. Il est fort rempli de choses curieuses,\ndont il me semble que les relations imprimées par-\nI. 12\n\n===== Page 44 =====\n\n206 XVI.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nlent avec assez d'exactitude. On y conserve quantité\nd'armures de grands capitaines ; celle de Henri IV,\ndont il fit présent à la république, est comme de rai-\nson dans le lieu le plus honorable. J'ai remarqué un\ncoup de fusil dans cette armure. C'est aussi là qu'est\nun cadenas célèbre, dont jadis un certain tyran de\nPadoue, inventeur de cette machine odieuse, se ser-\nvait pour mettre en sûreté l'honneur de sa femme. Il\nfallait que cette femme eût 'bien de l'honneur, car la\nserrure est diablement large.\nL'inquisition existe à Venise ; mais elle a les on-\ngles tellement rognés, que c'est à peu près comme\nsil n'y en avait point. Les ministres de ce tribunal\nne peuvent rien conclure qu'en présence de trois\npersonnes du gouvernement, préposées à cet effet.\nDès qu'on avance une proposition tant soit peu forte,\nune des trois se lève et sort ; dès lors l'assemblée ne\npeut plus rien faire. Les gens d'Eglise n'ont pas beau\njeu ici pour cabaler : dès qu'un homme a quelque\nbénéfice, quelque brevet de Rome ou simplement\nle petit collet, il est exclu ipso facto de toute part au\ngouvernement, et sensé démis de sa charge s'il en a\nune. Toute personne qui a ou qui a eu charge de mi-\nnistre de la république à Rome ne peut jamais être\nfait cardinal ni obtenir aucune prélature. Sage poli-\ntique, qui a même son avantage pour les ecclésias-\ntiques, car les gens qui aiment le repos ou qui ne\nveulent pas être ballottés n'ont qu'à se faire abbés.\n\n===== Page 45 =====\n\nXVII.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nObservations sur quelques tableaux de Venise.\nA Fondaco dei Tedeschi, l'extérieur du bâtiment\net une partie de l'intérieur peints à fresque, par le\nGiorgione, peintures presque entièrement effacées ;\nperte très-déplorable ; ce devait être le plus bel et le\nplus grand ouvrage du Giorgione, peintre d'autant\nplus aimable par son coloris, qu'il n'a point eu de\nmodèle dans cette belle partie de la peinture dont il\nest, à vraidirC;, l'inventeur. Le coloris du Giorgione\nest d'une entente et d'une lierté étonnantes ; mais il\ny a quelque chose de brusque et de sauvage. Je le\ncomparerais volontiers, pour le coloris, à ce qu'est\nMichel- Ange pour le dessin. Avant lui, on dessinait\ndes figures gothiques que Ton coloriait avec soin et\navec éclat, d'une manière sèche et sans fin. Ces deux\nmaîtres sont les czars Pierre de la peinture, qui en\nont banni la barbarie ; mais ce n'a pas été sans féro-\ncité. Au dedans, quantité d'assez bonnes peintures,\nsurtout les Bains de Diane et le Jugement de Paris.\nA Saint-Roch, la Piscine probatique, merveilleux\nouvrage du Tintoret. C'est là qu'il a montré qu'il\nsavait parfaitement, lorsqu'il voulait s'en donner la\npeine, ordonner sans furie, dessiner sans rudesse et\n\n===== Page 46 =====\n\n208 XVir.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\ncolorier sans noirceur. Je serais fort enclin à juger\nque le Tintoret est le premier de tous les peintres\nvénitiens, lorsqu'il veut bien faire, ce qui lui arrive\ntrès-rarement. — Saint-Martin faisant l'aumône,\nbonne fresque du Pordenone.\nLe Tintoret a peint à l'école Saint-Roch une partie\nde la vie de Jésus-Christ, dans une quantité de grands\ntableaux. La vie d'un autre peintre n'aurait pas suffi\nà faire tout ce qu'il a exécuté ici, et presque toujours\nfort bien. C'est là que tout peintre trouvera une école\ninépuisable de dessins et de clairs-obscurs : l'An-\nnonciation, la Fuite en Egypte, la Cène, et surtout\nla figure de Jésus-Christ, vêtu de blanc devant Pi-\nlate, et le grand tableau du Crucifiement, chef-\nd'œuvre du Tintoret, dont Augustin Carrache a\ngravé une si belle estampe, m'ont paru admirables.\nQuel dommage que ce peintre, avec tant de talent,\nn'ait point du tout connu les grâces qui peuvent seu-\nles leur donner du prix !\nUne chapelle est remplie de belles choses, mal\nplacées dans ce lieu obscur, où on les voit à peine.\nIl faut considérer le mieux que l'on pourra le ta-\nbleau du Baptême de Jésus-Christ, et le beau pla-\nfond représentant l'Adoration des Mages ; la Recon-\nnaissance de saint Nicolas, les Stigmates de saint\nFrançois, et les quatre Évangélistes, par le Véronèse ;\nla Vierge avec saint André, et la Prédication de\nsaint Jean-Baptiste, par le Fiammingo, et surtout\n1 Denis Calvart. R. C.\n\n===== Page 47 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLEAUX DE VENISE. 209\nla Vierge avec saint Sébastien, saint Nicolas, etc.,\npar le Titien. Cet excellent tableau est fort noirci\npar le peu de soin qu'on en a eu, et par la mauvaise\ndisposition du lieu. La figure de saint Sébastien est\ntrès-délicate, très-agréable, mais peut-être aussi\ntrop ronde et trop efféminée.\nOn pourrait appeler Saint-Sébastien l'école de\nPaul Véronèse. On y voit la gradation de son génie,\nde ses divers ouvrages et de toutes ses manières. Le\nplafond de la sacristie, représentant le Couronne-\nment de la Vierge , par où il a commencé , est fort\ninférieur à ce qu'il a fait depuis. Les plus belles\npeintures qu'il ait faites ici sont le plafond de l'église,\nreprésentant l'histoire d'Esther ; les portes de l'orgue\nreprésentant au dehors la Purification et la Guérison\ndu Paralytique ; le tableau représentant saint Sébas-\ntien devant le tyran, celui de saint Sébastien Hé à\nun tronc d'arbre; le grand Festin de Jésus-Christ\nchez Simon le lépreux , peint dans le réfectoire ; et\nsurtout le Martyre de saint Marc et de saint Marcel-\nlian, ouvrage très-bien composé, où tout se rapporte\nau sujet; chose rare dans les ordonnances de Paul,\nqui n'a pas mieux connu l'unité d'action que le cos-\ntume. Quant aux quatre grands Festins de cet auteur,\nle premier de tous, sans contredit, est celui des\nNoces de Cana, peint dans le réfectoire de Saint-\nGeorges ; puis celui chez le pharisien , qui était ci-\ndevant aux Servîtes, et qui est à présent à Versailles\ndans le grand salon d'Hercule ; puis celui chez le\nlévite, peint à l'éghse des Saints-Jean-et-Paul ; mais\n\n===== Page 48 =====\n\n210 XVII.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nces deux peuvent aller en concurrence, et enfin celui\nque l'on voit ici à Saint-Sébastien, qui est le moindre\ndes quatre. Paul s'est beaucoup copié lui-même dans\ntous ses ouvrages, mais surtout dans ses quatre\nFestins.\nA l'école de la Charité, la Vierge Marie montant\nles degrés du temple, par le Titien, tableau de la\npremière classe; avec le saint Pierre, martyr, ils\npassent pour les deux plus beaux du Titien : celui-ci\nest fort distingué pour ses airs de tête et son admi-\nrable coloris. Il m'a fait plus de plaisir que le Saint-\nPierre, martyr; et le Saint-Laurent des Jésuites m'en\na plus fait que l'un et l'autre. Cependant celui-ci ,\nqui est de la seconde manière du Titien , l'emporte\nde beaucoup par le coloris sur le Saint-Laurent, qui\nn'est que de sa troisième manière ; alors son coloris\nest devenu trop vague et négligé.\nEnfin à San-Giorgio, dans le fond du réfectoire,\nles Noces de Cana de Paul Véronèse, tableau non-\nseulement de la première classe, mais des premiers\nde cette classe. On peut le mettre en comparaison\navec la Bataille de Constantin contre le tyran\nMaxence , peinte au Yatican , par Raphaël et par\nJules Romain, soit pour la grandeur de la composi-\ntion , soit pour le nombre infini des figures, soit pour\nl'extrême beauté de l'exécution. Il y a bien plus de\nfeu , plus de dessin , plus de science, plus de fidélité\nde costume dans la bataille de Constantin ; mais dans\ncelui-ci , quelle richesse ! quel coloris ! quelle har-\nmonie dans les couleurs! quelle vérité dans les\n\n===== Page 49 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLËAUX DE VENISE. 211\nétoffes ! quelle ordonnance et quelle machine éton-\nnante dans toute la composition ! L'un de ces ta-\nbleaux est une action vive, et l'autre est un spectacle.\nIl semble dans celui-ci qu'on aille passer tout au\ntravers des portiques, et que la foule des ns qui y\nsont assemblés vous fassent compagnie. L'architec-\nture, qui est une des belles parties du tableau, a été\nfaite par Benedetto Caliari , frère de Paul : il excel-\nlait dans ce genre. Paul a représenté au naturel les\nplus fameux peintres vénitiens exécutant un concert.\nAu-devant du tableau, dans le vide de l'intérieur du\ntriclinium, le Titien joue de la basse ; Paul joue de\nla viole; le Tintoret du violon, et le Bassan de la\nflûte, par où il a voulu faire allusion à la profonde\nscience et à l'exécution lente et sage du Titien , aux\nbrillants et aux agréments de Paul , à la rapidité du\nTintoret, et à la suavité du Bassan. Remarquez l'at-\ntention que donne Paul à un homme qui vient lui\nparler, et la suspension de son archet. Une grande\nfigure debout tenant une coupe à la main, vêtue\nd'une étoffe à l'orientale blanche et verte, est celle\nde Benedetto, son frère.\nCe n'est pas sans plaisir que j'ai trouvé, à Casa\nPisani, l'admirable Famille de Darius de ce même\nPaul Véronèse, tableau dont j'ai l'esquisse faite de\nsa main, pour l'exécution de son grand ouvrage. Il y\na deux ou trois tètes finies par le maître ; le reste en\npartie achevé par ses élèves, en partie resté en ébau-\nche. On y voit aussi Loth enivré par ses filles du\ncavalier Liberi. Ce peintre travaillait d'une assez\n\n===== Page 50 =====\n\n212 XVIII.— A M. DE BLAN€EY.\ngrande manière et avait beaucoup étudié Michel-\nAnge. Il réussit assez bien dans la composition\ndes tableaux d'histoire, et aimait entre autres à\npeindre des nudités et des sujets libres. Ses figu-\nres sont grosses, ses chairs rouges et fort san-\nguines.\nXVIII. — A M. DE BLANCEY,\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n29 août.\nCe que j'avais prévu est arrivé, mon gros Blan-\ncey ; votre première lettre vient de m'ètre renvoyée\nde Rome; elle n'est pas de fraîche date, quoique\nfort moderne en comparaison d'une autre que je\nreçois de Londres , laquelle a été renvoyée de Rome\nà la grande poste de Paris, d'où elle est revenue à\nRome, puis ici. Elle vient d'arriver tout essoufflée\nd'une si longue traite. Il me semble, mon petit ami,\nque vous vous donnez assez joUment les violons ; la\nmodestie vous siérait cependant mieux qu'à per-\nsonne. C'est moi qui pourrais en manquer, tandis\nque je mets à Venise la nation française sur un si\ngrand pied que tout franc, je crains qu'un autre ne\npuisse s'y soutenir. Pour vous, on sait assez que vous\nn'êtes l'alné que secwidum quid. Cependant il y au- rait de la dureté à vouloir vous ôter la satisfaction\nde vous louer vous-même sur l'article, puisque vous\n\n===== Page 51 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 213\nne Têtes là -dessus par personne autre. Témoignez,\nje vous prie à ces dames, combien je suis sensible\nà l'empressement qu'elles veulent bien avoir pour\nmes nouvelles. Je me souviens tous les jours d'elles\net avec plaisir. Dans cette commémoration, ma\nbonne amie de Montot tient le premier rang. Ce\nserait bien en vain que l'on courrait le monde pour\ntrouver ailleurs un cœur aussi sensible et aussi vrai,\nune âme plus pure et meilleure, un caractère aussi\négal, aussi sociable, aussi doux; en vérité, je pense\nd'elle ce que l'on a dit d'un homme célèbre qiiil\nfaisait honneur à Ihumanité, Qu'a-t-elle besoin\nd'être d'une aussi jolie figure ? Elle devrait la laisser\nà quelque autre ; elle n'en a que faire pour être uni-\nversellement chérie de tout le monde. Je lui passe\ncependant ses yeux si doux et si fins, parce qu'ils\nsont le plus beau miroir de la plus belle âme qui ait\njamais été. Je suis vraiment affligé qu'elle ait perdu\nson dernier enfant; mais je m'en console, en pensant\nque c'est une perte que l'on peut réparer en deux\nminutes. Au surplus, assurez-les toutes bien fort\nque je persiste opiniâtrément dans la bonne religion,\net que je n'ai point encore, au milieu des infidèles,\nquitté les sentiments orthodoxes, mais je ne réponds\npas de ce que la peur du martyre peut me faire faire\nà Florence. Continuez-moi exactement votre chro-\nnique. S'il n'y a point d'histoire, parbleu ! vous\nvoilà bien en peine, faites-en; moi qui vous parle,\nme mets- je en peine de mentir pour vous amu-\nser?\n\n===== Page 52 =====\n\n214 XVIII.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nJe quitte Dijon, non sans regrets, pour revenir à\nVenise.\nJe voudrais bien pouvoir vous parler savamment\ndu carnaval. On nous presse fort ici d'y revenir pas-\nser ce temps, et l'on nous promet de nous faire voir\nune tout autre Venise ; mais je n'imagine pas que\nnous lui donnions la préférence sur nos affaires et sur\nnos amis. Ce carnaval commence dès le 5 octobre, et\nil y en a un autre petit de quinze jours à l'Ascension ;\nde sorte que l'on peut compter ici environ six mois,\noù qui que ce soit ne va autrement qu'en masque,\nprêtres ou autres, même le nonce et le gardien des\ncapucins. Ne pensez pas que je raille, c'est l'habit\nd'ordonnance ; et les curés seraient, dit-on, mécon-\nnus de leurs paroissiens, l'archevêque de son clergé,\ns'ils n'avaient le masque à la main ou sur le nez. Je\nregrette cette singularité, et encore plus les opéras\net les spectacles du temps. Ce n'est pas que je man-\nque de musique ; il n'y a presque point de soirée\nqu'il n'y ait académie quelque part ; le peuple court\nsur le Canal l'entendre avec autant d'ardeur que si\nc'était pour la première fois. L'affolement de la na-\ntion pour cet art est inconcevable. Vivaldi s'est fait\nde mes amis intimes, pour me vendre des concertos\nbien cher. Il y a en partie réussi, et moi, à ce que je\ndésirais, qui était de l'entendre et d'avoir souvent de\nbonnes récréations musicales : c'est un vecchio qui\na une furie de composition prodigieuse. Je l'ai ouï\nse faire fort de composer un concerto, avec toutes ses\nparties, plus promptement qu'un copiste ne le pourrait\n\n===== Page 53 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 215\ncopier. J'ai trouvé, à mon grand étonnement, qu'il\nn'est pas aussi estimé qu'il le mérite en ce pays-ci,\noù tout est de mode, où l'on entend ses ouvrages de-\npuis trop longtemps, et où la musique de l'année\nprécédente n'est plus de recette. Le fameux Saxon\nest aujourd'hui l'homme fété. Je l'ai ouï chez lui\naussi bien que la célèbre Faustina Bordoni, sa femme,\nqui chante d'un grand goût et d'une légèreté char-\nmante ; mais ce n'est plus une voix neuve. C'est sans\ncontredit la plus complaisante et la meilleure femme\ndu monde, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure chanteuse.\nLa musique transcendante ici est celle des hôpi-\ntaux. Il y en a quatre, tous composés de filles bâtar-\ndes ou orphelines, et de celles que leurs parents ne\nsont pas en état d'élever. Elles sont élevées aux dé-\npens de l'Etat, et on les exerce uniquement à exceller\ndans la musique. Aussi chantent-elles comme des\nanges, et jouent du violon, de la flûte, de l'orgue, du\nhautbois, du violoncelle, du basson ; bref, il n'y a\nsi gros instrument qui puisse leur faire peur. Elles\nsont cloîtrées en façon de religieuses. Ce sont elles\nseules qui exécutent, et chaque concert est composé\nd'une quarantaine de filles. Je vous jure qu'il n'y a\nrien de si plaisant que de voir une jeune et jolie re-\nligieuse, en habit blanc, avec un bouquet de grenades\nsur l'oreille, conduire l'orchestre et battre la mesure\navec toute la grâce et la précision imaginables. Leurs\nvoix sont adorables pour la tournure et la légèreté ;\n* Hasse (Jean-Adolphe) , un des plus célèbres compositeur\ndu xviu' siècle; mort à Venise en 1783. R.

La Zabetta des Incurables est surtout\nétonnante par l'étendue de sa voix et les coups d'ar-\nchet qu'elle a dans le gosier. Pour moi, je ne fais\naucun doute qu'elle n'ait avalé le violon de Somis.\nC'est elle qui enlève tous les suffrages, et ce serait\nvouloir se faire assommer par la populace que d'éga-\nler quelque autre à elle. Mais, écoutez, mes amis, je\ncrois que personne ne nous entend, et je vous dis à\nl'oreille que la Margarita des Mendicanti la vaut\nbien, et me plait davantage.\nCelui des quatre hôpitaux où je vais le plus sou-\nvent, et où je m'amuse le mieux, c'est l'hôpital de la\nPiété ; c'est aussi le premier pour la perfection des\nsymphonies. Quelle roideur d'exécution ! C'est là\nseulement qu'on entend ce premier coup d'archet, si\nfaussement vanté à l'Opéra de Paris.

Groi-\nriez-vous bien que l'espèce de fonction qui se fit en\ndernier lieu le jour de Saint-Barthélemi, et que l'on\nappelle le théâtre de la thériaque, est une chose tout\nà fait amusante ? Toutes les drogues qui entrent dans\ncette composition y sont non-sealement étalées en\nguise de dessert monté , mais encore arrangées avec\nautant d'adresse que de patience ; ce sont des ca-\nmaïeux, des broderies , des paysages et surtout des\nsuites de médailles d'empereurs romains admirables.\nLes vipères y forment des guirlandes et des festons,\net Ton a trouvé le secret de leur donner un air ga-\nlant. Le talent de la nation italienne pour les orne-\nments est exquis; avec une douzaine de nappes\nblanches et autant de mannequins, ils ont façonné en\nun instant autant de statues dignes de Phidias. On\npose cela sur une architecture des trois ordres , de\nmême fabrique ; en vingt-quatre heures , voilà une\néglise parée à ravir pour le jour de sa fête. Je n'ai\npas vu les combats des gondoliers sur les ponts , on\nles a abolis à mon grand regret. En récompense, ils\nont inventé un autre jeu appelé les forces d Hercule,\nUne certaine quantité d'hommes tout nus, se rangent\ndans le Canal en nombre égal, vis-à-vis les uns des\nautres, sur deux lignes ; de petites planches étroites\nportent des deux bouts sur les épaules; d'autres\nhommes montent debout sur ces planches ; un autre\nrang d'hommes sur ceux-ci par la même méthode, I. 13\n\n===== Page 56 =====\n\n218 XVIII.— A M.

Tout\ncela ne parvient pas à bien sans que les planches ne\ncassent souvent, et que la pyramide ou château de\ncartes ne soit dérangée par les fréquentes cascades\ndans Teau. Ce petit jeu, à se rompre le cou, se pra-\ntique quelquefois près du pont de Rialto. Je ne sais\npourquoi on s'extasie si fort en parlant de ce pont ;\non pourrait se contenter de dire qu'il est assez beau.\nIl est vrai qu'il n'y a qu'une arcade ; mais le lieu n'en\nexige pas davantage, et elle n'est pas plus large\nqu'une de celles du pont Saint-Esprit. Il est vrai\naussi qu'il est tout de marbre blanc et fort large ; car\nil y a dessus trois rues et quatre rangs de boutiques,\nà la vérité épaisses comme des lames de couteaux, et\nles rues à l'avenant. Tout cela ne fait pas un tiers en\nsus de la largeur du Pont-Neuf.\nJ'avais annoncé, ce me semble, que je ne dirais\nplus rien de Venise.

J'en suis moins surpris depuis que\nje sais que les religieuses en portent, et que j'ai\nappris qu'une abbesse, aujourd'hui vivante, s'était\njadis battue à coups de poignard contre une autre\ndame, pour l'abbé de Pomponne. L'aventure ne\nlaissa pas de faire quelque éclat, car elle ne s'était\npas passée dans le couvent,\nKAgatinaest la plus splendide de toutes les cour-\ntisanes de Venise. Elle est logée dans un petit palais,\nmeublé superbement, et parée de bijoux comme une\nnymphe.

Il faut des ouvriers extrême-\nment grands et robustes pour travailler à cet ouvrage,\nsurtout pour balancer en l'air ces gros globes de\ncristal qui tiennent à la longue verge de fer qui\nsert à les souffler.\n\n===== Page 59 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 22l\nL'ouvrier prend, dans le creuset du fourneau, une\ngrosse quantité de matière fondue au bout de sa\nverge creuse : cette matière est afors gluante et en\nconsistance dégomme. L'ouvrier, en soufflant, en\nfait un globe creux; puis , à force de le balancer en\nl'air et de le présenter à tout moment à la bouche du\nfourneau , afin d'y entretenir un certain degré de\nfusion, toujours en le tournant fort vite, pour empê-\ncher que la matière présentée au feu ne coule plus\nd'un côté que d'un autre , il parvient à en faire un\nlong ovale. Alors un autre ouvrier, avec la pointe\nd'une paire de ciseaux, faits comme des forces à\ntondre les moutons, c'est-à-dire qui s'élargissent en\nrelâchant la main , perce l'ovale par son extrémité.\nLe premier ouvrier, qui tient la verge à laquelle est\nattaché ce globe , le tourne fort vite tandis que le\nsecond lâche peu à peu la main qui tient les ciseaux.\nDe cette manière l'ovale s'ouvre en entier par l'un\ndes bouts, comme un marli de verre. Alors on le dé-\ntache de la première verge de fer , et on le scelle de\nnouveau, par le bout ouvert, à une autre verge faite\nexprès ; puis on l'ouvre par l'autre bout avec le\nmême mécanisme que celui décrit ci-dessus.

      "content": "On nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand Conseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères, charge assez importante. Le Grand Conseil se tient dans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond est une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et des inquisiteurs d'État, avec le trône du doge au milieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de la salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns aux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle. Tous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se placèrent. Les robes rouges avoient leurs places marquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents lieux de la salle, pour empêcher qu'il ne se fît du bruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée; chose, à mon gré, où ils ne réussirent nullement, puisque l'on y faisoit un sabbat de l'autre monde; aussi ne faisoit-on là que peloter en attendant partie.\n\nPrès du grand chancelier, sur l'estrade, il y avoit une urne contenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avoit de personnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de dorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent celles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en question, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par leurs places, étoient électeurs de droit.\n\nCela fait, nous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin, ornée de la même manière que la première, moins grande, remplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse. Les autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre, saluant jusqu'à terre les précédents, avec une gravité sans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé, le chancelier parut, précédé du corps des secrétaires, gens subalternes, et précédant lui-même le vice-doge; car le doge étoit malade, et c'est le plus vieux des conseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas sur le trône et n'a pas le corno; il l'imitoit tant qu'il pouvoit, ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet de taffetas noir, dont il ramenoit le sommet par devant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable Anténor. Il étoit suivi de tous les conseillers en robes rouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva; il la salua profondément, sans ôter sa barrette que pour la Quarantie criminelle, lorsqu'il passa devant elle. Seul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avoit sur la tête.\n\nIl monta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et autres, se placèrent autour de lui, et sur les ailes le chancelier, à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le chef. Cette assemblée avoit l'air tout à fait majestueux.\n\nAlors le chancelier se leva et dit que les seigneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini demandoient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs parents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédiatement après, les trois avvogadori prirent chacun un petit évangile, et parcoururent les rangs en faisant toucher à chacun cet évangile du bout du doigt, marque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne foi et sans brigue.\n\nTous ces préalables finis, un grand marsouin d'huissier, ayant mis une paire de lunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'étoit davantage, proclama d'un ton nasillard : « Vexcellentissimo signore Luca Priuli. » À l'instant, une vingtaine de petits enfants rouges, comme ceux de l'hôpital, se dispersèrent par la salle, criant comme des perdus : « Priuli ! Priuli ! » Ils avoient chacun à la main une boîte à deux compartiments, l'un blanc pour nommer, l'autre vert pour refuser; l'ouverture commune étant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne puissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on met la main, et à la ceinture une gibecière pleine de petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemisette; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci la mirent dans celle des enchâtres (compartiments) qu'ils voulurent. Les enfants portèrent leurs boîtes au chancelier, qui versa les ballottes des enchâtres blanches dans un bassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les trois autres concurrents; puis on compta les suffrages. Donato fut élu, et nous sortîmes.\n\nTout cela fut fait avec une rapidité surprenante, et en moins de temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris; mais c'étoit une vraie comédie que de voir, en sortant, les prosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice qu'on lui donnoit. D'honneur, ils sonnoient à se faire entendre au milieu de la place.",

      "content": "The invitation had arrived with the morning tide, a discreet note delivered by one of the Ambassador’s liveried gondoliers. “A rare opportunity, Monsieur de Brosses, to witness the heart of the Republic’s governance.” It was the election of the General of the Galleys, a significant charge, as I understood it, overseeing Venice’s naval might, or what remained of it. Such a favour was not to be refused, especially given the Comte de Froulay’s generous hospitality and the general difficulty strangers encountered in penetrating the inner sanctum of Venetian nobility.\n\nMy companion and I, dressed in our most respectable travelling attire, were guided through the labyrinthine passages of the Ducal Palace. The grand staircase, aptly named ‘of the Giants’ with its colossal statues of Mars and Neptune, seemed to dwarf us even further as we ascended, my gaze momentarily caught by the intricate violet and white marble. We were led to the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, an immense chamber, far grander than any royal hall I had seen in France, though perhaps not as finely kept. It was a cavernous space, adorned with monumental canvases depicting Venice’s glorious past, their gilded frames catching the diffused light filtering through high windows. Long rows of benches, upholstered in a faded, rich fabric, stretched across the floor, facing a raised estrade at the far end.\n\nYet, despite the grandeur, the scene was far from solemn. Nobles, a sea of black robes and periwigs, milled about without apparent order, a murmur rising to a cacophony that assaulted the ears. It was, as I later described it, a veritable 'sabbat de l'autre monde'. They jostled, whispered, and gesticulated, their voices echoing off the painted ceilings. Some, distinguished by their scarlet robes, presumably the Sages and more senior Councillors, attempted to impose some semblance of quiet, but their efforts were largely in vain. It seemed the assembly, for all its pomp, was content to engage in lively chatter, like boys at play, awaiting the commencement of a game. I noted several gentlemen engaged in earnest, yet hushed, discussions, their hands frequently reaching for their barrette to emphasize a point, their gazes darting across the room, no doubt weighing alliances and calculating prospects. The air was thick with anticipation, a scent of old wood, beeswax, and the faintest hint of the lagoon’s briny breath.\n\nOur host, the Ambassador, leaned in to offer a whispered explanation of the proceedings. \"First, Monsieur, they must select the electors themselves. A curious custom, to be sure, but one that ensures a certain... unpredictability.\" He gestured towards the estrade where, near the Grand Chancellor, a large, ornate urn stood. It was made of polished bronze, glinting dully in the light, and appeared weighty, almost ancient. A hush, albeit a fragile one, began to fall as the first stage of the election commenced. One by one, or in small groups, the nobles approached the urn. Each reached in, his hand disappearing into the dark maw, to draw forth a small, smooth ball. Most were plain, of white wax or wood, signifying nothing more than participation. But a select few, as I soon observed, were gilded, catching the light as they were withdrawn. Those who drew a golden ball were hailed by their immediate neighbours with quiet nods of congratulation, a slight widening of the eyes, or a subtle, almost imperceptible, smile. These, along with a pre-appointed number of dignitaries who held the right by virtue of their office, would form the electoral college. The process was swift, a practiced ritual, and soon, a distinct group of nobles, now bearing the weight of their temporary office, began to separate themselves from the general throng.\n\nOnce the initial selection was complete, a new sense of purpose settled over the assembly. We were then directed to another, smaller hall, equally well-appointed, though its dimensions lent it a more intimate, and perhaps more serious, atmosphere. This was the Sala dello Scrutinio, where the actual voting would take place. The electors, now a more focused body, entered one by one, each bowing deeply to those already seated, a gesture of profound respect that contrasted sharply with the earlier disorder. Their movements were measured, their expressions grave, as if each step carried the weight of the Republic’s future.\n\nThen, a procession. First, the body of secretaries, men of sober mien in dark robes, their faces etched with the diligence of their office, clearing a path. Following them, with a quiet dignity, came the Grand Chancellor, his presence commanding, his scarlet robe a splash of colour against the prevailing black. And behind him, the Vice-Doge. The true Doge, as we knew, was indisposed, confined to his apartments in the palace. His representative, the eldest of the Councillors, did his utmost to embody the Doge's authority. He wore the black taffeta barrette, pulled forward to a Phrygian point, giving him the appearance of an ancient Antenor, a figure of venerable wisdom. Yet, the absence of the Doge’s distinctive corno, the ducal cap, was a subtle but poignant reminder of his delegated authority. As he passed the seated Quarantia Criminale, he offered a profound bow, and only then, for that brief moment, did his hand move to his barrette, a gesture of deference to that powerful judicial body. He alone, in that entire assembly, wore his head covering throughout.\n\nThe Vice-Doge ascended the estrade and took his place, not on the Doge’s throne, which remained empty, but in the chair adjacent to it. Around him, the Sages, the Grandi, and other high-ranking officials arranged themselves, their rich robes forming a formidable semicircle. On the wings, the Chancellor positioned himself at the head of the secretaries, a silent phalanx of administrative power. The assembly, though smaller than the initial gathering, exuded an undeniable majesty, a quiet strength that spoke volumes of the Republic's enduring institutions.\n\nThe Chancellor rose, his voice clear and resonant, breaking the expectant silence. He formally announced the candidates for the charge of General of the Galleys: \"The most illustrious lords Priuli, Badoar, Donato, and Vendramini seek this office.\" Immediately, a stir went through the hall. Close relatives of each candidate, bound by ancient custom, rose from their seats and quietly exited the chamber. This was a crucial point of Venetian probity, ensuring that no family ties could sway the immediate electoral process. Following this, three Avvogadori della Comune, guardians of the Republic’s laws, each holding a small, leather-bound Gospel, began to circulate among the electors. With solemn faces, they held out the sacred text, and each elector, in turn, touched it with the tip of his finger, swearing an oath to proceed with the election in good faith, free from intrigue or corruption. It was a powerful, symbolic act, a moment of profound commitment amidst the political machinations.\n\nWith the oath administered, the final stage began. A burly usher, whom De Brosses would later comically describe as a \"marsouin\" (porpoise) owing to his stout build and a rather prominent nose, now further exaggerated by a pair of truly monstrous spectacles, stepped forward. In a surprisingly reedy, almost nasal voice, he proclaimed: \"V'excellentissimo signore Luca Priuli!\" At once, the hall erupted, not with shouts from the nobles, but with the shrill, enthusiastic cries of children. A score of young boys, clad in bright red tunics reminiscent of the orphanage uniform, burst into the hall, scattering amongst the electors like a flock of excited sparrows. \"Priuli! Priuli!\" they chanted, their voices echoing with an almost theatrical fervor. Each boy carried a small wooden box, divided into two compartments: one white for \"yes,\" one green for \"no.\" The opening was funnel-shaped, ingeniously designed to prevent anyone from seeing into which compartment an elector placed his hand. From pouches at their belts, they distributed small, smooth ballotte, like shirt buttons, to each noble.\n\nThe electors, with practiced ease, took their ballotte. I watched as they approached the children, their faces impassive, and, with a swift, almost imperceptible movement, dropped their vote into the chosen compartment. There was a quiet intensity to this act, a silent judgment delivered. The red-clad children, once their rounds were complete, returned to the estrade, presenting their boxes to the Chancellor. He, in turn, carefully emptied the ballotte from the white compartments into a large silver basin, discarding the contents of the green. This precise ritual was repeated for each of the other candidates: Badoar, Vendramini, and finally, Donato.\n\nThe counting of the suffrages was swift, a flurry of motion from the secretaries. The Chancellor announced the result with a grave voice: Donato was elected. A wave of murmurs, a mix of satisfaction and disappointment, swept through the hall. As we prepared to depart, the real spectacle began. Donato, the newly elected General, was immediately surrounded by a throng of well-wishers. He bowed, deeply, repeatedly, his body almost touching the floor in exaggerated prosternations. And then came the \"baisers de nourrice\"—loud, smacking kisses planted on his cheeks by his supporters, so resounding that, as De Brosses remarked, they could surely be heard across the Piazza San Marco. It was a theatrical, almost farcical display of congratulations, a vivid coda to the Republic's solemn, yet often boisterous, political theatre. We exited, leaving the triumphant Donato to his embraces, the air still buzzing with the rapid-fire conclusion of this most Venetian of elections.",

Ainsi, non contents d'exalter des gredi-\nneries, ils passent sous silence tout ce qu'il leur en\na coûté pour jouir des choses vraiment curieuses; de\nsorte qu'un pauvre lecteur, n'imaginant que roses\net que fleurs dans le voyage qu'il va entreprendre,\ntrouve souvent à décompter, et se voit précisément\ndans le cas d'un homme qui serait devenu amoureux\nd'une femme borgne, sur son portrait peint de pro-\nfil. Ne croyez pas cependant par là que je veuille\nexagérer les peines du voyage, qui assurément ne\nsont rien moins qu'intolérables. La plus grande de\ntoutes est d'être séparé des gens de sa connaissance ;\nmais je suis bien aise, puisque j'en trouve l'occasion,\nde décharger un peu ma bile contre les détails con-\ntenus dans les livres de voyages que j'ai actuelle-\nment sous les yeux, dans une partie desquels il n'y\na pas un mot de vrai. Il en est de même de la plu-\npart des idées générales que l'on se forme sur le\nbruit public. Par exemple, tout le monde dit : les\nauberges d'Italie sont détestables; cela n'est pas\nvrai, on est très-bien dans les grandes villes. A la\nvérité, on est très- mal dans les villages; ce n'est pas\nmerveille; il en est de même en France. Mais ce\nqu'on ne dit pas, c'est que le pain, non pétri avec\nles bras, mais battu avec de gros bâtons, quoique\nfait avec de la farine blanche et trèis-fine, est la plus\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\n166 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\ndétestable chose dont un homme puisse goûter; j'en\nsuis désolé. Pour le vin, je m'y fais tant bien que\nmal, en choisissant toujours celui qui est gros et fort\nâpre, par préférence au doux, qui ne peut être com-\nparé qu'au pain, tant il est mauvais. Cependant les\ngens du pays le trouvent exquisissime, et c'est une\nchose à crever de rire que de voiries mines que font\nles dames en goûtant de nos vins de Champagne, et\ncombien elles sont émerveillées de m'en voir avaler\nde grands traits mousseux.\nOn dit encore qu'on a tant qu'on veut la cambia-\ntura; fausseté. Les surintendants des postes la don-\nnent très-diffîcilement, et il faut avoir à chaque\nposte des discussions qui ne finissent point. Le résul-\ntat de tout cela, c'est qu'il faut payer la poste ex-\ncessivement cher, et compter toujours, quand on a\ndestmé une certaine somme à ce voyage-ci, qu'on\ndépensera le triple, encore que notre argent gagne\nen Italie; car, outre Tarticle de la poste et des voitu-\nrins qui sont d'abominables canailles, il y a celui des\nauberges plus chères qu'en France, quoiqu'on ne\nsoupe jamais, et celui que l'on appelle la hiiona man-\ncia, comme nous dirions la bonne main. Ce point ne\nfinit pas ; pour la plus petite chose vous êtes entouré\nde gens qui vous demandent pour boire ; même un\nhomme avec qui on a fait un marché d'un louis trou-\nverait fort singulier, après Fexécution, qu'on ne lui\ndonnât qu'un écu de bonne main. Je m'en plains\n' tous les jours aux gens du pays, qui se contentent de\nplier les épaules en disant : Poveri forestieri c'est-\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 167\nà-dire en langue vulgaire, les étrangers sont faits\npour être volés. Quand j'aurai un peu plus de pra-\ntique de la langue du pays, je mettrai bon ordre à\nce que cela n'arrive plus. Enfin, je ne finirais pas,\nsi je voulais blâmer toutes les erreurs où Ton est sur\nce voyage, et qui ne sont pas mieux fondées que la\njalousie des Italiens, ou la captivité de leurs femmes ;\nmais cette préface n'est déjà que trop longue. Re-\ntournons à nos moutons, c'est-à-dire à notre journal,\nà condition cependant que vous ne le communique-\nrez qu'à peu de personnes ; quand ce seront des gens\ndiscrets comme Bourbonne ou Courtois; mais je\ndéfends les causeurs, à commencer par votre frère.\nJe ne sais si je vous ai conté comment nous par-\ntîmes de Padoue , le 28 du mois dernier. Ce fut eii\nnous embarquant sur le canal de la Brenta, avec lin\nvent contraire; c'est la règle. Mais pour le coup, le\ndiable en fut la dupe, car nous avions de bons che-\nvaux qui nous remorquaient le long du bord, moyen-\nnant quoi nous ingannions le sortilège qui nous\npoursuit. Le bâtiment que nous montions se nomme\nle Bucentaure. Vous pouvez bien penser que ce n'est\nqu'un fort petit enfant du vrai Bucentaure; mais\naussi c'était le plus joli enfant du monde, ressem-\nblant fort en beau à nos diligences d'eau, et infini-\nment plus propre, composé d'une petite antichambre\npour les valets, suivie d'une chambre tapissée de\nbrocatelle de Venise, avec une table et deux estrades\ngarnies de maroquin et ouverte de huit croisées\neffectives et de deux portes vitrées. Nous trouvions\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nm XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY,\nnotre domicile si agréable et si commode, que,\ncontre notre ordinaire, nous n'avions nulle impa-\n• tience d'arriver, d'autant mieux que nous nous étions\nmunis de force vivres, vin de Canarie, etc. ; et que\nles rivages sont bordés de quantité de belles maisons\nde nobles vénitiens. Celle de Pisani, maintenant\ndoge, mérite en vérité une description particulière ,\nsurtout par un portail de jardin au bord de l'eau\naccompagné de deux colonnes qui ont des escaliers\ntournants de fer en dehors, montant sur une terrasse\ncharmante, qui fait le comble du péristyle. Cela est\nimaginé à merveille, et l'on m'a dit depuis que le\ncardinal de Rohan en avait fait prendre le dessin\npour l'exécuter à Saverne. Nous voulions d'abord\ndescendre pour voir ces maisons; le nombre nous\nen rebuta : c'aurait été l'affaire de quelques années.\nCependant nous ne résistâmes pas à la tentation de\nvoir la dernière, qui est sur la route, appartenant\naux Foscarini ; elle a beaucoup de bonnes fresques,\net surtout une Chute des Titans, d'une excellente ex-\npression, de la main de Zelotti. (Notez cependant\nque ceci est encore inférieur aux abords de Gênes.)\nAu bout de quelques milles nous eûmes l'honneur\nd'entrer dans la mer Adriatique , et peu après celui\nd'apercevoir Venise.\nA vous dire vrai , l'abord de cette ville ne me sur-\nprit pas autant que je m'y attendais. Cela ne me fit\npas un autre effet que la vue d'une place située au\nbord de la mer, et Tentrée par le Grand-Canal fut,\nà mon gré, celle de Lyon ou de Paris, par la rivière,\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 169\nMais aussi quand on y est une fois, qu'on voit sortir\nde l'eau de tous côtés des palais, des églises, des\nrues, des villes entières, car il n'y en a pas pour une;\nenfin, de ne pouvoir faire un pas par une ville sans\navoir le pied dans la mer, c'est une chose à mon gré\nsi surprenante, qu'aujourd'hui j'y suis moins fait que\nle premier jour, aussi bien qu'à voir cette ville\nouverte de tous côtés, sans portes, sans fortifications\net sans un seul soldat de garnison, imprenable par\nmer ainsi que parterre; car les vaisseaux de guerre\nn'en peuvent nullement approcher , à cause des la-\ngunes trop basses pour les porter. En un mot, cette\nville-ci est si singulière par sa disposition, ses façons,\nses manières de vivre à faire crever de rire , la li-\nberté qui y règne et la tranquillité qu'on y goûte ,\nque je n'hésite pas à la regarder comme la seconde\nville de l'Europe, et je doute que Rome me fasse re- venir de ce sentiment.\nNous sommes logés, pour ainsi dire, dans le fort\nde la rue Saint-Honoré ; avec cela on peut dormir la\ngrasse matinée sans être interrompu par le moindre\nbruit. Tout s'y passe doucement dans l'eau , et je\ncrois que l'on ronflerait fort bien au milieu du mar-\nché aux herbes. Joignez à cela qu'il n'y a pas dans\nle monde une voiture comparable aux gondoles pour\nla commodité et l'agrément. Je ne trouve pas que\nl'on en ait donné à mon gré une description juste.\nC'est un bâtiment long et étroit comme un poisson ,\nà peu près comme un requin ; au milieu est posée\nune espèce de caisse de carrosse, basse, faite en ber-\n1. . 10\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\n170 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nlingot, et du double plus longue qu'un vis-à-vis : il\nn'y a qu'une seule portière au-devant, par où l'on\nentre. Il y a place pour deux dans le fond , et pour\ndeux autres de chaque côté sur une banquette qui y\nrègne , mais qui ne sert presque jamais que pour\nétendre les pieds de ceux qui sont dans le fond. Tout\ncela est ouvert de trois côtés , comme nos carrosses ,\net se ferme quand on veut , soit par des glaces , soit\npar des panneaux de bois recouverts de drap noir ,\nqu'on fait glisser sur des coulisses, ou rentrer par le\ncôté dans le corps de la gondole. Je ne sais pas trop\nsi je me fais entendre. Le bec d'avant de la gondole\nest armé d'un grand fer en col de grue, garni de six\nlarges dents de fer. Cela sert à la tenir en équilibre,\net je compare ce bc à la gueule ouverte du requin,\nbien que cela y ressemble comme à un moulin à\nveut. Tout le bateau est peint en noir et verni ; la\ncaisse doublée de velours noir en dedans et de drap\nnoir en dehors , avec les coussins de maroquin de\nmême couleur, sans qu'il soit permis aux plus grands\nseigneurs d'en avoir une différente, en quoi que ce\nsoit, de celle du plus petit particulier ; de sorte qu'il\nne faut pas songer à deviner qui peut être dans une\ngondole fermée. On est là comme dans sa chambre,\nà lire, écrire, converser, caresser sa maltresse, man--\nger, boire, etc., toujours faisant des visites par la\nville. Deux hommes , d'une fidélité à toute épreuve,\nl'un à l'avant, l'autre à l'arrière, vous conduisent\nsans vous voir, si vous ne voulez.\nJe n'espère plus de me retrouver de sang-froid\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 171\ndans un carrosse, après avoir tkié de ceci. J'avais\nouï dire qu'il n'y avait jamais d'embarras de gon-\ndoles , comme il y en a de voitures à Paris ; mais au\ncontraire rien n'est plus commun , surtout dans les\nrues étroites et sous les ponts ; à la vérité ils sont de\npeu de durée, la flexibilité de l'eau donne une\ngrande facilité pour s'en débarrasser. Outre cela, nos\ncochers d'ici sont si adroits, qu'ils glissent on ne sait\ncomfnent, et tournent en un coup de main cette lon-\ngissime machine , sur la pointe d'une aiguille. Ces\nvoitures vont vite , mais non pas autant que le car-\nrosse d'un petit maître. Cependant ne vous avisez\npas de tenir la tète hors de votre gondole ; la gueule\ndu requin d'une autre gondole qui passerait vous la\ncouperait net comme un navet. Le nombre des gon-\ndoles est infini , et l'on ne compte pas moins de\nsoixante mille personnes qui vivent de la rame , soit\ngondoliers ou autres. On dit aussi, pour faire valoir\nl'agrément du séjour, que la ville a toujours un fonds\nde trente mille étrangers. Cela peut avoir quelque\nfondement pendant les six mois de carnaval ; mais\nhors de là, je crois ce nombre fort exagéré.\nVous croyez peut-être que la place Saint-Marc ,\ndont on parle tant, est aussi grande que d'ici à de-\nmain. Rien moins que cela ; elle est fort au-dessous,\ntant pour la grandeur que pour le coup d'œil des\nbâtiments de la place Vendôme , bien que magnifi-\nquement bâtie ; mais elle est régulière , carrée ,\nlongue , terminée des deux bouts par les éghses de\nSaint-Marc et de San-Geminiano, et des côtés par\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\n111 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nles Procuraties Vieilles et Neuves. Ces dernières for-\nment un magnifique bâtiment, tout d'un corps de\nlogis d'une très-grande longueur, orné d'architec-\nture, et le comble couvert de statues. Tant les Neuves\nque les Vieilles sont bâties sur des arcades, sous les-\nquelles on se promène à couvert, et chaque arcade\nsert d'entrée à un café qui ne désemplit point. La\nplace est pavée de pierres de taille. On ne peut s'y\ntourner, à ce qu'on dit, pendant le carnaval, à cause\nde la quantité de masques et de théâtres. Pour moi ,\nqui n'ai pas vu cela, je l'en trouve actuellement tou-\njours pleine. Les robes de palais, les manteaux, les\nrobes de chambre, les Turcs, le Grecs, lesDalmates,\nles Levantins de toute espèce, hommes et femmes ,\nles tréteaux de vendeurs d'orviétan , de bateleurs ,\nde moines qui prêchent , et de marionnettes ; tout\ncela, dis-je , qui y est tout ensemble , à toute heure,\nla rendent la plus belle et la plus curieuse place du\nmonde , surtout par le retour d'équerre qu'elle fait\nauprès de Saint- Marc, ce que l'on nomme Broglio.\nC'est une autre place plus petite que la première ,\nformée par le palais Saint-Marc et le retour du bâti-\nment des Procuraties-Neuves. La mer, large en cet\nendroit, la termine. C'est de là qu'on voit le mélange\ndéterre, de mer, de gondoles, de boutiques, de\nvaisseaux et d'églises , de gens qui partent et qui\narrivent à chaque instant. J'y vais au moins quatre\nfois le jour pour me régaler la vue. Les nobles ont\nleur côté où ils se promènent , et qu'on leur laisse\ntoujours libre ; c'est lâ qu'ils trament toutes leurs in-\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 173\ntrigues, d'où est venu à cette place le nom de Bro-\ng Ho, La grande place a dans un angle la haute tour\nde Saint- Marc, qui, quoique grande et bien faite ,\nme parait assez mal placée là, puisqu'elle interrompt\nla figure régulière de la place\nJe ne m'aviserai pas d'entrer avec vous dans le\nmême détail sur l'article de Venise que j'ai fait en\nparlant des autres villes; ce serait une chose à ne\njamais finir, et pour plus d'abréviation, je ne vous\nen dirai rien du tout, d'autant rnieux que je n'au-\nrais souvent qu'à répéter ce qu'a dit Misson. Il en\nparle fort pertinemment, et mieux que d'aucun autre\nendroitquej'aie encore vu ; surtout je vous épargnerai\nl'article des tableaux, à votre grande satisfaction, si\nje ne me trompe ; mais je ne ferai pas le même tort à\nQuintin, qui ne me le pardonnerait pas. On dit qu'il\ny en a plus à Venise que dans le reste de l'Italie.\nPour moi, ce que j'assurerai bien, c'est qu'il y en a\nplus que dans la France entière. La seule liste des\npeintures publiques fait un gros in-8% sans compter\nque les particuliers en ont de quoi combler l'Océan.\nOn prétend aussi, qu'à illuminer les trois étages des Procuraties en flambeaux de cire blanche la nuit de\nNoël, on brûle plus de cire ici en cette nuit que dans\ntout le reste de l'Italie pendant un an. Nous ne son-\ngeons jamais à déjeuner, Sainte-Palaye et moi, sans\nnous être au préalable mis quatre tableaux du Titien\net deux plafonds de Paul Véronèse sur la conscience.\n' Elle a été élevée, au controire, pour masquer son irrégnla- lilé.

Je me suis borné à examiner mille ou douze\ncents des principaux \\\nJe ne vous parlerai pas trop non plus du gouver-\nnement ni des mœurs ; c'est un article qu' Amelot a\ntraité à fond, et assez bien. Il ne faut pas cepen-\ndant croire tout le mal qu'il en dit, mais seulement\nla plus grande partie. Quant aux mœurs, vous aime-\nriez sûrement mieux que je vous entretinsse de cela\nque d'édifices et de peintures ; mais faites réflexion\nqu'un étranger qui passe un mois dans une ville\nn'est pas fait pour les connaître, et en parlerait pres-\nque infailliblement tout de travers. Cependant, si\nvous voulez quelque chose là-dessus, je vous dirai\nqu'il n'y a pas de lieu au monde où la liberté et la\nlicence régnent plus souverainement qu'ici. Ne vous\nmêlez pas du gouvernement, et faites d'ailleurs tout\nce que vous voudrez. Je ne parle pas de la chose\ndont nos plaisirs et nous tirons notre origine, de la\nchose proprement dite par excellence. On ne s'en\nchoque pas plus ici que de toute autre opération na-\nturelle. C'est une bonne police qui devrait être reçue\npartout. Mais, pour tout ce qui, en saine morale,\ndoit s'appeler méchante action, l'impunité y est en-\n1 Venise alors était peut-être la ville du monde où les peintres\neussent le plus de facililé pour voir et étudier la figure Lumaine.\nIls trouvaient habituellement , dans deux académies, de beaux\nmodèles, de l'un et de l'autre sexe, qu'ils avaient la faculté de posait selon les exigences de leur tableau. R. C.\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 175\ntière. Cependant le sang est si doux ici, que, malgré\nla facilité que donnent les masques, les allures de\nnuit, les rues étroites et surtout les ponts sans garde-\nfous, d'où l'on peut pousser un homme dans la mer\nsans qu'il s'en aperçoive, il n'arrive pas quatre acci-\ndents par an; encore n'est-ce qu'entre étrangers.\nVous pouvez juger par là combien les idées que l'on\na sur les stylets vénitiens sont mal fondées aujour-\nd'hui.\nIl en est à peu près de même de leur jalousie pour\nleurs femmes : cependant cela mérite explication.\nDès qu'une fille, entre nobles, est promise, elle met\nun masque, et personne ne la voit plus que son fu-\ntur, ou ceux à qui il le permet, ce qui est fort rare.\nEn se mariant, elle devient un meuble de commu-\nnauté pour toute la famille, chose assez bien imagi-\nnée, puisque cela supprime l'embarras de la précau-\ntion, et que l'on est sûr d'avoir des héritiers du sang.\nC'est souvent l'apanage du cadet de porter le nom\nde mari ; mais, outre cela, il est de règle qu'il y ait\nun amant; ce serait même une espèce de déshonneur\nà une femme si elle n'avait pas un homme publique-\nment sur son compte. Mais, halte là; la politique a\ntrès-grande part à ceci. La famille en use comme le\nroi de France à l'élection de l'abbé de Clteaux ; on\nlaisse choisir la femme en donnant l'exclusion à tels\nou tels. Il ne faut pas qu'elle s'avise de prendre au-\ncun autre qu'un noble, et parmi ceux-ci, un homme\nqui ait entrée dans le Pregadi ou Sénat et dans les\nconseils, dont la famille soit assez puissante pour\n\n===== Page 14 =====\n\n176 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\npouvoir favoriser les brigues, et à qui l'on puisse\ndire : Monsieur, il me faut demain matin tant de voix\npour mon beau-frère ou pour mon mari. Avec cela,\nune femme a la liberté tout entière, et peut faire\ntout ce qu'elle veut. Il faut cependant rendre justice\nà la vérité ; notre ambassadeur me disait, l'autre\njour, qu'il ne connaissait pas plus d'une cinquan-\ntaine de femmes de qualité qui couchassent avec leurs\namants. Le reste est retenu par la dévotion. Les con-\nfesseurs ont traité avec elles, qu'elles s'abstiendraient\nde l'article essentiel; moyennant quoi, ils leur font\nbon marché du reste tout aussi loin qu'il puisse s'é- tendre.\nVoilà quel est le train courant de la galanterie, où\nles étrangers n'ont pas beau jeu. Les nobles ne les\nadmettent guère ni dans leurs maisons ni dans leurs\nparties. Hs veulent vivre entre eux, et avoir leurs\ncoudées franches, pour parler devant leurs femmes,\nde brigues et de ballottages, articles sur lesquels le\ntacet s'observe exactementdevant l'étranger. Cepen-\ndant, lorsque deux personnes s'entendent, il n'est\npas impossible de faire un coup fourré à la faveur des\ngondoles, où les dames entrent toujours seules sans\nsurveillants; c'est un asile sacré. Il est inouï qu'un\ngondolier de Madame se soit laissé gagner par Mon-\nsieur ; il serait noyé le lendemain par ses camarades.\nCette pratique actuelle des dames a beaucoup dimi-\nnué les profits des religieuses, qui étaient jadis en\npossession de la galanterie. Cependant il y en a en-\ncore bon nombre qui s'en tirent aujourd'hui avec\n\n===== Page 15 =====\n\nSÉJOUR ENISE. 177\ndistinction, je pourrais dire avec émulation ; puisque,\nactuellement que je vous parle, il y a une furieuse\nbrigue entre trois couvents de la ville, pour savoir\nlequel aura l'avantage de donner une maîtresse au\nnouveau nonce qui vient d'arriver. En vérité, ce se-\nrait du côté des religieuses que je me tournerais le\nplus volontiers, si j'avais un long séjour à faire ici.\nToutes celles que j'ai vues à la messe, au travers de\nla grille, causer (ant qu'elle durait et rire ensemble,\nm'ont paru jolies au possible et mises de manière à\nfaire bien valoir leur beauté. Elles ont une petite\ncoiffure charmante, un habit simple, mais bien en<\ntendu, presque toujours blanc, qui leur découvre les\népaules et la gorge, ni plus ni moins que les habits à\nla romaine de nos comédiennes.\nPour épuiser l'article du sexe féminin il convient\nici plus qu'ailleurs de vous dire un mot de5 courti-\nsanes. Elles composent un corps vraiment respecta-\nble par les bons procédés. Il ne faut pas croire en-\ncore, comme on le dit, que le nombre en soit si grand\nque l'on marche dessus ; cela n'a lieu que pendant le\ntemps de carnaval, où l'on trouve sous les arcades des\nProcuraties autant de femmes couchées que debout ;\nhors de là, leur nombre ne s'étend pas à plus du dou-\nble de ce qu'il y en a à Paris ; mais aussi elles sont\nfort employées. Tous les jours régulièrement à vingt-\nquatre ou vingt-quatre heures et demie au plus tard,\ntoutes sont occupées. Tant pis pour ceux qui viennent\ntrop tard. A la différence de celles de Paris, toutes\nsont d'une douceur d'esprit et d'une politesse char*\n\n===== Page 16 =====\n\n178 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nmantes. Quoi que vous leur demandiez, leur -réponse\nest toujours : Sarà servito, sono a suoi commandi\n(car il est de la civilité de ne parler jamais aux gens\nqu'à la troisième personne.) A la vérité, vu la répu-\ntation dont elles jouissent, les demandes qu'on leur\nfait ordinairement sont fort bornées ; cependant j'en\ntrouvai l'autre jour une si jolie qu xxxx Le moyen\nde ne pas s'y fier, elle me répondait des conséquences\nper la beatissima madonna di Loreto.\nNous avons eu quelque peine à nous mettre un peu\ndans le beau monde ; nous sommes arrivés dans des\ncirconstances défavorables. La sérénissime républi-\nque venait de faire main basse sur près de cinq cents\ncourtiers d'amour qui, abusant de leur ministère\npublic, s'en allaient offrir à tous venants, sur la place\nSaint-Marc, madame la procuratesse celle-ci, ou ma-\ndame la chevalière celle-là ; de sorte qu'il arrivait\nquelquefois à un mari de s'entendre proposer sa\nfemme. On a réformé cette licence trompeuse et in-\nsolente. Néanmoins il ne faut pas être en peine de\nvivre aujourd'hui, pour peu qu'on choisisse bien ses\ngondoliers, et ce choix est si aisé, qu il faut être d'un\ngrand guignon pour le faire mal. Il vient de m'arri-\nver à ce sujet une plaisante aventure, qui m'a mis\npour un moment dans un embarras fort risible.\nJ'avais envoyé hier un gondolier faire Vambasciata\nà la célèbre Bagatina. Le rendez-vous était pris chez\nelle à une heure marquée. Je ne la trouvai point ; sa\nfemme de chambre me dit qu'elle avait été obligée\nde sortir avec une dame de ses amies, pour aller à la\n\n===== Page 17 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 179\nconversation chez je ne sais quel seigneur, et qu'elle\nm'en faisait excuse, me priant de revenir le lende-\nmain. Pendant ce discours, j'examinais un apparte-\nment vaste, magnifique, richement orné, et parais-\nsant fort au-dessus de l'état d'une pareille princesse.\nJe demandai à la femme de chambre si un tel gon-\ndolier n'était pas venu de ma part parler à la Baga-\ntina. Elle me répondit que le gondolier était venu\nen effet ; mais que sa maltresse ne s'appelait point\nBagatina, mais bien Abbati Marcheze, et qu'elle était\nla femme d'un noble vénitien. Mais, lai ai-je dit,\nqu'est-ce que votre maîtresse a pensé que je voulais\nd'elle ? Que vous aviez quelque lettre de recomman-\ndation à lui remettre, a-t-elle repris. Vous êtes le\nmaître, monsieur, de me la laisser ou de revenir de-\nmain, si cela vous plaît. Là-dessus j'ai fait monter le\ngondolier ; la soubrette et lui ont persisté en leur\ndire, chacun de leur côté. Le gondolier a été traité\nde birbante et de ladite ; et j'ai été congédié avec\nforce révérences, assez incertain si je retournerais le\nlendemain, et de ce que pouvait signifier un pareil\nquiproquo. Enfin je me suis déterminé à risquer le\npaquet, et j'y suis retourné aujourd'hui. J'ai trouvé\nune grande femme bien faite, d'environ trente-cinq\nans, de grand air, d'un bon maintien, magnifique-\nment vêtue et chargée de pierreries, qui, s'avançant\nà moi d'un air très-grave, m'a demandé ce que je\nsouhaitais d'elle. Je le savais assez, et mon embarras\nne roulait que sur la manière de le lui dire. Je lui ai\nbaragouiné un compliment inintelligible dans le plus\n\n===== Page 18 =====\n\n180 Xiy.— À M. DE BLANCEY.\nmauvais italien que j'ai pu, et cela ne m'est pas dif-\nficile. Enfin, s'aperce vaut de ce qui causait mon in-\ncertitude, elle a eu le bon procédé de la lever elle-\nmême au bout d'un instant, en quittant son faux nom\net sa fausse décence \\ Elle a même eu l'air surpris de\nma libéralité ; car, en faveur du meuble et de l'ha-\nbillement, j'ai doublé les sequins, ne voulant pas avoir rien mis de médiocre dans une main ornée de\ndiamants. Les nobles, j'entends ceux qui ne sont pas\nd'un goût plus raffiné, font grand usage de ces prin-\ncesses. Quand l'un d'eux veut faire une partie de\npromenade avec la sienne, elle vient tout uniment le\nprendre dans sa gondole au sortir du conseil, et l'on\nn'est pas plus surpris de l'y voir monter avec elle en\npleine place Saint-Marc qu'on ne l'a été, en temps\nde carnaval, de voir ce noble ôter son masque et son\ndomino dans l'antichambre du Conseil, pour y en-\ntrer. Ma foi ! ils ont raison, c'est un doux séjour de\njouissance qu'une gondole. Au surplus, ne croyez\npas que, malgré la fidélité dont elles se piquent pour\nleurs tenants, elles soient inaccessibles. Ce scrupule\nne dure jamais que cinq jours de la semaine ; leurs\namants mêmes leur laissent presque toujours toute\nliberté le vendredi, parce qu'ils font leurs dévotions,\net le samedi, parce qu'ils ont affaire au Pregadi.\nElles ont un usage politique assez bien trouvé, c'est\n* E poi che la sua mono alla mia pose\nCou lieto volto, onde mi conforiai ,\nMi mise flintro aile segrete rose.\nDantk.\n\n===== Page 19 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 181\nde ne rien accorder qu'à la seconde entrevue, parce\nque, disent-elles, il faut connaître avant que d'aimer.\nAu moyen de ce, on leur fait au moins deux visites,\net elles reçoivent des appointements doubles pour\nun seul service. Je crois que voilà un chapitre traité\nà fond. Je l'ai fait de la sorte en votre faveur, parce\nque je sais que vous êtes fort vicieux, et afin que vous\nn'ayez rien à désirer, j'ajouterai que les femmes sont\nplus belles ici qu'en aucun autre endroit, surtout\nparmi le peuple. Ce n'est pas qu'on y trouve plus\nqu'ailleurs des beautés ravissantes ; mais communé-\nment le grand nombre est joli et en général elles ont\ntoutes la taille et le teint beaux, la bouche grande et\nagréable, les dents blanches et bien rangées.\nXV. — A M. DE NEUILLY.\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n0 août.\nLa noblesse de Venise est, si je ne me trompe, la\nplus ancienne de l'Europe (j'entends les premières\nmaisons), puisqu'il en subsiste plusieurs de celles qui\nélurent le premier doge, il y a plus de treize cents ans.\nIls ont, tant dans l'ancienne que dans la moderne\nnoblesse, entre laquelle, par parenthèse, il n'y a\npoint de différence comme à Gênes, beaucoup de\nfamilles puissamment riches ; bien entendu que la\nrépublique met bon ordre à ce qu'elles ne le devien- I. 11\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\n182 XV. -A M. DE NEUILLY.\nlient pas trop. Par exemple, en dernier lieu, la\nPisani, héritière de 150,000 ducats de rente, vou-\nlait se marier à un homme de son nom presque\naussi riche qu'elle ; non -seulement l'Etat le lui a\ndéfendu, mais il l'a obligée d'en épouser un autre\nqui n'avait rien. Cette noblesse se perpétue sûre-\nment, et prouve sa descendance par le repristre\nappelé le Livre dor où l'on inscrit tous les nobles\nqui naissent ; ceux qui auraient omis de s'y faire\ninscrire ne seraient pas nobles; aussi y a-t-il des\ncitadins qui, quoique petits bourgeois, sont de la\nplus ancienne noblesse; ce qui vient de ce qu'en\non ferma tout d'un coup le Livre d'or , moyennant\nquoi il n'y a eu que ceux qui y étaient inscrits alors et\nleurs descendants qui ont été nobles. Tous ceux qui\navaient négligé de s'y faire inscrire furent exclus,\net n'ont pas aujourd'hui plus de prérogatives que\nles autres citadins* Ce n'est pas beaucoup dire assu-\nrément, car cet ordre est assez mal mené par le\ngouvernement, et plus encore les gentilshommes\nde terre ferme. En récompense, le menu peuple\nest traité avec une extrême douceur; la raison de\nces deux points de politique n'est pas difficile à deviner.\n' Les nobles portent pour habillement un jupon de\n1 La noblesse devenant de jour en jour plus pauvre, le sénat\nfut contraint, en 1775, de rouvrir \\e Livre d'or. C'est un moyen\ndont on s'était déjà servi plusieurs fois, afin de donner à ce corps\ndes membres opulents, et d'augmenter le trésor de la république. R.

Quelques-\nuns de ceux qui sont en dignité la portent rouge,\nd'autres violette. Tous portent sur l'épaule une aune\nde drap de couleur assortissante, placée dans la vraie\nposition de la serviette d'un maître d'hôtel et sont\ncoiffés d'une perruque si démesurée, qu'en vérité\ncelle de M. Bernardon n'est plus qu'un toquet. Ils\nportent à la main une barrette de drap ou de taffetas\nnoir, faite comme nos coiffes de bonnets de nuit. La\nmanche de la robe fait encore une distinction ; plus\nla dignité est grande, plus la manclie est large (et\ncette manche n'est pas inutile pour mettre la provi-\nsion de boucherie avec une salade dans le grand\nbonnet). La manche du doge, comme de raison,\nexcède le panier d'une femme : elle est de drap d'or,\nainsi que la robe. La façon la plus humble de saluer\nles nobles est d'aller solliciter au BrogliOj et de\nbaiser la manche de celui qu'on sollicite. L'art des\nrévérences est encore un grand point : il faut les\nfaire bas, bas ; encore n'en fait-on aucun compte si\nla perruque ne traîne pas à terre d'un bon demi-\npied. Le manteau est un habillement plus commun\nencore que la robe. Tout homme qui, par son état,\nest au-dessus de l'artisan, est moins dispensé de le\nporter quand il sort, quelque chaud qu'il fasse, que\nnous ne le sommes de porter une culotte ; mais\naussi, comme chez nos femmes qui sont revenues\n\n===== Page 22 =====\n\n184 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\ndu monde, c'est-à-dire dont le monde est revenu,\nle manteau de la dévotion couvre tout. Ici le simple\nmanteau de bouracan fait le même effet. On porte\ndessous tout ce qu'on veut, et vous ne trouverez\nautre chose à la messe ou dans la place que des gens\nen pantoufles et en robe de chambre avec leur man-\nteau par-dessus. Les nobles le portent quand ils\nn'ont pas leur robe, et alors ils sont censés être\nincognito par les rues; mais, comme dit Trajano\nBoccalini : ce II manto délia religione non è in questo\ntanto lungo, che spesse volte non si vedano per di\nsotto due palme di gambe di ladro. » C'est aussi\ndans cet équipage qu'ils vont souvent le soir aux\nassemblées; surtout on ne doit point le quitter; il\nfaut, ribonfredon, faire sa partie de quadrille d'un bout à Tautre en manteau, et étouffer avec décence.\nJ'ai vu le vieux bonhomme doge Pisani prendre Tair\nsur le perron d'un casino dans cet habillement, avec\nune petite perruque bardachine. Il avait tout à fait\nl'air d'un jouvenceau; à la vérité il était malade\nalors et prenait l'air pour sa santé.\n(est une chose originale et bien occupante pour\nles nobles que l'intrigue de leur Broglio, Il y a des\ndessous de cartes admirables. On vient de me con-\nter le détail d'une aventure arrivée en dernier lieu,\nqui fait du bruit ici ; c'est à mon avis un bon conte.\nMonsieur ilfaut que je vous en fasse récit, sans vous\ngarantir les circonstances , quoique je les tienne\nd'un des ambassadeurs qui sont ici; mais vous\nn'ignorez pas jusqu'à quel point je pousse le scru-\n\n===== Page 23 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 185\npule de la fidélité historique, et que je suis incapable\nde rien assurer, même dans mon histoire des ancien-\nnes dynasties assyriennes, dont je n'aie été moi-même\nle témoin oculaire. Il faut donc que vous sachiez\nque le procurateur Tiepolo , à qui nous sommes\nrecommandés ici, et le procureur Aimo sont deux\npersonnages d'une grande autorité dans l'Etat et\nfort antagonistes l'un de l'autre. Le premier, qui est\nde la plus haute noblesse, a grand crédit dans le\nSénat, et l'autre, qui n'est pas si distingué par sa\nnaissance, a plus de pouvoir dans le Grand-Conseil,\nparce que c'est l'assemblée générale des nobles.\nC'est le Sénat qui nomme aux charges ; mais il faut\nque le Grand-Conseil confirme l'élection, sans quoi\nelle est nulle. 11 y a quelque temps que Tiepolo bri-\nguait une place dans le conseil des Dix, et Aimo, ne\nsachant comment le faire rejeter, prit le biais, sous\nprétexte de bonne manière, de faire d'abord nommer\nun autre Tiepolo, bonhomme qui ne songeait à rien,\net à qui certainement on aurait encore moins songé.\nLe procurateur Tiepolo fut fort sensible à cette poli-\ntesse, et retira ses cornes, parce que la loi ne permet\npas qu'il y ait deux personnes du même nom dans\nle conseil des Dix ; mais il jura bien de rendre à\nl'autre sa galanterie. Pour cet effet il fit nommer le\nfrère d'Aimo, personnage qui avait passé dans les\nplus grandes charges, podestat de Vicence. C'est\nune place que l'on donne aux commençants âgés de\nvingt ans, et c'est à peu près comme si Ton faisait\nle premier président avocat du roi au Châtelet.\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\n186 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nAimo le cadet cria comme un enragé, que c'était\nune berne, et qu'il n'y voulait point aller. Il eut\nbeau jurer, il fallut payer l'amende de 1,000 ducats,\nréglée contre ceux qui refusent des magistratures,\net aller en exil pour un an. Il revint d'un grand\nsang-froid au bout de l'année; mais le narquois de\nTiepolo l'attendait à l'affût et le fit nommer podestat\nde Padoue. La récidive est un peu plus chère ; elle\ncoûte 2,000 ducats et deux années de bannissement.\nAimo, pénétré de douleur, s'en allait chercher l'ar-\ngent chez lui, quand son frère le procurateur l'ar-\nrêta, lui fit entendre que ces plaisanteries-là ne fini-\nraient point et qu'il fallait qu'il allât à Padoue, lui\ndonnant sa parole que dans six mois il le ferait nom-\nmer provéditeur général de la mer, qui est une des\nplus grandes charges de l'Etat. En effet, cette place\na été vacante dans ce temps. Nous venions alors d'ar-\nriver. Aimo l'a publiquement briguée pour son frère,\net ïiepolo lui a donné pour compétiteur Loredano,\nhomme d'une grande distinction. Vous autres, bon-\nnes gens, auriez cru qu'il allait tout uniment faire\nnommer Loredano au Sénat, où sa faction était pré-\ndominante; nullement, cette voie est trop simple\npour ces gens-ci, et de plus le Grand-Conseil aurait\nbien pu détruire son ouvrage. Le biais qu'il prit fut\nau contraire de faire refuser tout à plat Loredano et\nnommer son ennemi. Mais quand il fat question\nd'aller au Grand-Conseil, Loredano dit : « Messieurs,\n((je viens d'avoir du dessous dans l'endroit où\n(( j'avais le plus beau jeu, à plus forte raison l'au-\n\n===== Page 25 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 187\n« rai-je ici. Je demande donc, au cas que je sois\n(( refusé, d'être nommé à la seconde place, qui est\n(( celle de provéditeur de Dalmatie. » Alors tous\nceux qui prétendaient à cette place ouvrirent les\noreilles, bien résolus de faire agir leur faction pour\nse délivrer d'un concurrent si redoutable, en le fai-\nsant nommer à la première. De cette sorte, Loredano\nse rendit aussi puissant que son concurrent. Pour\nemporter la balance, il s'avança une seconde fois,\ndemandant, en cas de refus de l'une et l'autre place,\nl'ambassade de Constantinople, ce qui produisit le\nmême effet pour ceux qui y prétendaient. Moyennant\nquoi il fut nommé, au Grand-Conseil, provéditeur\ngénéral, et le pauvre Aimo, qui ne pouvait plus\nbriguer les places inférieures qu'il avait déjà possé-\ndées, est demeuré à ronger ses doigts à Padoue.\nAn surplus, notez que la charge ne pouvait tomber\nqu'en très-bonnes mains, et que ces gens-ci sont\ntrop sages pour faire rouler ces sortes de jeux sur\nd'autres que sur de très-bons sujets. J'ai eu le\nplaisir d'avoir mon cœur clair de leur façon de bal-\nlotter les charges.\nOn nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand-\nConseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères ;\ncharge assez importante. Le Grand-Conseil se tient\ndans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond\nest une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et\ndes inquisiteurs d'État , avec le trône du doge au\nmilieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de\nla salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns\n\n===== Page 26 =====\n\n188 Xy.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\naux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle.\nTous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se pla-\ncèrent. Les robes rouges avaient leurs places mar-\nquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents\nlieux de la salle , pour empêcher qu'il ne se fit du\nbruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée ; chose , à\nmon gré , où ils ne réussirent nullement , puisque\nTon y faisait un sabbat de l'autre monde ; aussi ne\nfaisait-on là que peloter en attendant partie. Près du\ngrand chancelier , sur l'estrade , il y avait une urne\ncontenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avait de\npersonnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de\ndorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent\ncelles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en\nquestion, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par\nleurs places , étaient électeurs de droit. Cela fait ,\nnous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin , ornée de la\nmême manière que la première, moins grande, rem-\nplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse.\nLes autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre , sa-\nluant jusqu'à terre les précédents avec une gravité\nsans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé , le chan-\ncelier parut précédé du corps des secrétaires , gens\nsubalternes , et précédant lui-même le vice-doge ;\ncar le doge était malade , et c'est le plus vieux des\nconseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas\nsur le trône et n*a pas le corno ; il Timitait tant qu'il\npouvait , ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet\nde taffetas noir , dont il ramenait le sommet par-\ndevant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable\n\n===== Page 27 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 189\nAnténor. Il était suivi de tous les conseillers en robes\nrouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva ; il\nla salua profondément sans ôter sa barrette que pour\nla Qua?'antie crimineWe, lorsqu'il passa devant elle.\nSeul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avait surla téte. Il\nmonta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et\nautres se placèrent autour de lui , et sur les ailes le\nchancelier à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le\nchef. Cette assemblée avait l'air tout à fait majes-\ntueux. Alors le chancelier se leva et dit que les sei-\ngneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini deman-\ndaient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs\nparents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédia-\ntement après, les trois i4î;t'o6/on prirent chacun un\npetit Évangile , et parcoururent les rangs en faisant\ntoucher à chacun cet Evangile du bout du doigt ,\nmarque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne\nfoi et sans brigue. Tous ces préalables finis , un\ngrand marsouin d'huissier , ayant mis une paire de\nlunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'était davan-\ntage, proclama d'un ton nasillard Veccellentissimo\nsignore Luca Priuli. A l'instant une vingtaine de\npetits enfants rouges comme ceux de l'hôpital se dis-\npersèrent par la salle , criant comme des perdus :\nPriuli ! Priuli ! Ils avaient chacun à la main une\nboite à deux compartiments , l'un blanc pour nom-\nmer, l'autre vert pour refuser ; l'ouverture commune\nétant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne\npuissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on\nmet la main , et à leur ceinture une gibecière pleine\nI. 11.\n\n===== Page 28 =====\n\n190 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nde petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemi-\nsette ; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci\nla mirent dans celle des enchàtres qu'ils voulurent.\nLes enfants portèrent leurs boites au chancelier, qui\nversa les ballottes des enchàtres blanches dans un\nbassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les\ntrois autres concurrents ; puis on compta les suf-\nfrages. Donato fut élu et nous sortîmes. Tout cela\nfut fait avec une rapidité surprenante , et en moins\nde temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris ; mais\nc'était une vraie comédie que de voir en sortant les\nprosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice\nqu'on lui donnait. D'honneur, ils sonnaient à se faire\nentendre au milieu de la place.\nJ'ai aussi vu ce que l'on appelle une fonction,\nc'est-à-dire une cérémonie où tous les grands magis-\ntrats vont en corps à une fête d'église. Je ne vous\nen parlerai guère, car cela ne vaut pas mieux que la\nprocession de la sainte hostie ; le cortège des ambassa-\ndeurs en est le principal ornement. Ils y assistent à\ncôté du doge avec leur maison ; mais ce qu'il y a de\nmieux, c'est la marche.\nUne procession en gondoles est à mon gré un\nmorceau divin , d'autant mieux que ce ne sont point\nalors des gondoles ordinaires , mais celles de la ré-\npublique, superbement sculptées et dorées , accom-\npagnées de celles des ambassadeurs, plus riches et\nplus galantes encore, surtout celle du nôtre. Ils sont\nles seuls dans l'Etat à qui il soit permis d'en avoir\nqui ne soient pas noires. Les gondoliers de la répu-\n\n===== Page 29 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 191\nblique sont tous en chapes de velours rouge , cha-\nmarrées d'or, avec de grands bonnets à l'albanaise.\nIls sont trop fiers de cet équipage pour se donner la\npeine de ramer. Aussi se font-ils remorquer bien et\nbeau par des petits bateaux remplis d'instruments de\nmusique.\nC'est assez parler de choses publiques; j'aurais\nbien de la peine à en dire autant des maisons parti-\nculières. Ici les étrangers n'ont pas trop beau jeu là- dessus. Messieurs les nobles viennent le soir au café\noù ils causent de fort bonne amitié avec nous; mais,\npour nous introduire dans leurs maisons, c'est une\nautre affaire. Avec cela il y a ici fort peu de maisons\noù l'on tienne assemblée, et ces assemblées ne sont\nni nombreuses ni amusantes pour des étrangers. On\nn'y a pas même la ressource du jeu; car il faudrait\nêtre pis que sorcier pour connaître leurs cartes, qui\nn'ont ni le nom ni la figure des nôtres. Les Véni-\ntiens, avec tout leur faste et leurs palais, ne savent\nce que c'est que de donner un poulet à personne, j'ai\nété quelquefois à la conversation chez la procura-\ntesse Foscarini , maison d'une richesse immense, et\nfemme très-gracieuse d'ailleurs; pour tout régal,\nsur les trois heures c'est-à-dire à onze heures du\nsoir de France vingt valets apportent dans un plat\nd'argent démesuré une grosse citrouille coupée en\nquartiers, que l'on qualifie du nom de melon d'eau,\nmets détestable s'il en fut jamais. Une pile d'as-\nsiettes d'argent l'accompagnent ; chacun se jette sur\nun quartier, prend par-dessus une petite tasse de\n\n===== Page 30 =====\n\n192 XV.— A M.

Je vous dirai franche-\nment qu'un des grands désagréments du voyage est\nde n'avoir pas, quand le soir vient, ses bonnes Pous-\nselines, son gros Blancey, son bon Quintin , ses amis\nMaleteste et Bévy, sa dame Courtois, ces excellentes\npetites dames de Montot et Bourbonne ; enfin tout\nnotre petit cercle, pour tenir, les coudes sur la table,\ndes propos de cent piques au-dessus de la place\nSaint-Marc et du Broglio, Il faut s'attendre, en pays\nétranger, à avoir les yeux satisfaits et le cœur en-\nnuyé ; de l'amusement de curiosité tant qu'il vous\nplaira, mais des ressources de société, aucune. Vous\nne vivez qu'avec des gens pour qui vous êtes sans\nintérêt, comme ils le sont pour vous. Et, quelque\naimables qu'ils fussent d'ailleurs, le moyen d'en\nprendre réciproquement la peine, quand on songe\nque l'on doit se quitter sous peu de jours, pour ne se\nrevoir jamais.\nIci notre principale ressource a été dans notre\nambassadeur, de qui nous recevons toutes sortes de\nbons traitements. C'est le comte de Froulay, qui\nrépare fort bien ici l'honneur de la nation, qui avait\nété un peu maléficié par son prédécesseur. Il nous a\nmenés plusieurs fois à sa maison de campagne en\nterre ferme, qui est vraiment fort belle, et nous a\ndonné l'accointance de tous les ambassadeurs ;\nmoyennant quoi notre porte est fort honorée des\nvisites de leurs excellences, et notre appétit fort satis-\nfait des festins dont ils nous régalent, surtout l'am-\n\n===== Page 31 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 193\nbassadeur de Naples, qui est un ribaud des plus\nfrancs que l'on puisse voir, fort honnête prêtre d'ail-\nleurs, homme de bonne compagnie et sans façon. Le\nmétier d'ambassadeur est assez triste ici ; ils n'ont de\nressource que celle de vivre ensemble, et ne peuvent\nabsolument voir aucun noble, auxquels il est dé-\nfendu, sous peine de mort, d'entrer chez eux. Ceci\nn'est point comminatoire, et l'on a vu un noble exé-\ncuté à mort, seulement pour avoir traversé la mai-\nson d'un ambassadeur, sans parler à personne, pour\naller voir en secret sa maltresse. Du reste, les am-\nbassadeurs ont de très-grands droits, entre autres,\nun fort particulier, d'avoir autour de leurs maisons\nun quartier de franchise très-étendu, où l'on ne peut\narrêter personne sans leur permission, et où ils exer-\ncent souverainement la police et la justice. Nous\navons vu aussi le vieux bonhomme maréchal Schu-\nlembourg, général des troupes de la république ;\nvous savez qu'elle a presque toujours des étrangers\npour cette place, qui ne vaut pas moins de cent mille\nécus de rente. C'est un bien honnête vieillard, qui\nentend la guerre à merveille et fort mal la morale.\nIl nous fait sur le chapitre des filles de fréquents ser-\nmons, peu écoutés et point du tout suivis; mais il\nfait plus de fruit à table, en nous faisant grande\nchère à l'allemande.

Par exemple, vous connaissez de répu-\ntion le palais de Saint-Marc; c'est un vilan monsieur,\ns'il en fut jamais, massif, sombre et gothique, du\nplus méchant goût. La grande cour en dedans ne\nlaisse pas cependant, surtout d'un côté, d'avoir quel-\nque chose de magnifique dans sa construction ; elle\nest assez singulièrement ornée par deux puits, dont\nles margelles prodigieuses, d'un seul jet de bronze,\n\n===== Page 33 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISK. 195\nsont d'un travail aussi fini que considérable, et par\nun superbe escalier tout de marbre blanc et violet,\nqu'on a nommé par anticipation , sachant que j'y\ndevais passer, V escalier des Géants, Il conduit à un\nautre, fort orné de statues et de dorures, qui conduit\nlui-même aux salles où se tiennent les différents con-\nseils. Ces appartements, selon l'ordinaire des vieux\npalais, sont mal distribués, mal tenus et assez som-\nbres; mais si fort enrichis de peintures des plus\ngrands maîtres, qu'il n'a pas fallu moins de huit\njours entiers à notre badauderie pour en voir le\nbout. Le doge est logé dans ce palais; c'est de tous\nles prisonniers de l'État le plus mal glté à mon gré ;\ncar les prisons ordinaires, qui sont près du palais,\nsont un bâtiment tout à fait élégant et agréable. Je\nne veux cependant pas y séjourner trop longtemps,\net je vais au plus vite à Téglise de Saint- Marc.\nVous vous êtes figuré que c'était un lieu admira-\nble ; mais vous vous trompez bien fort ; c'est une\néglise à la grecque, basse, impénétrable à la lumière,\nd'un goût misérable, tant en dedans qu'en dehors,\ncouverte de sept dômes revêtus en dedans de mosaï-\nques à fond d'or, qui les font ressembler bien mieux\nà des chaudières qu'à des coupoles. Elle a double\ncollatérale, dont les deux extérieures ne servent\nguère que de passage ou de promenoirs, et un long\nvestibule destiné au même usage. Avec les richesses\nimmenses qu'on y a prodiguées, il a bien fallu qu'à\n1 Charles de Brosses était d'une très-petite taille. R. G.\n\n===== Page 34 =====\n\n196 XVI.— A M. DE QTTINTIN.\nla fin elle fût curieuse, en dépit des ouvriers diabo-\nliques qui les ont mises en œuvre. Du haut en bas,\nen dedans et en dehors, Tégiise est couverte de pein-\ntures en mosaïque à fond d'or. Vous savez que la\nmosaïque est une peinture qui se fait avec des petites\npièces d'environ trois lignes en carré de pierres na-\nturelles, ou de verre mis en couleur, qui servent à\nnuer et à dessiner le sujet. Ces ouvrages ne peuvent\njamais être bien délicats mais aussi le coloris n'est\npas sujet à se perdre, ce qui a engagé les premiers\npeintres à s'en servir souvent. Maintenant la patience\ninouïe qu'il faut pour cela et le peu de beauté dont\nces ouvrages sont susceptibles en ont fait depuis né-\ngliger la méthode. Celles-ci doivent être regardées\ncomme le premier monument de la peinture, puis-\nqu'elles ont été faites dès l'an 1071, par des ouvriers\ngrecs qu'on fît venir exprès. Ainsi, n'en déplaise aux\nFlorentins, ce n'est point chez eux, c'est ici que cet\nart s'est renouvelé. Leur Cimabue, plus de cent cin-\nquante ans après, vint en prendre l'idée sur les ou-\nvrages de Saint-Marc. C'est en vérité la seule obli-\ngation qu'on ait, tant à lui qu'à ces gens-ci, que\nd'avoir eu le goût assez pervers pour faire les\nméchantes choses qui depuis ont donné lieu à en\nfaire de si belles. Au coloris près, qui s'est assez\nconservé par le genre de l'ouvrage, on ne peut rien\nvoir de si pitoyable que ces mosaïques ; heureuse-\nment les ouvriers ont eu la sage précaution d'écrire\nsur chaque sujet ce qu'ils ont voulu représenter\n1 Dans une mosaïque placée sous le portique, on voit Adam et\n\n===== Page 35 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 197\nLes autres morceaux du méjue genre, que Ton a faits\ndepuis sont mieux exécutés ; il y en a beaucoup qui\nse distinguent par la brillante vivacité du coloris et\ndes fonds d'or; mais en général il n'y a rien là de\nfort satisfaisant, si ce n'est le plafond de la sacristie\noù l'on a eu le bon esprit de représenter, non des\nfigures, mais des broderies et des arabesques de la\ndernière beauté ; c'est le seul genre où la mosaïque\nsoit propre. Le pavé est aussi en entier de mosaïque,\ncomposé de plusieurs mille millions de ces petites\npièces de marbre, jaspes, lapis, agates, serpentine,\ncuivre, etc., sur lequel on ne peut faire un pas sans\nglisser. Le tout a été si bien joint que, quoique le\npavé se soit enfoncé dans certains endroits et fort\nrelevé dans d'autres, aucune petite pièce ne s'est\ndémentie ni n'a sauté; bref, c'est sans contredit le\npremier endroit du monde pour jouer à la toupie.\nBelle comparaison et tout à fait noble ! Une personne\nde goût, telle que vous êtes, ne peut manquer d'en être contente.\nJe ne vous parlerai ni des reliques que Misson a\ntraitées à fond, ni du trésor. Ce n'est pas que je ne\npusse, si je voulais vous en faire une docte et ample\ndescription; mais dans le vrai, je ne l'ai pas vu.

C'est en ce siècle- là, ou environ, que fut écrit le fameux livre de TEvangile\nde Saint-Marc, qu'on garde encore aujourd'hui dans le trésor de\nVenise. Je l'ai vu et examiné autant qu'on peut examiner un ma- nuscrit qui est déjà presque tout effacé, et si pourri que les feuilles\nétant toutes collées l'une contre l'autre, on ne péut tenter de tour-\nner un feuillet sans que tout s'en aille en pièces. Ces feuilles de\npapier d'Égypte me semblèrent beaucoup plus délicates que toutes\nles autres que j'ai vues en différents endroits. Sur la forme des\nlettres, il me parut que c'est le plus ancien manuscrit qu'on ait\nencore vu, et qu'on ne se hasarde guère en disant qu'il est pour\nle plus tard du iv siècle. Il y a cent-quarante-six ans qu'on l'a mis dans un caveau souterrain dont la voûte même est plus basse dans\nles marées que la mer voisine. De là vient que l'eau dégoutte per-\npétuellement sur ceux que la curiosité y amène. Cette grande hu-\nmidité a mis le manuscrit en un état qu'on n'y saurait lire deux\nmots de suite.

Le vaisseau en est fort\nbeau et bien orné de peintures ; mais la quantité des\nlivres est au-dessous de ce qu'en ont en France cer-\ntains particuliers. Le cabinet ou salon des manu-\nscrits est plus à remarquer ; la quantité en est fort\nconsidérable; presque tous viennent du cardinal\nBessarion. Ils sont fort bien tenus, d'une bonne con-\nservation et entre les mains d'un bibliothécaire de la\npremière distinction ; c'est le procurateur Tiepolo.\nIl a sous lui Zanetti \\ jeune homme qui ne parait\npas manquer d'érudition , et fort communicatif.\nAinsi;, c'est à tort que le P. Montfaucon s'exhale par-\ntout en plaintes contre le peu d'accès qu'on trouve\ndans les bibliothèques d'Italie ; il devrait plutôt dire\nque les gens de ce pays-ci se défient tellement des\nmoines, qu'ils ne veulent rien montrer aux gens de\ncette robe, quelque mérite qu'ils aient d'ailleurs.\nZanetti fait imprimer maintenant le catalogue et la\nnotice de tous les manuscrits de Saint-Marc. Il me\nmontra un livre qui passe pour le premier imprimé\nen France. Il est intitulé : Guillelmi Ficheti alnetani\n Zanetli (Antoine-Marie), bibliothécaire de Saint-Marc, auteur\nd'un fort bon livre sur les peintures de l'école de Venise.

Au commencement du livre, contre\nl'usage ordinaire de ce temps-là, et non à la fin,\nest écrit : jEdibus Sorhonœ Parisii scriptum impres-\nsumque anno uno et septuagesimo supra mille-\nsimum.\nLe vestibule de cette bibliothèque est digne de la\nplus grande curiosité, par les statues antiques qu'on\ny a rassemblées : un Ganymède de marbre, accroché\nje ne sais par où (car Taigle qui est dessus ne le tient\npresque point), est suspendu au plafond. Mais tout\ncède à la beauté inimitable de la Léda et de son\ncygne. C'est une fille qui aime l'ordre et l'arrange-\nment; à cet effet, elle a la main passée, je ne sais\ncomme, pour mettre chaque chose à sa place.

Ce sont de jeunes tilles qui travaillent\nà cet ouvrage ; il est enrichi de plusieurs pierres\ngravées tirées du fameux cabinet de ïiepolo, qu'il\nfaut que vous voyiez quand vous serez ici, et de\ncelui d'Antonio Zanetti, célèbre brocanteur. N'ou-\nbliez pas non plus de voir en passant le cabinet de\nlivres recherchés de l'Anglais Smith, où il a rassem-\nblé une rare collection d'éditions de 1400.\nNe vous figurez pas que les canaux qui forment\nici les seules rues praticables aient des quais ; pres-\nque tous n'en ont point : la mer bat jusque sur le\nseuil des portes de chaque maison. Dès qu'on en sort,\non a le pied dedans. Cela n'en est peut-être pas\nmieux ; mais cela est plus singulier , et n'est pas plus\nembarrassant pour sortir. Ceux qui n'ont point de\ngondoles à eux trouvent à chaque instant des fiacres\naquatiques dans les carrefours, et comme cette ville\nest toute d'Ilots et de pilotis, chaque maison a aussi\nson issue sur la terre. Les rues sans nombre , sont\nétroites à ne pouvoir passer deux de front sans se\ncoudoyer, toutes pavées de pierres plates ce qui les\nrend glissantes à l'excès à la moindre pluie : elles se\ncommuniquent par cinq cents ponts ou plus.

Les canaux, malgré\nleurs agréments, ont une chose intolérable. Le flux\net reflux sont ici comme dans l'Océan , et quand la\nmer est basse en été , les canaux étroits sont d'une\nhorrible infection. On sait bien qu'il faut que les\nchoses sentent ce qu'elle doivent sentir. Il est permis\naux canaux quels qu'ils soient , de puotter en été ;\nmais pour le coup, c'est abuser de la permission.\nLa ville, en général, n'est pas fort bien bâtie ; ce-\npendant elle a un air de distinction. Plusieurs belles\narchitectures d'églises, comme Saint-Pierre, San-\nGiorgio , San-Francesco , la Sainte , le Redentore ,\nSafi-Salvatore , etc. ; presque toutes du Palladio ou\ndu Sansovino ; sans parler de nombre de palais ma-\ngnifiques sur le Grand Canal, dont les meilleurs sont\nles palais Grimani, Pesaro, Cornaro etLabia; mais\ncomme je vous ai donné parole de ne point parler de\ntableaux, l'architecture ira de compagnie, et je n'en\ndirai plus mot. C'est pourtant ici que sont les chefs-\nd'œuvre sans nombre qu'a produits en peinture l'é-\ncole vénitienne. On a imprimé une notice des ta-\nbleaux publicSj dans laquelle une grande quantité de\nbelles choses se trouvent noyées dans une quantité\ninfiniment plus grande de nlédidcres où de mau-\nvaises. Il me faudrait huit jours de narration pour\nfaire le triage en détail ; voilà ce qui sauve mes au-\nditeurs. Quant à vous, ainsi que je l'ai annoncé, vous\nn'y perdrez rien ; mais ne serait-on pas fâché de ne\nm'entendre rien dire de la Rosalba, cette fameuse\n\n===== Page 41 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VÉNISÈ. 203\npeintre de portraits au pastel, qui a tout surpassé en\nce genre ? J'étais tenté de lui faire faire le mien , si\nje n'avais pensé que ma figure ne valait pas trente\nsequins. En récompense , j'eus la folie de lui offrir\nvingt - cinq louis d'or d'une Madeleine grande\ncomme la main, qu'elle a copiée d'après le Corrége.\nC'était le prix qu'elle l'estimait; et, par bonheur\npour mes vingt-cinq louis , elle ne veut pas s'en dé-\nfaire. Ajoutez encore la remarque suivante à l'article\ndes bâtiments. Dans une très-belle église que l'on\nconstruit actuellement, parmi les jaspes de Sicile\ndont elle est revêtue , on y a mêlé des papiers mar-\nbrés et vernis couverts de talcs, qui font un aussi bon\neffet que le jaspe ; reste à savoir si cela durera long-\ntemps.\nLes palais sont ici d'une magnificence prodiguée\nsans beaucoup de goût. Il n'y a pas moins de deux\ncents pièces d'appartements tout chargés de ri-\nchesses , dans le seul palais Foscarini ; mais tout se\nsurmarche ; il n'y a pas un seul cabinet ni un fau-\nteuil où Von puisse s'asseoir, à cause de la délicatesse\ndes sculptures* Lé palais Labia construit à la mo-\nderne, est le seul qui m'ait paru bien entendu en de-\ndans.

Il est si célèbre, que je fus\nd'abord assez mécontent de trouver les salles des\narmes mal rangées, pleines de vieilleries et de\nrouille , et assez inférieures à d'autres que j'ai vues.\nIl faut néanmoins convenir qu'il est très-remarquable\npar sa vaste étendue et par la quantité de choses\nqu'il contient. Voici les principales qui me soient\nrestées dans l'esprit : des parcs de canôns de fonte et\nde fer, dont quelques-uns sont monstrueux, en\nnombre si étonnant qu'il surpasse celui des fusils et\ndes pistolets ; les tours où on les tourne pour les\nrendre unis en dedans ; la pièce qui fut fondue de-\nvant Henri III, chargée d'ornements et de sculptures\nexcellentes. Un recueil d'ancres de prodigieuses\ngrosseurs; un autre de mâts à l'équivalent.... Des\nsalles et des fabriques de toute espèce.... Trois gros\nrobinets de fontaine qui donnent du vin les ou-\nvriers en vont prendre là tant qu'ils veulent ; ils sont\nau nombre de trois mille , et s'amusent presque tout\nle jour sans travailler ; mais aussi quand il le faut,\nils font merveille jour et nuit ; ils voient quand l'af-\nfaire est pressante , parce qu'alors on double leur\npaye. Une salle des câbles , d'une architecture en\n\n===== Page 43 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 205\nbois, très-belle ; les fabriques couvertes où Ton con-\nstruit les vaisseaux , et les grands canaux où on les\njette. Il y a actuellement dix-huit gros bâtiments sur\nces chantiers ; les péottes et gondoles dorées de la\nrépublique ; et enfin le Bucentaure. Celui - ci est à\nmon gré une des belles et des curieuses choses de\nl'univers. C'est une grosse galéasse , ou fort grande\ngalère, toute sculptée et dorée à fond en dehors, du\nmeilleur goût et de la manière la plus finie. Le de-\ndans forme une vastissime salle parquetée, garnie de\nsofas tout autour et d'un trône au bout, pour le doge.\nElle est partagée dans sa longueur par une ligne de\nstatues dorées qui soutiennent le plafond ou pont\nsculpté et doré en plein. Les embrasures des fe-\nnêtres , l'éperon des balcons de la poupe, les bancs\ndes rameurs et le gouvernail sont du même goût, et\ntoute la machine a pour toit une tente de velours,\ncouleur de feu, brodée d'or.\nLe petit arsenal du palais Saint-Marc est plus\nagréable et mieux rangé que le grand ; il commu-\nnique à la salle du Grand Conseil , et les armes sont\ntoujours chargées, pour être toutes prêtes à la dé-\nfense en cas d'émeute populaire ; car avouez que,\nlorsque le corps des nobles est assemblé, une conju-\nration ou une sédition aurait beau jeu pour s'en dé-\nfaire d'un coup de filet ; aussi y a-t-il toujours alors\nà la tour Saint-Marc des procurateurs qui, sous d'au-\ntres prétextes, ont l'œil alerte, tandis que l'assem-\nblée se tient. Il est fort rempli de choses curieuses,\ndont il me semble que les relations imprimées par-\nI. 12\n\n===== Page 44 =====\n\n206 XVI.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nlent avec assez d'exactitude. On y conserve quantité\nd'armures de grands capitaines ; celle de Henri IV,\ndont il fit présent à la république, est comme de rai-\nson dans le lieu le plus honorable. J'ai remarqué un\ncoup de fusil dans cette armure. C'est aussi là qu'est\nun cadenas célèbre, dont jadis un certain tyran de\nPadoue, inventeur de cette machine odieuse, se ser-\nvait pour mettre en sûreté l'honneur de sa femme. Il\nfallait que cette femme eût 'bien de l'honneur, car la\nserrure est diablement large.\nL'inquisition existe à Venise ; mais elle a les on-\ngles tellement rognés, que c'est à peu près comme\nsil n'y en avait point. Les ministres de ce tribunal\nne peuvent rien conclure qu'en présence de trois\npersonnes du gouvernement, préposées à cet effet.\nDès qu'on avance une proposition tant soit peu forte,\nune des trois se lève et sort ; dès lors l'assemblée ne\npeut plus rien faire. Les gens d'Eglise n'ont pas beau\njeu ici pour cabaler : dès qu'un homme a quelque\nbénéfice, quelque brevet de Rome ou simplement\nle petit collet, il est exclu ipso facto de toute part au\ngouvernement, et sensé démis de sa charge s'il en a\nune. Toute personne qui a ou qui a eu charge de mi-\nnistre de la république à Rome ne peut jamais être\nfait cardinal ni obtenir aucune prélature. Sage poli-\ntique, qui a même son avantage pour les ecclésias-\ntiques, car les gens qui aiment le repos ou qui ne\nveulent pas être ballottés n'ont qu'à se faire abbés.\n\n===== Page 45 =====\n\nXVII.— A M.

Le coloris du Giorgione\nest d'une entente et d'une lierté étonnantes ; mais il\ny a quelque chose de brusque et de sauvage. Je le\ncomparerais volontiers, pour le coloris, à ce qu'est\nMichel- Ange pour le dessin. Avant lui, on dessinait\ndes figures gothiques que Ton coloriait avec soin et\navec éclat, d'une manière sèche et sans fin. Ces deux\nmaîtres sont les czars Pierre de la peinture, qui en\nont banni la barbarie ; mais ce n'a pas été sans féro-\ncité. Au dedans, quantité d'assez bonnes peintures,\nsurtout les Bains de Diane et le Jugement de Paris.\nA Saint-Roch, la Piscine probatique, merveilleux\nouvrage du Tintoret. C'est là qu'il a montré qu'il\nsavait parfaitement, lorsqu'il voulait s'en donner la\npeine, ordonner sans furie, dessiner sans rudesse et\n\n===== Page 46 =====\n\n208 XVir.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\ncolorier sans noirceur. Je serais fort enclin à juger\nque le Tintoret est le premier de tous les peintres\nvénitiens, lorsqu'il veut bien faire, ce qui lui arrive\ntrès-rarement. — Saint-Martin faisant l'aumône,\nbonne fresque du Pordenone.\nLe Tintoret a peint à l'école Saint-Roch une partie\nde la vie de Jésus-Christ, dans une quantité de grands\ntableaux. La vie d'un autre peintre n'aurait pas suffi\nà faire tout ce qu'il a exécuté ici, et presque toujours\nfort bien. C'est là que tout peintre trouvera une école\ninépuisable de dessins et de clairs-obscurs : l'An-\nnonciation, la Fuite en Egypte, la Cène, et surtout\nla figure de Jésus-Christ, vêtu de blanc devant Pi-\nlate, et le grand tableau du Crucifiement, chef-\nd'œuvre du Tintoret, dont Augustin Carrache a\ngravé une si belle estampe, m'ont paru admirables.\nQuel dommage que ce peintre, avec tant de talent,\nn'ait point du tout connu les grâces qui peuvent seu-\nles leur donner du prix !\nUne chapelle est remplie de belles choses, mal\nplacées dans ce lieu obscur, où on les voit à peine.\nIl faut considérer le mieux que l'on pourra le ta-\nbleau du Baptême de Jésus-Christ, et le beau pla-\nfond représentant l'Adoration des Mages ; la Recon-\nnaissance de saint Nicolas, les Stigmates de saint\nFrançois, et les quatre Évangélistes, par le Véronèse ;\nla Vierge avec saint André, et la Prédication de\nsaint Jean-Baptiste, par le Fiammingo, et surtout\n1 Denis Calvart. R. C.\n\n===== Page 47 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLEAUX DE VENISE. 209\nla Vierge avec saint Sébastien, saint Nicolas, etc.,\npar le Titien. Cet excellent tableau est fort noirci\npar le peu de soin qu'on en a eu, et par la mauvaise\ndisposition du lieu. La figure de saint Sébastien est\ntrès-délicate, très-agréable, mais peut-être aussi\ntrop ronde et trop efféminée.\nOn pourrait appeler Saint-Sébastien l'école de\nPaul Véronèse. On y voit la gradation de son génie,\nde ses divers ouvrages et de toutes ses manières. Le\nplafond de la sacristie, représentant le Couronne-\nment de la Vierge , par où il a commencé , est fort\ninférieur à ce qu'il a fait depuis. Les plus belles\npeintures qu'il ait faites ici sont le plafond de l'église,\nreprésentant l'histoire d'Esther ; les portes de l'orgue\nreprésentant au dehors la Purification et la Guérison\ndu Paralytique ; le tableau représentant saint Sébas-\ntien devant le tyran, celui de saint Sébastien Hé à\nun tronc d'arbre; le grand Festin de Jésus-Christ\nchez Simon le lépreux , peint dans le réfectoire ; et\nsurtout le Martyre de saint Marc et de saint Marcel-\nlian, ouvrage très-bien composé, où tout se rapporte\nau sujet; chose rare dans les ordonnances de Paul,\nqui n'a pas mieux connu l'unité d'action que le cos-\ntume. Quant aux quatre grands Festins de cet auteur,\nle premier de tous, sans contredit, est celui des\nNoces de Cana, peint dans le réfectoire de Saint-\nGeorges ; puis celui chez le pharisien , qui était ci-\ndevant aux Servîtes, et qui est à présent à Versailles\ndans le grand salon d'Hercule ; puis celui chez le\nlévite, peint à l'éghse des Saints-Jean-et-Paul ; mais\n\n===== Page 48 =====\n\n210 XVII.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nces deux peuvent aller en concurrence, et enfin celui\nque l'on voit ici à Saint-Sébastien, qui est le moindre\ndes quatre. Paul s'est beaucoup copié lui-même dans\ntous ses ouvrages, mais surtout dans ses quatre\nFestins.\nA l'école de la Charité, la Vierge Marie montant\nles degrés du temple, par le Titien, tableau de la\npremière classe; avec le saint Pierre, martyr, ils\npassent pour les deux plus beaux du Titien : celui-ci\nest fort distingué pour ses airs de tête et son admi-\nrable coloris. Il m'a fait plus de plaisir que le Saint-\nPierre, martyr; et le Saint-Laurent des Jésuites m'en\na plus fait que l'un et l'autre. Cependant celui-ci ,\nqui est de la seconde manière du Titien , l'emporte\nde beaucoup par le coloris sur le Saint-Laurent, qui\nn'est que de sa troisième manière ; alors son coloris\nest devenu trop vague et négligé.\nEnfin à San-Giorgio, dans le fond du réfectoire,\nles Noces de Cana de Paul Véronèse, tableau non-\nseulement de la première classe, mais des premiers\nde cette classe. On peut le mettre en comparaison\navec la Bataille de Constantin contre le tyran\nMaxence , peinte au Yatican , par Raphaël et par\nJules Romain, soit pour la grandeur de la composi-\ntion , soit pour le nombre infini des figures, soit pour\nl'extrême beauté de l'exécution. Il y a bien plus de\nfeu , plus de dessin , plus de science, plus de fidélité\nde costume dans la bataille de Constantin ; mais dans\ncelui-ci , quelle richesse ! quel coloris ! quelle har-\nmonie dans les couleurs! quelle vérité dans les\n\n===== Page 49 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLËAUX DE VENISE. 211\nétoffes ! quelle ordonnance et quelle machine éton-\nnante dans toute la composition ! L'un de ces ta-\nbleaux est une action vive, et l'autre est un spectacle.\nIl semble dans celui-ci qu'on aille passer tout au\ntravers des portiques, et que la foule des ns qui y\nsont assemblés vous fassent compagnie. L'architec-\nture, qui est une des belles parties du tableau, a été\nfaite par Benedetto Caliari , frère de Paul : il excel-\nlait dans ce genre. Paul a représenté au naturel les\nplus fameux peintres vénitiens exécutant un concert.\nAu-devant du tableau, dans le vide de l'intérieur du\ntriclinium, le Titien joue de la basse ; Paul joue de\nla viole; le Tintoret du violon, et le Bassan de la\nflûte, par où il a voulu faire allusion à la profonde\nscience et à l'exécution lente et sage du Titien , aux\nbrillants et aux agréments de Paul , à la rapidité du\nTintoret, et à la suavité du Bassan. Remarquez l'at-\ntention que donne Paul à un homme qui vient lui\nparler, et la suspension de son archet. Une grande\nfigure debout tenant une coupe à la main, vêtue\nd'une étoffe à l'orientale blanche et verte, est celle\nde Benedetto, son frère.\nCe n'est pas sans plaisir que j'ai trouvé, à Casa\nPisani, l'admirable Famille de Darius de ce même\nPaul Véronèse, tableau dont j'ai l'esquisse faite de\nsa main, pour l'exécution de son grand ouvrage. Il y\na deux ou trois tètes finies par le maître ; le reste en\npartie achevé par ses élèves, en partie resté en ébau-\nche. On y voit aussi Loth enivré par ses filles du\ncavalier Liberi. Ce peintre travaillait d'une assez\n\n===== Page 50 =====\n\n212 XVIII.— A M. DE BLAN€EY.\ngrande manière et avait beaucoup étudié Michel-\nAnge. Il réussit assez bien dans la composition\ndes tableaux d'histoire, et aimait entre autres à\npeindre des nudités et des sujets libres.

DE BLANCEY,\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n29 août.\nCe que j'avais prévu est arrivé, mon gros Blan-\ncey ; votre première lettre vient de m'ètre renvoyée\nde Rome; elle n'est pas de fraîche date, quoique\nfort moderne en comparaison d'une autre que je\nreçois de Londres , laquelle a été renvoyée de Rome\nà la grande poste de Paris, d'où elle est revenue à\nRome, puis ici. Elle vient d'arriver tout essoufflée\nd'une si longue traite. Il me semble, mon petit ami,\nque vous vous donnez assez joUment les violons ; la\nmodestie vous siérait cependant mieux qu'à per-\nsonne. C'est moi qui pourrais en manquer, tandis\nque je mets à Venise la nation française sur un si\ngrand pied que tout franc, je crains qu'un autre ne\npuisse s'y soutenir. Pour vous, on sait assez que vous\nn'êtes l'alné que secwidum quid. Cependant il y au- rait de la dureté à vouloir vous ôter la satisfaction\nde vous louer vous-même sur l'article, puisque vous\n\n===== Page 51 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 213\nne Têtes là -dessus par personne autre. Témoignez,\nje vous prie à ces dames, combien je suis sensible\nà l'empressement qu'elles veulent bien avoir pour\nmes nouvelles. Je me souviens tous les jours d'elles\net avec plaisir. Dans cette commémoration, ma\nbonne amie de Montot tient le premier rang. Ce\nserait bien en vain que l'on courrait le monde pour\ntrouver ailleurs un cœur aussi sensible et aussi vrai,\nune âme plus pure et meilleure, un caractère aussi\négal, aussi sociable, aussi doux; en vérité, je pense\nd'elle ce que l'on a dit d'un homme célèbre qiiil\nfaisait honneur à Ihumanité, Qu'a-t-elle besoin\nd'être d'une aussi jolie figure ? Elle devrait la laisser\nà quelque autre ; elle n'en a que faire pour être uni-\nversellement chérie de tout le monde. Je lui passe\ncependant ses yeux si doux et si fins, parce qu'ils\nsont le plus beau miroir de la plus belle âme qui ait\njamais été. Je suis vraiment affligé qu'elle ait perdu\nson dernier enfant; mais je m'en console, en pensant\nque c'est une perte que l'on peut réparer en deux\nminutes. Au surplus, assurez-les toutes bien fort\nque je persiste opiniâtrément dans la bonne religion,\net que je n'ai point encore, au milieu des infidèles,\nquitté les sentiments orthodoxes, mais je ne réponds\npas de ce que la peur du martyre peut me faire faire\nà Florence. Continuez-moi exactement votre chro-\nnique. S'il n'y a point d'histoire, parbleu ! vous\nvoilà bien en peine, faites-en; moi qui vous parle,\nme mets- je en peine de mentir pour vous amu-\nser?\n\n===== Page 52 =====\n\n214 XVIII.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nJe quitte Dijon, non sans regrets, pour revenir à\nVenise.\nJe voudrais bien pouvoir vous parler savamment\ndu carnaval. On nous presse fort ici d'y revenir pas-\nser ce temps, et l'on nous promet de nous faire voir\nune tout autre Venise ; mais je n'imagine pas que\nnous lui donnions la préférence sur nos affaires et sur\nnos amis. Ce carnaval commence dès le 5 octobre, et\nil y en a un autre petit de quinze jours à l'Ascension ;\nde sorte que l'on peut compter ici environ six mois,\noù qui que ce soit ne va autrement qu'en masque,\nprêtres ou autres, même le nonce et le gardien des\ncapucins. Ne pensez pas que je raille, c'est l'habit\nd'ordonnance ; et les curés seraient, dit-on, mécon-\nnus de leurs paroissiens, l'archevêque de son clergé,\ns'ils n'avaient le masque à la main ou sur le nez. Je\nregrette cette singularité, et encore plus les opéras\net les spectacles du temps. Ce n'est pas que je man-\nque de musique ; il n'y a presque point de soirée\nqu'il n'y ait académie quelque part ; le peuple court\nsur le Canal l'entendre avec autant d'ardeur que si\nc'était pour la première fois. L'affolement de la na-\ntion pour cet art est inconcevable. Vivaldi s'est fait\nde mes amis intimes, pour me vendre des concertos\nbien cher. Il y a en partie réussi, et moi, à ce que je\ndésirais, qui était de l'entendre et d'avoir souvent de\nbonnes récréations musicales : c'est un vecchio qui\na une furie de composition prodigieuse. Je l'ai ouï\nse faire fort de composer un concerto, avec toutes ses\nparties, plus promptement qu'un copiste ne le pourrait\n\n===== Page 53 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 215\ncopier. J'ai trouvé, à mon grand étonnement, qu'il\nn'est pas aussi estimé qu'il le mérite en ce pays-ci,\noù tout est de mode, où l'on entend ses ouvrages de-\npuis trop longtemps, et où la musique de l'année\nprécédente n'est plus de recette. Le fameux Saxon\nest aujourd'hui l'homme fété. Je l'ai ouï chez lui\naussi bien que la célèbre Faustina Bordoni, sa femme,\nqui chante d'un grand goût et d'une légèreté char-\nmante ; mais ce n'est plus une voix neuve. C'est sans\ncontredit la plus complaisante et la meilleure femme\ndu monde, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure chanteuse.\nLa musique transcendante ici est celle des hôpi-\ntaux. Il y en a quatre, tous composés de filles bâtar-\ndes ou orphelines, et de celles que leurs parents ne\nsont pas en état d'élever. Elles sont élevées aux dé-\npens de l'Etat, et on les exerce uniquement à exceller\ndans la musique. Aussi chantent-elles comme des\nanges, et jouent du violon, de la flûte, de l'orgue, du\nhautbois, du violoncelle, du basson ; bref, il n'y a\nsi gros instrument qui puisse leur faire peur. Elles\nsont cloîtrées en façon de religieuses. Ce sont elles\nseules qui exécutent, et chaque concert est composé\nd'une quarantaine de filles. Je vous jure qu'il n'y a\nrien de si plaisant que de voir une jeune et jolie re-\nligieuse, en habit blanc, avec un bouquet de grenades\nsur l'oreille, conduire l'orchestre et battre la mesure\navec toute la grâce et la précision imaginables. Leurs\nvoix sont adorables pour la tournure et la légèreté ;\n* Hasse (Jean-Adolphe) , un des plus célèbres compositeur\ndu xviu' siècle; mort à Venise en 1783. R.

La Zabetta des Incurables est surtout\nétonnante par l'étendue de sa voix et les coups d'ar-\nchet qu'elle a dans le gosier. Pour moi, je ne fais\naucun doute qu'elle n'ait avalé le violon de Somis.\nC'est elle qui enlève tous les suffrages, et ce serait\nvouloir se faire assommer par la populace que d'éga-\nler quelque autre à elle. Mais, écoutez, mes amis, je\ncrois que personne ne nous entend, et je vous dis à\nl'oreille que la Margarita des Mendicanti la vaut\nbien, et me plait davantage.\nCelui des quatre hôpitaux où je vais le plus sou-\nvent, et où je m'amuse le mieux, c'est l'hôpital de la\nPiété ; c'est aussi le premier pour la perfection des\nsymphonies. Quelle roideur d'exécution ! C'est là\nseulement qu'on entend ce premier coup d'archet, si\nfaussement vanté à l'Opéra de Paris. La Chiarretta\nserait sûrement le premier violon de l'Italie , si\nl'Anna-Maria des Hospitalettes ne la surpassait en-\ncore. J'ai été assez heureux pour entendre cette der-\nnière, qui est si fantasque qu'à peine joue-t-elle une\nfois en un an. Ils ont ici une espèce de musique que\nnous ne connaissons point en France , et qui me pa-\nrait plus propre que nulle autre pour le jardin de\nBourbonne. Ce sont de grands concertos où il n'y a\npoint de violino principale. Quintin peut demander\nà Bourbonne s'il veut que je lui en apporte une pro-\nvision.

Groi-\nriez-vous bien que l'espèce de fonction qui se fit en\ndernier lieu le jour de Saint-Barthélemi, et que l'on\nappelle le théâtre de la thériaque, est une chose tout\nà fait amusante ? Toutes les drogues qui entrent dans\ncette composition y sont non-sealement étalées en\nguise de dessert monté , mais encore arrangées avec\nautant d'adresse que de patience ; ce sont des ca-\nmaïeux, des broderies , des paysages et surtout des\nsuites de médailles d'empereurs romains admirables.\nLes vipères y forment des guirlandes et des festons,\net Ton a trouvé le secret de leur donner un air ga-\nlant. Le talent de la nation italienne pour les orne-\nments est exquis; avec une douzaine de nappes\nblanches et autant de mannequins, ils ont façonné en\nun instant autant de statues dignes de Phidias. On\npose cela sur une architecture des trois ordres , de\nmême fabrique ; en vingt-quatre heures , voilà une\néglise parée à ravir pour le jour de sa fête. Je n'ai\npas vu les combats des gondoliers sur les ponts , on\nles a abolis à mon grand regret. En récompense, ils\nont inventé un autre jeu appelé les forces d Hercule,\nUne certaine quantité d'hommes tout nus, se rangent\ndans le Canal en nombre égal, vis-à-vis les uns des\nautres, sur deux lignes ; de petites planches étroites\nportent des deux bouts sur les épaules; d'autres\nhommes montent debout sur ces planches ; un autre\nrang d'hommes sur ceux-ci par la même méthode, I. 13\n\n===== Page 56 =====\n\n218 XVIII.— A M.

Tout\ncela ne parvient pas à bien sans que les planches ne\ncassent souvent, et que la pyramide ou château de\ncartes ne soit dérangée par les fréquentes cascades\ndans Teau. Ce petit jeu, à se rompre le cou, se pra-\ntique quelquefois près du pont de Rialto. Je ne sais\npourquoi on s'extasie si fort en parlant de ce pont ;\non pourrait se contenter de dire qu'il est assez beau.\nIl est vrai qu'il n'y a qu'une arcade ; mais le lieu n'en\nexige pas davantage, et elle n'est pas plus large\nqu'une de celles du pont Saint-Esprit. Il est vrai\naussi qu'il est tout de marbre blanc et fort large ; car\nil y a dessus trois rues et quatre rangs de boutiques,\nà la vérité épaisses comme des lames de couteaux, et\nles rues à l'avenant. Tout cela ne fait pas un tiers en\nsus de la largeur du Pont-Neuf.\nJ'avais annoncé, ce me semble, que je ne dirais\nplus rien de Venise.

J'en suis moins surpris depuis que\nje sais que les religieuses en portent, et que j'ai\nappris qu'une abbesse, aujourd'hui vivante, s'était\njadis battue à coups de poignard contre une autre\ndame, pour l'abbé de Pomponne. L'aventure ne\nlaissa pas de faire quelque éclat, car elle ne s'était\npas passée dans le couvent,\nKAgatinaest la plus splendide de toutes les cour-\ntisanes de Venise.

L'ouvrier, en soufflant, en\nfait un globe creux; puis , à force de le balancer en\nl'air et de le présenter à tout moment à la bouche du\nfourneau , afin d'y entretenir un certain degré de\nfusion, toujours en le tournant fort vite, pour empê-\ncher que la matière présentée au feu ne coule plus\nd'un côté que d'un autre , il parvient à en faire un\nlong ovale. Alors un autre ouvrier, avec la pointe\nd'une paire de ciseaux, faits comme des forces à\ntondre les moutons, c'est-à-dire qui s'élargissent en\nrelâchant la main , perce l'ovale par son extrémité.\nLe premier ouvrier, qui tient la verge à laquelle est\nattaché ce globe , le tourne fort vite tandis que le\nsecond lâche peu à peu la main qui tient les ciseaux.\nDe cette manière l'ovale s'ouvre en entier par l'un\ndes bouts, comme un marli de verre.

It comes from Charles de Brosses's \"Lettres familières d'Italie\". Please bridge the gaps between the events that de Brosses describes in a plausible way.\nOn nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand Conseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères, charge assez importante. Le Grand Conseil se tient dans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond est une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et des inquisiteurs d'État, avec le trône du doge au milieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de la salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns aux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle. Tous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se placèrent. Les robes rouges avoient leurs places marquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents lieux de la salle, pour empêcher qu'il ne se fît du bruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée; chose, à mon gré, où ils ne réussirent nullement, puisque l'on y faisoit un sabbat de l'autre monde; aussi ne faisoit-on là que peloter en attendant partie.\n\nPrès du grand chancelier, sur l'estrade, il y avoit une urne contenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avoit de personnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de dorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent celles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en question, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par leurs places, étoient électeurs de droit.\n\nCela fait, nous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin, ornée de la même manière que la première, moins grande, remplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse. Les autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre, saluant jusqu'à terre les précédents, avec une gravité sans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé, le chancelier parut, précédé du corps des secrétaires, gens subalternes, et précédant lui-même le vice-doge; car le doge étoit malade, et c'est le plus vieux des conseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas sur le trône et n'a pas le corno; il l'imitoit tant qu'il pouvoit, ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet de taffetas noir, dont il ramenoit le sommet par devant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable Anténor. Il étoit suivi de tous les conseillers en robes rouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva; il la salua profondément, sans ôter sa barrette que pour la Quarantie criminelle, lorsqu'il passa devant elle. Seul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avoit sur la tête.\n\nIl monta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et autres, se placèrent autour de lui, et sur les ailes le chancelier, à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le chef. Cette assemblée avoit l'air tout à fait majestueux.\n\nAlors le chancelier se leva et dit que les seigneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini demandoient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs parents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédiatement après, les trois avvogadori prirent chacun un petit évangile, et parcoururent les rangs en faisant toucher à chacun cet évangile du bout du doigt, marque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne foi et sans brigue.\n\nTous ces préalables finis, un grand marsouin d'huissier, ayant mis une paire de lunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'étoit davantage, proclama d'un ton nasillard : « Vexcellentissimo signore Luca Priuli. » À l'instant, une vingtaine de petits enfants rouges, comme ceux de l'hôpital, se dispersèrent par la salle, criant comme des perdus : « Priuli ! Priuli ! » Ils avoient chacun à la main une boîte à deux compartiments, l'un blanc pour nommer, l'autre vert pour refuser; l'ouverture commune étant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne puissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on met la main, et à la ceinture une gibecière pleine de petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemisette; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci la mirent dans celle des enchâtres (compartiments) qu'ils voulurent. Les enfants portèrent leurs boîtes au chancelier, qui versa les ballottes des enchâtres blanches dans un bassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les trois autres concurrents; puis on compta les suffrages. Donato fut élu, et nous sortîmes.\n\nTout cela fut fait avec une rapidité surprenante, et en moins de temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris; mais c'étoit une vraie comédie que de voir, en sortant, les prosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice qu'on lui donnoit. D'honneur, ils sonnoient à se faire entendre au milieu de la place.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 page story in english that enhances the event contained in:[EVENT_De_Brosses], keep everything already present and build around it.

      "content": "Our ambassador, the Comte de Froulay, a man of considerable influence and good humor, had secured us a rare privilege: an invitation to witness a session of the Great Council. This was not a mere formality, but the election of the General of the Galleys, a post of no small importance to a maritime republic. Sainte-Palaye and I, ever keen observers, prepared ourselves for an experience far removed from the salon discussions we usually frequented.\n\nThe morning began, not in the hushed corridors of diplomacy, but amidst the vibrant clamor of the Piazzetta San Marco. It was a spectacle in itself, what the Venetians call the *Broglio*. Though the hour was still early, the square buzzed with a peculiar energy. Nobles, identifiable by their mandatory black *vesta* — long gowns that lent them a solemn, almost clerical air, though many sported fashionable, powdered wigs that seemed anachronistic with their ancient attire — moved with a purpose. They were not merely strolling; they were engaged in a silent, yet intensely active, political dance. Candidates, or their agents, stood on one side, their gazes sweeping the crowd for those patricians whose votes they needed. Electors, in turn, would approach with deep bows, exchanging whispered words, a discreet kiss to a sleeve or a stole, a hand clasp, a barely perceptible nod. The air was thick with unspoken promises, veiled requests for support, and the subtle exchange of influence. I observed several *Barnabotti*, those impoverished nobles living off their inherited right to vote, clustered together, their eyes darting, ready to sell their single commodity to the highest bidder in terms of future favors or a generous meal. It was a fascinating tableau of power and dependency, all conducted beneath a veneer of exaggerated politeness, a testament to the Republic's intricate, yet deeply human, political machinery.\n\nSuddenly, the deep, resonant clang of the *Trottiera* bell cut through the morning's murmur. It was the signal, urging the patricians to gather. The crowd on the Piazzetta began to move, a flowing tide of black robes and bobbing wigs, all heading towards the Giants' Staircase of the Doge's Palace. We joined the stream, ascending the grand marble steps, a path trodden by centuries of Venetian power.\n\nThe Sala del Maggior Consiglio, when we entered, was indeed immense and richly adorned, just as I had heard. Even in August, the sheer volume of the space and the press of bodies made the air heavy, though the large windows offered some respite with views of the lagoon. The ceiling, a riot of gold leaf and painted allegories, seemed to press down with the weight of history, particularly Veronese's \"The Triumph of Venice.\" At the far end, above the raised tribune of the Signoria, Tintoretto’s vast \"Il Paradiso\" loomed, its darkened canvas forming a severe, almost ominous backdrop to the proceedings. The hall, capable of holding well over a thousand patricians, was already filled with a constant, low hum, a \"sabbat de l'autre monde,\" as I noted, that made official announcements almost impossible to discern from the distant benches. Nobles, seemingly without formal order, found their places on the long rows of benches that ran parallel to the walls, leaving a wide central aisle. Those in red robes — the high magistrates, the *Savi*, the *Capi di Quarantia* — had their designated seats, though some strategically dispersed themselves, ostensibly to maintain order, but perhaps also to better gauge the mood of the assembly or to conduct last-minute whispers. In truth, their efforts against the general din were futile; it was an unruly gathering, a perpetual \"peloter en attendant partie\" of jostling and murmuring.\n\nNear the grand Chancellor, upon the elevated platform, stood a finely carved wooden urn. It contained a number of small balls, one for each patrician present, a select few of which were gilded. This was the first, crucial step: the sortition of the electors. One by one, each noble approached the urn. A small boy, perhaps eight years of age, dressed in a simple white tunic, the *Ballottino*, stood beside it. With an air of solemn innocence that belied the tension in the room, he plunged his hand into the urn and drew out a ball for each passing noble. A collective intake of breath, a slight lean forward, a murmur of anticipation accompanied each draw. A gold ball meant participation in the next, more secretive stage of the election; a silver ball meant a return to the benches to await the final vote. Those who drew gold balls, along with certain high-ranking officials who were electors by right of their office, were separated from the main body of the Council.\n\nWith the initial selection completed, we were guided to the Sala dello Scrutinio, an adjacent hall, similarly adorned but noticeably smaller and less crowded. The chosen electors, now a more focused assembly, entered one after another, each performing deep, almost theatrical bows to those already present, a display of unparalleled gravity that underscored the importance of their task.\n\nFinally, the grand procession of the Republic's highest dignitaries made its entrance. The Chancellor, a figure of considerable administrative power, appeared first, followed by a retinue of secretaries, their black robes a stark contrast to the deeper hues of the magistrates. He, in turn, preceded the Vice-Doge. The true Doge, Pisani, was unfortunately indisposed, and so the oldest of the ducal counselors, a venerable man whose face bore the marks of countless councils, represented him. He did not, of course, sit upon the ducal throne, nor did he wear the distinctive corno, the Doge's cap. Instead, he did his best to imitate the ducal presence, his black taffeta barrette, pulled forward into a Phrygian-like point, giving him the appearance of an ancient Antenor. He was flanked by all the other red-robed counselors. As this august group appeared, the entire assembly rose in deference. The Vice-Doge, with a profound bow, acknowledged them all, removing his barrette only once, in a gesture of respect, as he passed before the bench of the Quarantia Criminelle. He alone, of all present, retained his headwear throughout the procession.\n\nHe then ascended the estrade and took his place, not on the Doge's throne, but beside it. The *Savi*—the wise men—the *Capi dei Dieci*, and other high officials settled around him, while the Chancellor positioned himself at the head of his secretaries on one of the side wings. The assembly, now properly constituted, exuded an air of solemn majesty, a stark contrast to the earlier cacophony.\n\nThe Chancellor rose once more, his voice, though still somewhat lost in the vastness of the room, now commanded greater attention. He announced the names of the gentlemen who sought the important charge of General of the Galleys: \"The illustrious Signori Priuli, Badoar, Donato, and Vendramini.\" Immediately, a rustle went through the room as their closest relatives, bound by ancient custom, rose from their seats and withdrew from the hall, preventing any appearance of undue influence. Following this, the three *Avvogadori*—state advocates responsible for upholding the law—each took a small Gospel. They moved through the ranks, ensuring that every elector touched the holy book with the tip of his finger, a solemn oath to proceed with the election in good faith, free from faction or *briga*.\n\nWith these preliminaries concluded, a large, corpulent usher, whom I could only describe as a \"marsouin,\" adjusted a monstrous pair of spectacles upon an even more prodigious nose. His voice, a nasal drone, cut through the remaining murmurs as he proclaimed: \"Vexcellentissimo Signore Luca Priuli!\" At that instant, a score of small boys, dressed in red tunics like those from the *Ospedali*—the orphanages—dispersed themselves throughout the hall. They were the true *Ballottini* for this stage of the election, crying out like lost souls, \"Priuli! Priuli!\" Each child carried a small wooden box with two compartments, one marked in white for \"yes\" (to name) and the other in green for \"no\" (to refuse). The common opening, shaped like a funnel, ensured the secrecy of each vote. From a pouch at their waist, they offered each noble a small, silent linen ball, the *balotta*. Each patrician took a ball and, with a practiced hand, dropped it into the compartment of their choice. The *Ballottini* then dutifully carried their boxes to the Chancellor, who emptied the white balls into a large basin for counting, discarding the green ones.\n\nThe same process was repeated for the three other candidates: Badoar, Vendramini, and finally, Donato. The rhythmic cries of the children, the solemn movements of the nobles, the clatter of the small balls—it all contributed to a unique, almost theatrical ritual. Once all votes were cast, the suffrages were counted. The Chancellor, after a brief consultation, announced the result: \"The most excellent Signore Donato is elected!\"\n\nAnd just as swiftly as it had begun, it was over. We, the foreign observers, were ushered out. The entire procedure, from the first draw of the gold balls to the final announcement, had unfolded with a surprising rapidity, far quicker than the time it took me to recount it in my journal. It truly was a comedy to behold the scene that followed: the newly elected Donato, bowing profoundly, receiving hearty congratulations and \"baisers de nourrice\"—wet, smacking kisses that echoed loudly, even amidst the bustling square outside. It was a vivid, sometimes boisterous, demonstration of Venetian politics, a blend of ancient ritual, shrewd maneuvering, and undeniable theatricality.",

It details the mechanics, atmosphere, and procedures of the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council) in 1740, based on the institutional analysis of Amelot de La Houssaye and historical data regarding the daily life of the Republic.\n\n1. The Space: La Sala del Maggior Consiglio\n\nFor the simulation, the space acts as a constraining environment that dictates movement and social interaction.\n\nArchitecture and Symbolism\n\nDimensions: A massive hall (53m x 25m) free of supporting columns, capable of holding between 1,000 and 2,000 patricians.\nThe Ceiling: Heavy with gold leaf and paintings (notably Veronese’s The Triumph of Venice). It serves as a constant reminder of the divine and state hierarchy.\nThe East Wall (Il Paradiso): Dominated by Tintoretto’s immense canvas, located above the Signoria's tribune. By 1740, the painting had darkened with time, creating a severe backdrop behind the Doge.\nThe Tribune (La Signoria): A raised platform where the Doge, his six counselors, and the three chiefs of the Quarantia sit. They physically overlook the assembly.\nThe Benches (Banchi): Arranged in double rows parallel to the walls, leaving a vast central aisle empty for voting procedures.1\n\nAnnexed Spaces (Crucial for Intrigue)\n\nThe Liagò: A closed loggia or terrace adjacent to the hall. It is a \"decompression\" zone where nobles withdraw to speak freely, negotiate votes away from the Signoria’s gaze, or escape the stifling air of the main hall.2\nThe Sala dello Scrutinio: An adjacent hall often used for counting votes or secondary balloting procedures.3\n\nSensory Atmosphere\n\nAcoustics: The sheer volume of the hall and the number of participants create a constant background hum (buzzing). Official readings by the Chancellor are often inaudible to those seated at the far ends.\nLight and Temperature: The hall is lit by large windows facing the lagoon. In winter, it is notoriously freezing (nobles keep their fur-lined cloaks on). In summer, the heat and the proximity of bodies make the air oppressive.4\n\n2. The Actors: Patrician Sociology (1740)\n\nThe simulation must distinguish between three classes of nobles, who are legally equal but economically and politically divided.\n\nThe Three Classes\n\nThe \"Case Vecchie\" and the Rich: Historic families or immense new fortunes. They monopolize high executive offices (Savi, Council of Ten, Ambassadors). They use the Great Council to validate their power, though real decisions are made in the Senate.5\nThe Middle Nobility: They aim for judicial (Quarantie) and administrative offices. They are often legalistic and attached to procedure.\nThe Barnabotti (The Noble Plebs):\nDefinition: Impoverished nobles, often living in the parish of San Barnaba. They have lost their fortunes but retain their vote in the Council.6\nRole in Simulation: They constitute an electoral maneuver mass. Barred from trade and manual labor, their only \"commodity\" is their vote. They are known to be unruly and to sell their suffrage in exchange for informal gratuities (protection, loans, meals).7\n\nCostume (Visual Code)\n\nThe Vesta (Toga): Mandatory for all. A long black gown with large sleeves (a comito). In winter, it is lined with fur; in summer, it is made of light silk.9\nThe Stola (Stole): A band of black cloth worn over the left shoulder. Its width and lining indicate rank (ordinary for a simple noble, wide and fur-lined for Senators and Councilors).10\nThe Wig: By 1740, the use of the powdered wig is generalized, creating an anachronistic contrast between the medieval costume (toga) and the Rococo hairstyle. High, voluminous wigs are a sign of fashion and wealth.\n\n3. The Political Ritual\n\n\nBefore the Session: The Broglio\n\nLocation: The Piazzetta San Marco, before the bell rings.\nAction: This is the time for electoral solicitation. Candidates (\"solicitors\") stand on one side, electors on the other.12\nGestures: Open campaigning is forbidden by law. Everything occurs through codes of exaggerated politeness: deep bows, kissing of the sleeve or stole, and whispered requests for support (\"Mi raccomando\").12\nThe Trottiera: The specific bell that announces the imminent start of the session, urging latecomers to hasten to the palace.4\n\nDuring the Session: Voting and Chance\n\nThe Venetian system, detailed by Amelot de La Houssaye, relies on a complex mix of Sortition (to prevent factions) and Election (to ensure competence).\n\nThe Tools\n\nThe Ballottino: A boy aged 8 to 10, often dressed in white, tasked with drawing balls from the urns to guarantee the innocence of chance.3\nThe Bussole (Urns): Wooden structures allowing for secret voting. The noble inserts his hand and drops his ball into a hidden tube (the \"Yes\" tube or \"No\" tube).\nThe Balls (Balote): Small balls made of compressed linen (for silence).\nGold: Winning ball (for sortition).\nSilver: Losing ball.\nWhite / Red (or Green): Used for voting \"Yes\" or \"No\" during legislative or judicial scrutinies.3\n\nThe \"Four Hands\" Procedure (Election of Magistrates)\n\nThis is the standard procedure for electing state officials.14\nThe Sortition: Each noble passes before an urn. The Ballottino draws a ball for him. If he gets a Gold ball, he becomes an Elector. This continues until 36 electors are chosen.14\nThe Division: The 36 electors are isolated and divided into 4 groups of 9, called \"Hands\" (Mani).\nThe Nomination (Secret): Each \"Hand,\" isolated in a separate room, must agree (by a majority of 6 out of 9) to propose one candidate for the vacant post.\nThe General Ballot: The 4 names proposed (one by each \"Hand\") are announced to the Great Council. The entire assembly then votes for or against each candidate. The one with the most votes wins.14\n\n4. Simulation Data Cards\n\n\nCard A: Sequence of Actions (Sunday Routine)\n\n10:00 AM - Broglio: Social interaction on the Piazza. Informal negotiations.\n10:30 AM - Trottiera: Sound signal. Crowd movement towards the Giants' Staircase.\n11:00 AM - Installation: Entry into the hall. Barnabotti seek strategic seats or cluster together.\n11:30 AM - Reading: The Chancellor reads the list of vacant posts. Ambient hubbub.\n12:00 PM - Lottery (Ballottino): Slow procession before the urn. Tension of the Gold/Silver draw.\n1:00 PM - Conclave of the 4 Hands: Session suspension for the 36 electors. Others wait, chat in the Liagò.\n2:00 PM - Final Vote: Procession to the Bussole to validate candidates.\n\nCard B: Tension Variables\n\nThese modifiers can be used to generate incidents or intrigues in the simulation.\nCold/Heat: Impatience factor. Can push nobles to rush a vote or leave the session early (if the quorum is not threatened).\nVote Selling: A player may be approached by an agent of a rich family: \"A dinner invitation in exchange for a white ball for candidate Cornaro.\"6\nProcedural Error: If the Ballottino makes a mistake or an urn is improperly closed, the Quarantie (judges) must intervene, creating a dramatic interruption.\n\n5.

DE BLANCEY.\nSéjour à Venise.\n14 août 1739.\nUn bruit assez étrange est venu jusqu'à moi. Seigneur\nOn prétendait tout communément dans Venise\nque mon journal ci-présent ouvrage si respectable,\nn'avait servi, en arrivant vers vous, qu'à égayer\nvotre veine et celle de vos compatriotes, de fort\nméchants propos ; que vous vous étiez émancipés à\nlâcher certains traits de satire contre un travail\naussi distingué par l'utilité des choses qu'il contient,\nque par la précision et la brièveté qui y régnent, et\nque, non contents d'avoir les uns les autres épuisé\nvotre petite ironie sur des écrits qui, à la matière et\nau style près, sont, à coup sûr, irrépréhensibles,\nvous aviez mêlé M. Loppin dans vos railleries ; chose\nque je ne pourrais, ne voudrais ni ne devrais tolé-\nrer. Il est vrai que ce n'est pas un mauvais plaisant,\nni un freluquet comme vos petits messieurs ; mais\n-en récompense, c'est un esprit sensé, un caractère\ndroit, un bon cœur, des vues justes : c'est l'homme\nqui fait face pour nous lorsqu'il est question de doc-\n\n===== Page 2 =====\n\n154 XIV.— A M. DE BLAx\\CEV.\ntrine. En un mot, c'est une téte carrée dont nous\nferions bien de suivre les avis. Ainsi, sur le bruit\nqui courait de ce que dessus, j'allais sans doute\nme gendarmer bien fort ; mais à la vue de votre\nlettre,\nSeigneur je Tai jugé trop peu digne de foi.\nDe sorte que j'ai rengainé bien vite ce qui m'ani-\nmait contre le journal, et qui n'allait pas moins qu'à\nsupprimer, si j'eusse pu, ce gros in-4% que vous\navez reçu en dernier lieu, et tous ceux qui auraient\ndû lui succéder; ce qui faisait, pour vous parler\n• vrai, le sujet de mon ire, c'était de ne point recevoir\nde vos nouvelles; partant, je me suis trouvé coi\nquand j'ai été convaincu de votre exactitude. Il faut\npourtant là-dessus que je vous en croie sur votre\nparole, car je n'ai reçu que votre dernière lettre.\nCelle que vous m'écriviez à Rome n'est pas encore\narrivée. J'espère cependant qu'elle ne sera pas per-\ndue, non plus que d'autres que j'ai reçues par la\nmême voie, et je l'attends avec impatience, dans\nl'espérance d'y trouver des histoires divines.\nIl me semble que je vous devrais au moins autant\nde compliments sur vos réflexions morales que vous\nm'en faites sur mon babil. Vous parlez en homme\npénétré de l'une et de l'autre situation, et cela est\ndans l'ordre; mais votre comparaison, bien qu'ingé-\n*nieuse, n'est pas tout à fait juste. Les récits sont plus exacts à peindre le bien et le mal, que ne le\nsont les relations de voyages. MM. les voyageurs\n\n===== Page 3 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 165\nrarement quittent le ton emphatique en décrivant\nce qu'ils ont vu, quand môme les choses seraient\nmédiocres ; je crois qu'ils pensent qu'il n'est pas de\nla bienséance pour eux d'avoir vu autre chose que\ndu beau. Ainsi, non contents d'exalter des gredi-\nneries, ils passent sous silence tout ce qu'il leur en\na coûté pour jouir des choses vraiment curieuses; de\nsorte qu'un pauvre lecteur, n'imaginant que roses\net que fleurs dans le voyage qu'il va entreprendre,\ntrouve souvent à décompter, et se voit précisément\ndans le cas d'un homme qui serait devenu amoureux\nd'une femme borgne, sur son portrait peint de pro-\nfil. Ne croyez pas cependant par là que je veuille\nexagérer les peines du voyage, qui assurément ne\nsont rien moins qu'intolérables. La plus grande de\ntoutes est d'être séparé des gens de sa connaissance ;\nmais je suis bien aise, puisque j'en trouve l'occasion,\nde décharger un peu ma bile contre les détails con-\ntenus dans les livres de voyages que j'ai actuelle-\nment sous les yeux, dans une partie desquels il n'y\na pas un mot de vrai. Il en est de même de la plu-\npart des idées générales que l'on se forme sur le\nbruit public. Par exemple, tout le monde dit : les\nauberges d'Italie sont détestables; cela n'est pas\nvrai, on est très-bien dans les grandes villes. A la\nvérité, on est très- mal dans les villages; ce n'est pas\nmerveille; il en est de même en France. Mais ce\nqu'on ne dit pas, c'est que le pain, non pétri avec\nles bras, mais battu avec de gros bâtons, quoique\nfait avec de la farine blanche et trèis-fine, est la plus\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\n166 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\ndétestable chose dont un homme puisse goûter; j'en\nsuis désolé. Pour le vin, je m'y fais tant bien que\nmal, en choisissant toujours celui qui est gros et fort\nâpre, par préférence au doux, qui ne peut être com-\nparé qu'au pain, tant il est mauvais. Cependant les\ngens du pays le trouvent exquisissime, et c'est une\nchose à crever de rire que de voiries mines que font\nles dames en goûtant de nos vins de Champagne, et\ncombien elles sont émerveillées de m'en voir avaler\nde grands traits mousseux.\nOn dit encore qu'on a tant qu'on veut la cambia-\ntura; fausseté. Les surintendants des postes la don-\nnent très-diffîcilement, et il faut avoir à chaque\nposte des discussions qui ne finissent point. Le résul-\ntat de tout cela, c'est qu'il faut payer la poste ex-\ncessivement cher, et compter toujours, quand on a\ndestmé une certaine somme à ce voyage-ci, qu'on\ndépensera le triple, encore que notre argent gagne\nen Italie; car, outre Tarticle de la poste et des voitu-\nrins qui sont d'abominables canailles, il y a celui des\nauberges plus chères qu'en France, quoiqu'on ne\nsoupe jamais, et celui que l'on appelle la hiiona man-\ncia, comme nous dirions la bonne main. Ce point ne\nfinit pas ; pour la plus petite chose vous êtes entouré\nde gens qui vous demandent pour boire ; même un\nhomme avec qui on a fait un marché d'un louis trou-\nverait fort singulier, après Fexécution, qu'on ne lui\ndonnât qu'un écu de bonne main. Je m'en plains\n' tous les jours aux gens du pays, qui se contentent de\nplier les épaules en disant : Poveri forestieri c'est-\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 167\nà-dire en langue vulgaire, les étrangers sont faits\npour être volés. Quand j'aurai un peu plus de pra-\ntique de la langue du pays, je mettrai bon ordre à\nce que cela n'arrive plus. Enfin, je ne finirais pas,\nsi je voulais blâmer toutes les erreurs où Ton est sur\nce voyage, et qui ne sont pas mieux fondées que la\njalousie des Italiens, ou la captivité de leurs femmes ;\nmais cette préface n'est déjà que trop longue. Re-\ntournons à nos moutons, c'est-à-dire à notre journal,\nà condition cependant que vous ne le communique-\nrez qu'à peu de personnes ; quand ce seront des gens\ndiscrets comme Bourbonne ou Courtois; mais je\ndéfends les causeurs, à commencer par votre frère.\nJe ne sais si je vous ai conté comment nous par-\ntîmes de Padoue , le 28 du mois dernier. Ce fut eii\nnous embarquant sur le canal de la Brenta, avec lin\nvent contraire; c'est la règle. Mais pour le coup, le\ndiable en fut la dupe, car nous avions de bons che-\nvaux qui nous remorquaient le long du bord, moyen-\nnant quoi nous ingannions le sortilège qui nous\npoursuit. Le bâtiment que nous montions se nomme\nle Bucentaure. Vous pouvez bien penser que ce n'est\nqu'un fort petit enfant du vrai Bucentaure; mais\naussi c'était le plus joli enfant du monde, ressem-\nblant fort en beau à nos diligences d'eau, et infini-\nment plus propre, composé d'une petite antichambre\npour les valets, suivie d'une chambre tapissée de\nbrocatelle de Venise, avec une table et deux estrades\ngarnies de maroquin et ouverte de huit croisées\neffectives et de deux portes vitrées. Nous trouvions\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nm XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY,\nnotre domicile si agréable et si commode, que,\ncontre notre ordinaire, nous n'avions nulle impa-\n• tience d'arriver, d'autant mieux que nous nous étions\nmunis de force vivres, vin de Canarie, etc. ; et que\nles rivages sont bordés de quantité de belles maisons\nde nobles vénitiens. Celle de Pisani, maintenant\ndoge, mérite en vérité une description particulière ,\nsurtout par un portail de jardin au bord de l'eau\naccompagné de deux colonnes qui ont des escaliers\ntournants de fer en dehors, montant sur une terrasse\ncharmante, qui fait le comble du péristyle. Cela est\nimaginé à merveille, et l'on m'a dit depuis que le\ncardinal de Rohan en avait fait prendre le dessin\npour l'exécuter à Saverne. Nous voulions d'abord\ndescendre pour voir ces maisons; le nombre nous\nen rebuta : c'aurait été l'affaire de quelques années.\nCependant nous ne résistâmes pas à la tentation de\nvoir la dernière, qui est sur la route, appartenant\naux Foscarini ; elle a beaucoup de bonnes fresques,\net surtout une Chute des Titans, d'une excellente ex-\npression, de la main de Zelotti. (Notez cependant\nque ceci est encore inférieur aux abords de Gênes.)\nAu bout de quelques milles nous eûmes l'honneur\nd'entrer dans la mer Adriatique , et peu après celui\nd'apercevoir Venise.\nA vous dire vrai , l'abord de cette ville ne me sur-\nprit pas autant que je m'y attendais. Cela ne me fit\npas un autre effet que la vue d'une place située au\nbord de la mer, et Tentrée par le Grand-Canal fut,\nà mon gré, celle de Lyon ou de Paris, par la rivière,\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 169\nMais aussi quand on y est une fois, qu'on voit sortir\nde l'eau de tous côtés des palais, des églises, des\nrues, des villes entières, car il n'y en a pas pour une;\nenfin, de ne pouvoir faire un pas par une ville sans\navoir le pied dans la mer, c'est une chose à mon gré\nsi surprenante, qu'aujourd'hui j'y suis moins fait que\nle premier jour, aussi bien qu'à voir cette ville\nouverte de tous côtés, sans portes, sans fortifications\net sans un seul soldat de garnison, imprenable par\nmer ainsi que parterre; car les vaisseaux de guerre\nn'en peuvent nullement approcher , à cause des la-\ngunes trop basses pour les porter. En un mot, cette\nville-ci est si singulière par sa disposition, ses façons,\nses manières de vivre à faire crever de rire , la li-\nberté qui y règne et la tranquillité qu'on y goûte ,\nque je n'hésite pas à la regarder comme la seconde\nville de l'Europe, et je doute que Rome me fasse re- venir de ce sentiment.\nNous sommes logés, pour ainsi dire, dans le fort\nde la rue Saint-Honoré ; avec cela on peut dormir la\ngrasse matinée sans être interrompu par le moindre\nbruit. Tout s'y passe doucement dans l'eau , et je\ncrois que l'on ronflerait fort bien au milieu du mar-\nché aux herbes. Joignez à cela qu'il n'y a pas dans\nle monde une voiture comparable aux gondoles pour\nla commodité et l'agrément. Je ne trouve pas que\nl'on en ait donné à mon gré une description juste.\nC'est un bâtiment long et étroit comme un poisson ,\nà peu près comme un requin ; au milieu est posée\nune espèce de caisse de carrosse, basse, faite en ber-\n1. . 10\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\n170 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nlingot, et du double plus longue qu'un vis-à-vis : il\nn'y a qu'une seule portière au-devant, par où l'on\nentre. Il y a place pour deux dans le fond , et pour\ndeux autres de chaque côté sur une banquette qui y\nrègne , mais qui ne sert presque jamais que pour\nétendre les pieds de ceux qui sont dans le fond. Tout\ncela est ouvert de trois côtés , comme nos carrosses ,\net se ferme quand on veut , soit par des glaces , soit\npar des panneaux de bois recouverts de drap noir ,\nqu'on fait glisser sur des coulisses, ou rentrer par le\ncôté dans le corps de la gondole. Je ne sais pas trop\nsi je me fais entendre. Le bec d'avant de la gondole\nest armé d'un grand fer en col de grue, garni de six\nlarges dents de fer. Cela sert à la tenir en équilibre,\net je compare ce bc à la gueule ouverte du requin,\nbien que cela y ressemble comme à un moulin à\nveut. Tout le bateau est peint en noir et verni ; la\ncaisse doublée de velours noir en dedans et de drap\nnoir en dehors , avec les coussins de maroquin de\nmême couleur, sans qu'il soit permis aux plus grands\nseigneurs d'en avoir une différente, en quoi que ce\nsoit, de celle du plus petit particulier ; de sorte qu'il\nne faut pas songer à deviner qui peut être dans une\ngondole fermée. On est là comme dans sa chambre,\nà lire, écrire, converser, caresser sa maltresse, man--\nger, boire, etc., toujours faisant des visites par la\nville. Deux hommes , d'une fidélité à toute épreuve,\nl'un à l'avant, l'autre à l'arrière, vous conduisent\nsans vous voir, si vous ne voulez.\nJe n'espère plus de me retrouver de sang-froid\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 171\ndans un carrosse, après avoir tkié de ceci. J'avais\nouï dire qu'il n'y avait jamais d'embarras de gon-\ndoles , comme il y en a de voitures à Paris ; mais au\ncontraire rien n'est plus commun , surtout dans les\nrues étroites et sous les ponts ; à la vérité ils sont de\npeu de durée, la flexibilité de l'eau donne une\ngrande facilité pour s'en débarrasser. Outre cela, nos\ncochers d'ici sont si adroits, qu'ils glissent on ne sait\ncomfnent, et tournent en un coup de main cette lon-\ngissime machine , sur la pointe d'une aiguille. Ces\nvoitures vont vite , mais non pas autant que le car-\nrosse d'un petit maître. Cependant ne vous avisez\npas de tenir la tète hors de votre gondole ; la gueule\ndu requin d'une autre gondole qui passerait vous la\ncouperait net comme un navet. Le nombre des gon-\ndoles est infini , et l'on ne compte pas moins de\nsoixante mille personnes qui vivent de la rame , soit\ngondoliers ou autres. On dit aussi, pour faire valoir\nl'agrément du séjour, que la ville a toujours un fonds\nde trente mille étrangers. Cela peut avoir quelque\nfondement pendant les six mois de carnaval ; mais\nhors de là, je crois ce nombre fort exagéré.\nVous croyez peut-être que la place Saint-Marc ,\ndont on parle tant, est aussi grande que d'ici à de-\nmain. Rien moins que cela ; elle est fort au-dessous,\ntant pour la grandeur que pour le coup d'œil des\nbâtiments de la place Vendôme , bien que magnifi-\nquement bâtie ; mais elle est régulière , carrée ,\nlongue , terminée des deux bouts par les éghses de\nSaint-Marc et de San-Geminiano, et des côtés par\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\n111 XIV.— A M.

Ces dernières for-\nment un magnifique bâtiment, tout d'un corps de\nlogis d'une très-grande longueur, orné d'architec-\nture, et le comble couvert de statues. Tant les Neuves\nque les Vieilles sont bâties sur des arcades, sous les-\nquelles on se promène à couvert, et chaque arcade\nsert d'entrée à un café qui ne désemplit point. La\nplace est pavée de pierres de taille. On ne peut s'y\ntourner, à ce qu'on dit, pendant le carnaval, à cause\nde la quantité de masques et de théâtres. Pour moi ,\nqui n'ai pas vu cela, je l'en trouve actuellement tou-\njours pleine. Les robes de palais, les manteaux, les\nrobes de chambre, les Turcs, le Grecs, lesDalmates,\nles Levantins de toute espèce, hommes et femmes ,\nles tréteaux de vendeurs d'orviétan , de bateleurs ,\nde moines qui prêchent , et de marionnettes ; tout\ncela, dis-je , qui y est tout ensemble , à toute heure,\nla rendent la plus belle et la plus curieuse place du\nmonde , surtout par le retour d'équerre qu'elle fait\nauprès de Saint- Marc, ce que l'on nomme Broglio.\nC'est une autre place plus petite que la première ,\nformée par le palais Saint-Marc et le retour du bâti-\nment des Procuraties-Neuves. La mer, large en cet\nendroit, la termine. C'est de là qu'on voit le mélange\ndéterre, de mer, de gondoles, de boutiques, de\nvaisseaux et d'églises , de gens qui partent et qui\narrivent à chaque instant.

Je ne parle pas de la chose\ndont nos plaisirs et nous tirons notre origine, de la\nchose proprement dite par excellence. On ne s'en\nchoque pas plus ici que de toute autre opération na-\nturelle.

Cependant le sang est si doux ici, que, malgré\nla facilité que donnent les masques, les allures de\nnuit, les rues étroites et surtout les ponts sans garde-\nfous, d'où l'on peut pousser un homme dans la mer\nsans qu'il s'en aperçoive, il n'arrive pas quatre acci-\ndents par an; encore n'est-ce qu'entre étrangers.\nVous pouvez juger par là combien les idées que l'on\na sur les stylets vénitiens sont mal fondées aujour-\nd'hui.\nIl en est à peu près de même de leur jalousie pour\nleurs femmes : cependant cela mérite explication.\nDès qu'une fille, entre nobles, est promise, elle met\nun masque, et personne ne la voit plus que son fu-\ntur, ou ceux à qui il le permet, ce qui est fort rare.\nEn se mariant, elle devient un meuble de commu-\nnauté pour toute la famille, chose assez bien imagi-\nnée, puisque cela supprime l'embarras de la précau-\ntion, et que l'on est sûr d'avoir des héritiers du sang.\nC'est souvent l'apanage du cadet de porter le nom\nde mari ; mais, outre cela, il est de règle qu'il y ait\nun amant; ce serait même une espèce de déshonneur\nà une femme si elle n'avait pas un homme publique-\nment sur son compte. Mais, halte là; la politique a\ntrès-grande part à ceci. La famille en use comme le\nroi de France à l'élection de l'abbé de Clteaux ; on\nlaisse choisir la femme en donnant l'exclusion à tels\nou tels. Il ne faut pas qu'elle s'avise de prendre au-\ncun autre qu'un noble, et parmi ceux-ci, un homme\nqui ait entrée dans le Pregadi ou Sénat et dans les\nconseils, dont la famille soit assez puissante pour\n\n===== Page 14 =====\n\n176 XIV.— A M.

Avec cela,\nune femme a la liberté tout entière, et peut faire\ntout ce qu'elle veut. Il faut cependant rendre justice\nà la vérité ; notre ambassadeur me disait, l'autre\njour, qu'il ne connaissait pas plus d'une cinquan-\ntaine de femmes de qualité qui couchassent avec leurs\namants. Le reste est retenu par la dévotion. Les con-\nfesseurs ont traité avec elles, qu'elles s'abstiendraient\nde l'article essentiel; moyennant quoi, ils leur font\nbon marché du reste tout aussi loin qu'il puisse s'é- tendre.\nVoilà quel est le train courant de la galanterie, où\nles étrangers n'ont pas beau jeu. Les nobles ne les\nadmettent guère ni dans leurs maisons ni dans leurs\nparties. Hs veulent vivre entre eux, et avoir leurs\ncoudées franches, pour parler devant leurs femmes,\nde brigues et de ballottages, articles sur lesquels le\ntacet s'observe exactementdevant l'étranger. Cepen-\ndant, lorsque deux personnes s'entendent, il n'est\npas impossible de faire un coup fourré à la faveur des\ngondoles, où les dames entrent toujours seules sans\nsurveillants; c'est un asile sacré. Il est inouï qu'un\ngondolier de Madame se soit laissé gagner par Mon-\nsieur ; il serait noyé le lendemain par ses camarades.\nCette pratique actuelle des dames a beaucoup dimi-\nnué les profits des religieuses, qui étaient jadis en\npossession de la galanterie. Cependant il y en a en-\ncore bon nombre qui s'en tirent aujourd'hui avec\n\n===== Page 15 =====\n\nSÉJOUR ENISE. 177\ndistinction, je pourrais dire avec émulation ; puisque,\nactuellement que je vous parle, il y a une furieuse\nbrigue entre trois couvents de la ville, pour savoir\nlequel aura l'avantage de donner une maîtresse au\nnouveau nonce qui vient d'arriver. En vérité, ce se-\nrait du côté des religieuses que je me tournerais le\nplus volontiers, si j'avais un long séjour à faire ici.\nToutes celles que j'ai vues à la messe, au travers de\nla grille, causer (ant qu'elle durait et rire ensemble,\nm'ont paru jolies au possible et mises de manière à\nfaire bien valoir leur beauté. Elles ont une petite\ncoiffure charmante, un habit simple, mais bien en<\ntendu, presque toujours blanc, qui leur découvre les\népaules et la gorge, ni plus ni moins que les habits à\nla romaine de nos comédiennes.\nPour épuiser l'article du sexe féminin il convient\nici plus qu'ailleurs de vous dire un mot de5 courti-\nsanes. Elles composent un corps vraiment respecta-\nble par les bons procédés. Il ne faut pas croire en-\ncore, comme on le dit, que le nombre en soit si grand\nque l'on marche dessus ; cela n'a lieu que pendant le\ntemps de carnaval, où l'on trouve sous les arcades des\nProcuraties autant de femmes couchées que debout ;\nhors de là, leur nombre ne s'étend pas à plus du dou-\nble de ce qu'il y en a à Paris ; mais aussi elles sont\nfort employées. Tous les jours régulièrement à vingt-\nquatre ou vingt-quatre heures et demie au plus tard,\ntoutes sont occupées. Tant pis pour ceux qui viennent\ntrop tard. A la différence de celles de Paris, toutes\nsont d'une douceur d'esprit et d'une politesse char*\n\n===== Page 16 =====\n\n178 XIV.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nmantes. Quoi que vous leur demandiez, leur -réponse\nest toujours : Sarà servito, sono a suoi commandi\n(car il est de la civilité de ne parler jamais aux gens\nqu'à la troisième personne.) A la vérité, vu la répu-\ntation dont elles jouissent, les demandes qu'on leur\nfait ordinairement sont fort bornées ; cependant j'en\ntrouvai l'autre jour une si jolie qu xxxx Le moyen\nde ne pas s'y fier, elle me répondait des conséquences\nper la beatissima madonna di Loreto.\nNous avons eu quelque peine à nous mettre un peu\ndans le beau monde ; nous sommes arrivés dans des\ncirconstances défavorables. La sérénissime républi-\nque venait de faire main basse sur près de cinq cents\ncourtiers d'amour qui, abusant de leur ministère\npublic, s'en allaient offrir à tous venants, sur la place\nSaint-Marc, madame la procuratesse celle-ci, ou ma-\ndame la chevalière celle-là ; de sorte qu'il arrivait\nquelquefois à un mari de s'entendre proposer sa\nfemme. On a réformé cette licence trompeuse et in-\nsolente. Néanmoins il ne faut pas être en peine de\nvivre aujourd'hui, pour peu qu'on choisisse bien ses\ngondoliers, et ce choix est si aisé, qu il faut être d'un\ngrand guignon pour le faire mal. Il vient de m'arri-\nver à ce sujet une plaisante aventure, qui m'a mis\npour un moment dans un embarras fort risible.\nJ'avais envoyé hier un gondolier faire Vambasciata\nà la célèbre Bagatina. Le rendez-vous était pris chez\nelle à une heure marquée. Je ne la trouvai point ; sa\nfemme de chambre me dit qu'elle avait été obligée\nde sortir avec une dame de ses amies, pour aller à la\n\n===== Page 17 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 179\nconversation chez je ne sais quel seigneur, et qu'elle\nm'en faisait excuse, me priant de revenir le lende-\nmain. Pendant ce discours, j'examinais un apparte-\nment vaste, magnifique, richement orné, et parais-\nsant fort au-dessus de l'état d'une pareille princesse.\nJe demandai à la femme de chambre si un tel gon-\ndolier n'était pas venu de ma part parler à la Baga-\ntina. Elle me répondit que le gondolier était venu\nen effet ; mais que sa maltresse ne s'appelait point\nBagatina, mais bien Abbati Marcheze, et qu'elle était\nla femme d'un noble vénitien. Mais, lai ai-je dit,\nqu'est-ce que votre maîtresse a pensé que je voulais\nd'elle ? Que vous aviez quelque lettre de recomman-\ndation à lui remettre, a-t-elle repris. Vous êtes le\nmaître, monsieur, de me la laisser ou de revenir de-\nmain, si cela vous plaît. Là-dessus j'ai fait monter le\ngondolier ; la soubrette et lui ont persisté en leur\ndire, chacun de leur côté. Le gondolier a été traité\nde birbante et de ladite ; et j'ai été congédié avec\nforce révérences, assez incertain si je retournerais le\nlendemain, et de ce que pouvait signifier un pareil\nquiproquo. Enfin je me suis déterminé à risquer le\npaquet, et j'y suis retourné aujourd'hui. J'ai trouvé\nune grande femme bien faite, d'environ trente-cinq\nans, de grand air, d'un bon maintien, magnifique-\nment vêtue et chargée de pierreries, qui, s'avançant\nà moi d'un air très-grave, m'a demandé ce que je\nsouhaitais d'elle. Je le savais assez, et mon embarras\nne roulait que sur la manière de le lui dire. Je lui ai\nbaragouiné un compliment inintelligible dans le plus\n\n===== Page 18 =====\n\n180 Xiy.— À M. DE BLANCEY.\nmauvais italien que j'ai pu, et cela ne m'est pas dif-\nficile. Enfin, s'aperce vaut de ce qui causait mon in-\ncertitude, elle a eu le bon procédé de la lever elle-\nmême au bout d'un instant, en quittant son faux nom\net sa fausse décence \\ Elle a même eu l'air surpris de\nma libéralité ; car, en faveur du meuble et de l'ha-\nbillement, j'ai doublé les sequins, ne voulant pas avoir rien mis de médiocre dans une main ornée de\ndiamants. Les nobles, j'entends ceux qui ne sont pas\nd'un goût plus raffiné, font grand usage de ces prin-\ncesses. Quand l'un d'eux veut faire une partie de\npromenade avec la sienne, elle vient tout uniment le\nprendre dans sa gondole au sortir du conseil, et l'on\nn'est pas plus surpris de l'y voir monter avec elle en\npleine place Saint-Marc qu'on ne l'a été, en temps\nde carnaval, de voir ce noble ôter son masque et son\ndomino dans l'antichambre du Conseil, pour y en-\ntrer. Ma foi ! ils ont raison, c'est un doux séjour de\njouissance qu'une gondole. Au surplus, ne croyez\npas que, malgré la fidélité dont elles se piquent pour\nleurs tenants, elles soient inaccessibles. Ce scrupule\nne dure jamais que cinq jours de la semaine ; leurs\namants mêmes leur laissent presque toujours toute\nliberté le vendredi, parce qu'ils font leurs dévotions,\net le samedi, parce qu'ils ont affaire au Pregadi.\nElles ont un usage politique assez bien trouvé, c'est\n* E poi che la sua mono alla mia pose\nCou lieto volto, onde mi conforiai ,\nMi mise flintro aile segrete rose.\nDantk.\n\n===== Page 19 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 181\nde ne rien accorder qu'à la seconde entrevue, parce\nque, disent-elles, il faut connaître avant que d'aimer.\nAu moyen de ce, on leur fait au moins deux visites,\net elles reçoivent des appointements doubles pour\nun seul service. Je crois que voilà un chapitre traité\nà fond. Je l'ai fait de la sorte en votre faveur, parce\nque je sais que vous êtes fort vicieux, et afin que vous\nn'ayez rien à désirer, j'ajouterai que les femmes sont\nplus belles ici qu'en aucun autre endroit, surtout\nparmi le peuple. Ce n'est pas qu'on y trouve plus\nqu'ailleurs des beautés ravissantes ; mais communé-\nment le grand nombre est joli et en général elles ont\ntoutes la taille et le teint beaux, la bouche grande et\nagréable, les dents blanches et bien rangées.\nXV. — A M. DE NEUILLY.\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n0 août.\nLa noblesse de Venise est, si je ne me trompe, la\nplus ancienne de l'Europe (j'entends les premières\nmaisons), puisqu'il en subsiste plusieurs de celles qui\nélurent le premier doge, il y a plus de treize cents ans.\nIls ont, tant dans l'ancienne que dans la moderne\nnoblesse, entre laquelle, par parenthèse, il n'y a\npoint de différence comme à Gênes, beaucoup de\nfamilles puissamment riches ; bien entendu que la\nrépublique met bon ordre à ce qu'elles ne le devien- I. 11\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\n182 XV. -A M.

Par exemple, en dernier lieu, la\nPisani, héritière de 150,000 ducats de rente, vou-\nlait se marier à un homme de son nom presque\naussi riche qu'elle ; non -seulement l'Etat le lui a\ndéfendu, mais il l'a obligée d'en épouser un autre\nqui n'avait rien. Cette noblesse se perpétue sûre-\nment, et prouve sa descendance par le repristre\nappelé le Livre dor où l'on inscrit tous les nobles\nqui naissent ; ceux qui auraient omis de s'y faire\ninscrire ne seraient pas nobles; aussi y a-t-il des\ncitadins qui, quoique petits bourgeois, sont de la\nplus ancienne noblesse; ce qui vient de ce qu'en\non ferma tout d'un coup le Livre d'or , moyennant\nquoi il n'y a eu que ceux qui y étaient inscrits alors et\nleurs descendants qui ont été nobles. Tous ceux qui\navaient négligé de s'y faire inscrire furent exclus,\net n'ont pas aujourd'hui plus de prérogatives que\nles autres citadins* Ce n'est pas beaucoup dire assu-\nrément, car cet ordre est assez mal mené par le\ngouvernement, et plus encore les gentilshommes\nde terre ferme. En récompense, le menu peuple\nest traité avec une extrême douceur; la raison de\nces deux points de politique n'est pas difficile à deviner.\n' Les nobles portent pour habillement un jupon de\n1 La noblesse devenant de jour en jour plus pauvre, le sénat\nfut contraint, en 1775, de rouvrir \\e Livre d'or.

Quelques-\nuns de ceux qui sont en dignité la portent rouge,\nd'autres violette. Tous portent sur l'épaule une aune\nde drap de couleur assortissante, placée dans la vraie\nposition de la serviette d'un maître d'hôtel et sont\ncoiffés d'une perruque si démesurée, qu'en vérité\ncelle de M. Bernardon n'est plus qu'un toquet. Ils\nportent à la main une barrette de drap ou de taffetas\nnoir, faite comme nos coiffes de bonnets de nuit. La\nmanche de la robe fait encore une distinction ; plus\nla dignité est grande, plus la manclie est large (et\ncette manche n'est pas inutile pour mettre la provi-\nsion de boucherie avec une salade dans le grand\nbonnet). La manche du doge, comme de raison,\nexcède le panier d'une femme : elle est de drap d'or,\nainsi que la robe. La façon la plus humble de saluer\nles nobles est d'aller solliciter au BrogliOj et de\nbaiser la manche de celui qu'on sollicite. L'art des\nrévérences est encore un grand point : il faut les\nfaire bas, bas ; encore n'en fait-on aucun compte si\nla perruque ne traîne pas à terre d'un bon demi-\npied. Le manteau est un habillement plus commun\nencore que la robe. Tout homme qui, par son état,\nest au-dessus de l'artisan, est moins dispensé de le\nporter quand il sort, quelque chaud qu'il fasse, que\nnous ne le sommes de porter une culotte ; mais\naussi, comme chez nos femmes qui sont revenues\n\n===== Page 22 =====\n\n184 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\ndu monde, c'est-à-dire dont le monde est revenu,\nle manteau de la dévotion couvre tout. Ici le simple\nmanteau de bouracan fait le même effet. On porte\ndessous tout ce qu'on veut, et vous ne trouverez\nautre chose à la messe ou dans la place que des gens\nen pantoufles et en robe de chambre avec leur man-\nteau par-dessus. Les nobles le portent quand ils\nn'ont pas leur robe, et alors ils sont censés être\nincognito par les rues; mais, comme dit Trajano\nBoccalini : ce II manto délia religione non è in questo\ntanto lungo, che spesse volte non si vedano per di\nsotto due palme di gambe di ladro. » C'est aussi\ndans cet équipage qu'ils vont souvent le soir aux\nassemblées; surtout on ne doit point le quitter; il\nfaut, ribonfredon, faire sa partie de quadrille d'un bout à Tautre en manteau, et étouffer avec décence.\nJ'ai vu le vieux bonhomme doge Pisani prendre Tair\nsur le perron d'un casino dans cet habillement, avec\nune petite perruque bardachine. Il avait tout à fait\nl'air d'un jouvenceau; à la vérité il était malade\nalors et prenait l'air pour sa santé.\n(est une chose originale et bien occupante pour\nles nobles que l'intrigue de leur Broglio, Il y a des\ndessous de cartes admirables. On vient de me con-\nter le détail d'une aventure arrivée en dernier lieu,\nqui fait du bruit ici ; c'est à mon avis un bon conte.\nMonsieur ilfaut que je vous en fasse récit, sans vous\ngarantir les circonstances , quoique je les tienne\nd'un des ambassadeurs qui sont ici; mais vous\nn'ignorez pas jusqu'à quel point je pousse le scru-\n\n===== Page 23 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 185\npule de la fidélité historique, et que je suis incapable\nde rien assurer, même dans mon histoire des ancien-\nnes dynasties assyriennes, dont je n'aie été moi-même\nle témoin oculaire. Il faut donc que vous sachiez\nque le procurateur Tiepolo , à qui nous sommes\nrecommandés ici, et le procureur Aimo sont deux\npersonnages d'une grande autorité dans l'Etat et\nfort antagonistes l'un de l'autre. Le premier, qui est\nde la plus haute noblesse, a grand crédit dans le\nSénat, et l'autre, qui n'est pas si distingué par sa\nnaissance, a plus de pouvoir dans le Grand-Conseil,\nparce que c'est l'assemblée générale des nobles.\nC'est le Sénat qui nomme aux charges ; mais il faut\nque le Grand-Conseil confirme l'élection, sans quoi\nelle est nulle. 11 y a quelque temps que Tiepolo bri-\nguait une place dans le conseil des Dix, et Aimo, ne\nsachant comment le faire rejeter, prit le biais, sous\nprétexte de bonne manière, de faire d'abord nommer\nun autre Tiepolo, bonhomme qui ne songeait à rien,\net à qui certainement on aurait encore moins songé.\nLe procurateur Tiepolo fut fort sensible à cette poli-\ntesse, et retira ses cornes, parce que la loi ne permet\npas qu'il y ait deux personnes du même nom dans\nle conseil des Dix ; mais il jura bien de rendre à\nl'autre sa galanterie. Pour cet effet il fit nommer le\nfrère d'Aimo, personnage qui avait passé dans les\nplus grandes charges, podestat de Vicence. C'est\nune place que l'on donne aux commençants âgés de\nvingt ans, et c'est à peu près comme si Ton faisait\nle premier président avocat du roi au Châtelet.\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\n186 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nAimo le cadet cria comme un enragé, que c'était\nune berne, et qu'il n'y voulait point aller. Il eut\nbeau jurer, il fallut payer l'amende de 1,000 ducats,\nréglée contre ceux qui refusent des magistratures,\net aller en exil pour un an. Il revint d'un grand\nsang-froid au bout de l'année; mais le narquois de\nTiepolo l'attendait à l'affût et le fit nommer podestat\nde Padoue. La récidive est un peu plus chère ; elle\ncoûte 2,000 ducats et deux années de bannissement.\nAimo, pénétré de douleur, s'en allait chercher l'ar-\ngent chez lui, quand son frère le procurateur l'ar-\nrêta, lui fit entendre que ces plaisanteries-là ne fini-\nraient point et qu'il fallait qu'il allât à Padoue, lui\ndonnant sa parole que dans six mois il le ferait nom-\nmer provéditeur général de la mer, qui est une des\nplus grandes charges de l'Etat. En effet, cette place\na été vacante dans ce temps. Nous venions alors d'ar-\nriver. Aimo l'a publiquement briguée pour son frère,\net ïiepolo lui a donné pour compétiteur Loredano,\nhomme d'une grande distinction. Vous autres, bon-\nnes gens, auriez cru qu'il allait tout uniment faire\nnommer Loredano au Sénat, où sa faction était pré-\ndominante; nullement, cette voie est trop simple\npour ces gens-ci, et de plus le Grand-Conseil aurait\nbien pu détruire son ouvrage. Le biais qu'il prit fut\nau contraire de faire refuser tout à plat Loredano et\nnommer son ennemi. Mais quand il fat question\nd'aller au Grand-Conseil, Loredano dit : « Messieurs,\n((je viens d'avoir du dessous dans l'endroit où\n(( j'avais le plus beau jeu, à plus forte raison l'au-\n\n===== Page 25 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 187\n« rai-je ici. Je demande donc, au cas que je sois\n(( refusé, d'être nommé à la seconde place, qui est\n(( celle de provéditeur de Dalmatie. » Alors tous\nceux qui prétendaient à cette place ouvrirent les\noreilles, bien résolus de faire agir leur faction pour\nse délivrer d'un concurrent si redoutable, en le fai-\nsant nommer à la première. De cette sorte, Loredano\nse rendit aussi puissant que son concurrent. Pour\nemporter la balance, il s'avança une seconde fois,\ndemandant, en cas de refus de l'une et l'autre place,\nl'ambassade de Constantinople, ce qui produisit le\nmême effet pour ceux qui y prétendaient. Moyennant\nquoi il fut nommé, au Grand-Conseil, provéditeur\ngénéral, et le pauvre Aimo, qui ne pouvait plus\nbriguer les places inférieures qu'il avait déjà possé-\ndées, est demeuré à ronger ses doigts à Padoue.\nAn surplus, notez que la charge ne pouvait tomber\nqu'en très-bonnes mains, et que ces gens-ci sont\ntrop sages pour faire rouler ces sortes de jeux sur\nd'autres que sur de très-bons sujets. J'ai eu le\nplaisir d'avoir mon cœur clair de leur façon de bal-\nlotter les charges.\nOn nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand-\nConseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères ;\ncharge assez importante. Le Grand-Conseil se tient\ndans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond\nest une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et\ndes inquisiteurs d'État , avec le trône du doge au\nmilieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de\nla salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns\n\n===== Page 26 =====\n\n188 Xy.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\naux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle.\nTous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se pla-\ncèrent. Les robes rouges avaient leurs places mar-\nquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents\nlieux de la salle , pour empêcher qu'il ne se fit du\nbruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée ; chose , à\nmon gré , où ils ne réussirent nullement , puisque\nTon y faisait un sabbat de l'autre monde ; aussi ne\nfaisait-on là que peloter en attendant partie. Près du\ngrand chancelier , sur l'estrade , il y avait une urne\ncontenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avait de\npersonnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de\ndorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent\ncelles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en\nquestion, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par\nleurs places , étaient électeurs de droit. Cela fait ,\nnous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin , ornée de la\nmême manière que la première, moins grande, rem-\nplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse.\nLes autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre , sa-\nluant jusqu'à terre les précédents avec une gravité\nsans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé , le chan-\ncelier parut précédé du corps des secrétaires , gens\nsubalternes , et précédant lui-même le vice-doge ;\ncar le doge était malade , et c'est le plus vieux des\nconseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas\nsur le trône et n*a pas le corno ; il Timitait tant qu'il\npouvait , ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet\nde taffetas noir , dont il ramenait le sommet par-\ndevant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable\n\n===== Page 27 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 189\nAnténor. Il était suivi de tous les conseillers en robes\nrouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva ; il\nla salua profondément sans ôter sa barrette que pour\nla Qua?'antie crimineWe, lorsqu'il passa devant elle.\nSeul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avait surla téte. Il\nmonta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et\nautres se placèrent autour de lui , et sur les ailes le\nchancelier à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le\nchef. Cette assemblée avait l'air tout à fait majes-\ntueux. Alors le chancelier se leva et dit que les sei-\ngneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini deman-\ndaient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs\nparents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédia-\ntement après, les trois i4î;t'o6/on prirent chacun un\npetit Évangile , et parcoururent les rangs en faisant\ntoucher à chacun cet Evangile du bout du doigt ,\nmarque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne\nfoi et sans brigue. Tous ces préalables finis , un\ngrand marsouin d'huissier , ayant mis une paire de\nlunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'était davan-\ntage, proclama d'un ton nasillard Veccellentissimo\nsignore Luca Priuli. A l'instant une vingtaine de\npetits enfants rouges comme ceux de l'hôpital se dis-\npersèrent par la salle , criant comme des perdus :\nPriuli ! Priuli ! Ils avaient chacun à la main une\nboite à deux compartiments , l'un blanc pour nom-\nmer, l'autre vert pour refuser ; l'ouverture commune\nétant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne\npuissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on\nmet la main , et à leur ceinture une gibecière pleine\nI. 11.\n\n===== Page 28 =====\n\n190 XV.— A M. DE NEUILLY.\nde petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemi-\nsette ; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci\nla mirent dans celle des enchàtres qu'ils voulurent.\nLes enfants portèrent leurs boites au chancelier, qui\nversa les ballottes des enchàtres blanches dans un\nbassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les\ntrois autres concurrents ; puis on compta les suf-\nfrages. Donato fut élu et nous sortîmes. Tout cela\nfut fait avec une rapidité surprenante , et en moins\nde temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris ; mais\nc'était une vraie comédie que de voir en sortant les\nprosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice\nqu'on lui donnait. D'honneur, ils sonnaient à se faire\nentendre au milieu de la place.\nJ'ai aussi vu ce que l'on appelle une fonction,\nc'est-à-dire une cérémonie où tous les grands magis-\ntrats vont en corps à une fête d'église. Je ne vous\nen parlerai guère, car cela ne vaut pas mieux que la\nprocession de la sainte hostie ; le cortège des ambassa-\ndeurs en est le principal ornement. Ils y assistent à\ncôté du doge avec leur maison ; mais ce qu'il y a de\nmieux, c'est la marche.\nUne procession en gondoles est à mon gré un\nmorceau divin , d'autant mieux que ce ne sont point\nalors des gondoles ordinaires , mais celles de la ré-\npublique, superbement sculptées et dorées , accom-\npagnées de celles des ambassadeurs, plus riches et\nplus galantes encore, surtout celle du nôtre. Ils sont\nles seuls dans l'Etat à qui il soit permis d'en avoir\nqui ne soient pas noires. Les gondoliers de la répu-\n\n===== Page 29 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 191\nblique sont tous en chapes de velours rouge , cha-\nmarrées d'or, avec de grands bonnets à l'albanaise.\nIls sont trop fiers de cet équipage pour se donner la\npeine de ramer. Aussi se font-ils remorquer bien et\nbeau par des petits bateaux remplis d'instruments de\nmusique.\nC'est assez parler de choses publiques; j'aurais\nbien de la peine à en dire autant des maisons parti-\nculières. Ici les étrangers n'ont pas trop beau jeu là- dessus. Messieurs les nobles viennent le soir au café\noù ils causent de fort bonne amitié avec nous; mais,\npour nous introduire dans leurs maisons, c'est une\nautre affaire. Avec cela il y a ici fort peu de maisons\noù l'on tienne assemblée, et ces assemblées ne sont\nni nombreuses ni amusantes pour des étrangers. On\nn'y a pas même la ressource du jeu; car il faudrait\nêtre pis que sorcier pour connaître leurs cartes, qui\nn'ont ni le nom ni la figure des nôtres. Les Véni-\ntiens, avec tout leur faste et leurs palais, ne savent\nce que c'est que de donner un poulet à personne, j'ai\nété quelquefois à la conversation chez la procura-\ntesse Foscarini , maison d'une richesse immense, et\nfemme très-gracieuse d'ailleurs; pour tout régal,\nsur les trois heures c'est-à-dire à onze heures du\nsoir de France vingt valets apportent dans un plat\nd'argent démesuré une grosse citrouille coupée en\nquartiers, que l'on qualifie du nom de melon d'eau,\nmets détestable s'il en fut jamais. Une pile d'as-\nsiettes d'argent l'accompagnent ; chacun se jette sur\nun quartier, prend par-dessus une petite tasse de\n\n===== Page 30 =====\n\n192 XV.— A M.

Je vous dirai franche-\nment qu'un des grands désagréments du voyage est\nde n'avoir pas, quand le soir vient, ses bonnes Pous-\nselines, son gros Blancey, son bon Quintin , ses amis\nMaleteste et Bévy, sa dame Courtois, ces excellentes\npetites dames de Montot et Bourbonne ; enfin tout\nnotre petit cercle, pour tenir, les coudes sur la table,\ndes propos de cent piques au-dessus de la place\nSaint-Marc et du Broglio, Il faut s'attendre, en pays\nétranger, à avoir les yeux satisfaits et le cœur en-\nnuyé ; de l'amusement de curiosité tant qu'il vous\nplaira, mais des ressources de société, aucune. Vous\nne vivez qu'avec des gens pour qui vous êtes sans\nintérêt, comme ils le sont pour vous. Et, quelque\naimables qu'ils fussent d'ailleurs, le moyen d'en\nprendre réciproquement la peine, quand on songe\nque l'on doit se quitter sous peu de jours, pour ne se\nrevoir jamais.\nIci notre principale ressource a été dans notre\nambassadeur, de qui nous recevons toutes sortes de\nbons traitements. C'est le comte de Froulay, qui\nrépare fort bien ici l'honneur de la nation, qui avait\nété un peu maléficié par son prédécesseur. Il nous a\nmenés plusieurs fois à sa maison de campagne en\nterre ferme, qui est vraiment fort belle, et nous a\ndonné l'accointance de tous les ambassadeurs ;\nmoyennant quoi notre porte est fort honorée des\nvisites de leurs excellences, et notre appétit fort satis-\nfait des festins dont ils nous régalent, surtout l'am-\n\n===== Page 31 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 193\nbassadeur de Naples, qui est un ribaud des plus\nfrancs que l'on puisse voir, fort honnête prêtre d'ail-\nleurs, homme de bonne compagnie et sans façon. Le\nmétier d'ambassadeur est assez triste ici ; ils n'ont de\nressource que celle de vivre ensemble, et ne peuvent\nabsolument voir aucun noble, auxquels il est dé-\nfendu, sous peine de mort, d'entrer chez eux. Ceci\nn'est point comminatoire, et l'on a vu un noble exé-\ncuté à mort, seulement pour avoir traversé la mai-\nson d'un ambassadeur, sans parler à personne, pour\naller voir en secret sa maltresse. Du reste, les am-\nbassadeurs ont de très-grands droits, entre autres,\nun fort particulier, d'avoir autour de leurs maisons\nun quartier de franchise très-étendu, où l'on ne peut\narrêter personne sans leur permission, et où ils exer-\ncent souverainement la police et la justice. Nous\navons vu aussi le vieux bonhomme maréchal Schu-\nlembourg, général des troupes de la république ;\nvous savez qu'elle a presque toujours des étrangers\npour cette place, qui ne vaut pas moins de cent mille\nécus de rente. C'est un bien honnête vieillard, qui\nentend la guerre à merveille et fort mal la morale.\nIl nous fait sur le chapitre des filles de fréquents ser-\nmons, peu écoutés et point du tout suivis; mais il\nfait plus de fruit à table, en nous faisant grande\nchère à l'allemande.

DE QUINTIN.\nSuite du séjour à Venise,\n26 août.\nQuoique je vous aie annoncé par Blancey, mon\ncher Quintin , que je ne vous parlerais point de la\nville, ce serait trop que de n'en rien dire du tout.\nVous pouvez avoir sur son chapitre de fausses idées\nqu'il est de mon devoir de narrateur de ne vous\npoint laisser. Par exemple, vous connaissez de répu-\ntion le palais de Saint-Marc; c'est un vilan monsieur,\ns'il en fut jamais, massif, sombre et gothique, du\nplus méchant goût. La grande cour en dedans ne\nlaisse pas cependant, surtout d'un côté, d'avoir quel-\nque chose de magnifique dans sa construction ; elle\nest assez singulièrement ornée par deux puits, dont\nles margelles prodigieuses, d'un seul jet de bronze,\n\n===== Page 33 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISK. 195\nsont d'un travail aussi fini que considérable, et par\nun superbe escalier tout de marbre blanc et violet,\nqu'on a nommé par anticipation , sachant que j'y\ndevais passer, V escalier des Géants, Il conduit à un\nautre, fort orné de statues et de dorures, qui conduit\nlui-même aux salles où se tiennent les différents con-\nseils. Ces appartements, selon l'ordinaire des vieux\npalais, sont mal distribués, mal tenus et assez som-\nbres; mais si fort enrichis de peintures des plus\ngrands maîtres, qu'il n'a pas fallu moins de huit\njours entiers à notre badauderie pour en voir le\nbout. Le doge est logé dans ce palais; c'est de tous\nles prisonniers de l'État le plus mal glté à mon gré ;\ncar les prisons ordinaires, qui sont près du palais,\nsont un bâtiment tout à fait élégant et agréable. Je\nne veux cependant pas y séjourner trop longtemps,\net je vais au plus vite à Téglise de Saint- Marc.\nVous vous êtes figuré que c'était un lieu admira-\nble ; mais vous vous trompez bien fort ; c'est une\néglise à la grecque, basse, impénétrable à la lumière,\nd'un goût misérable, tant en dedans qu'en dehors,\ncouverte de sept dômes revêtus en dedans de mosaï-\nques à fond d'or, qui les font ressembler bien mieux\nà des chaudières qu'à des coupoles. Elle a double\ncollatérale, dont les deux extérieures ne servent\nguère que de passage ou de promenoirs, et un long\nvestibule destiné au même usage. Avec les richesses\nimmenses qu'on y a prodiguées, il a bien fallu qu'à\n1 Charles de Brosses était d'une très-petite taille. R. G.\n\n===== Page 34 =====\n\n196 XVI.— A M. DE QTTINTIN.\nla fin elle fût curieuse, en dépit des ouvriers diabo-\nliques qui les ont mises en œuvre. Du haut en bas,\nen dedans et en dehors, Tégiise est couverte de pein-\ntures en mosaïque à fond d'or. Vous savez que la\nmosaïque est une peinture qui se fait avec des petites\npièces d'environ trois lignes en carré de pierres na-\nturelles, ou de verre mis en couleur, qui servent à\nnuer et à dessiner le sujet. Ces ouvrages ne peuvent\njamais être bien délicats mais aussi le coloris n'est\npas sujet à se perdre, ce qui a engagé les premiers\npeintres à s'en servir souvent. Maintenant la patience\ninouïe qu'il faut pour cela et le peu de beauté dont\nces ouvrages sont susceptibles en ont fait depuis né-\ngliger la méthode. Celles-ci doivent être regardées\ncomme le premier monument de la peinture, puis-\nqu'elles ont été faites dès l'an 1071, par des ouvriers\ngrecs qu'on fît venir exprès. Ainsi, n'en déplaise aux\nFlorentins, ce n'est point chez eux, c'est ici que cet\nart s'est renouvelé. Leur Cimabue, plus de cent cin-\nquante ans après, vint en prendre l'idée sur les ou-\nvrages de Saint-Marc. C'est en vérité la seule obli-\ngation qu'on ait, tant à lui qu'à ces gens-ci, que\nd'avoir eu le goût assez pervers pour faire les\nméchantes choses qui depuis ont donné lieu à en\nfaire de si belles. Au coloris près, qui s'est assez\nconservé par le genre de l'ouvrage, on ne peut rien\nvoir de si pitoyable que ces mosaïques ; heureuse-\nment les ouvriers ont eu la sage précaution d'écrire\nsur chaque sujet ce qu'ils ont voulu représenter\n1 Dans une mosaïque placée sous le portique, on voit Adam et\n\n===== Page 35 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 197\nLes autres morceaux du méjue genre, que Ton a faits\ndepuis sont mieux exécutés ; il y en a beaucoup qui\nse distinguent par la brillante vivacité du coloris et\ndes fonds d'or; mais en général il n'y a rien là de\nfort satisfaisant, si ce n'est le plafond de la sacristie\noù l'on a eu le bon esprit de représenter, non des\nfigures, mais des broderies et des arabesques de la\ndernière beauté ; c'est le seul genre où la mosaïque\nsoit propre. Le pavé est aussi en entier de mosaïque,\ncomposé de plusieurs mille millions de ces petites\npièces de marbre, jaspes, lapis, agates, serpentine,\ncuivre, etc., sur lequel on ne peut faire un pas sans\nglisser. Le tout a été si bien joint que, quoique le\npavé se soit enfoncé dans certains endroits et fort\nrelevé dans d'autres, aucune petite pièce ne s'est\ndémentie ni n'a sauté; bref, c'est sans contredit le\npremier endroit du monde pour jouer à la toupie.\nBelle comparaison et tout à fait noble ! Une personne\nde goût, telle que vous êtes, ne peut manquer d'en être contente.\nJe ne vous parlerai ni des reliques que Misson a\ntraitées à fond, ni du trésor. Ce n'est pas que je ne\npusse, si je voulais vous en faire une docte et ample\ndescription; mais dans le vrai, je ne l'ai pas vu. Il y\na à cela trop de mystère et trop peu de curiosité.\nJe me suis contenté seulement d'avoir communica-\ntion du fameux Evangile de Saint-Marc, que l'on\nconserve avec le plus grand soin, comme le plus\nÈve coucliés ensemble, et Texliortation latine : Ciescite etmultipli- cate vos, R.

Il est in-4*' en papier\nd'Egypte assez épais, et l'on n'y distingue plus quoi\nque ce soit, que quelques lettres majuscules grecques\npar-ci par-là, qui ne peuvent faire juger si c'est\nplutôt un livre de médecine qu'un Evangile K\nAu-dessus du portail, on a placé quatre chevaux\nde bronze d'une beauté achevée, ouvrage de Lysippe,\nfondeur grec, qui les fit, dit-on, [pour Néron. C'est\nla seule chose, dans tout ce bâtiment, qui soit vrai-\nment digne d'admiration .\nJe montai ensuite à la grande tour qui est près de\nlà, d'où l'on découvre à son aise toute l'étendue de\nVenise les lies et petites villes en mer qui l'accom-\npagnent, les bâtiments qui couvrent les lagunes\ntoute la côte de l'Italie, depuis Comacchio jusqu'à\n1 Au temps de Constantin le Grand et de ses successeurs, le\npapier d'Egypte fut toujours en vogue dans l'empire. C'est en ce siècle- là, ou environ, que fut écrit le fameux livre de TEvangile\nde Saint-Marc, qu'on garde encore aujourd'hui dans le trésor de\nVenise. Je l'ai vu et examiné autant qu'on peut examiner un ma- nuscrit qui est déjà presque tout effacé, et si pourri que les feuilles\nétant toutes collées l'une contre l'autre, on ne péut tenter de tour-\nner un feuillet sans que tout s'en aille en pièces. Ces feuilles de\npapier d'Égypte me semblèrent beaucoup plus délicates que toutes\nles autres que j'ai vues en différents endroits. Sur la forme des\nlettres, il me parut que c'est le plus ancien manuscrit qu'on ait\nencore vu, et qu'on ne se hasarde guère en disant qu'il est pour\nle plus tard du iv siècle. Il y a cent-quarante-six ans qu'on l'a mis dans un caveau souterrain dont la voûte même est plus basse dans\nles marées que la mer voisine. De là vient que l'eau dégoutte per-\npétuellement sur ceux que la curiosité y amène. Cette grande hu-\nmidité a mis le manuscrit en un état qu'on n'y saurait lire deux\nmots de suite. On pouvait encore le lire quand on l'y déposa,\nen 1564 {Note tirée du P.

Le vaisseau en est fort\nbeau et bien orné de peintures ; mais la quantité des\nlivres est au-dessous de ce qu'en ont en France cer-\ntains particuliers. Le cabinet ou salon des manu-\nscrits est plus à remarquer ; la quantité en est fort\nconsidérable; presque tous viennent du cardinal\nBessarion. Ils sont fort bien tenus, d'une bonne con-\nservation et entre les mains d'un bibliothécaire de la\npremière distinction ; c'est le procurateur Tiepolo.\nIl a sous lui Zanetti \\ jeune homme qui ne parait\npas manquer d'érudition , et fort communicatif.\nAinsi;, c'est à tort que le P. Montfaucon s'exhale par-\ntout en plaintes contre le peu d'accès qu'on trouve\ndans les bibliothèques d'Italie ; il devrait plutôt dire\nque les gens de ce pays-ci se défient tellement des\nmoines, qu'ils ne veulent rien montrer aux gens de\ncette robe, quelque mérite qu'ils aient d'ailleurs.\nZanetti fait imprimer maintenant le catalogue et la\nnotice de tous les manuscrits de Saint-Marc. Il me\nmontra un livre qui passe pour le premier imprimé\nen France. Il est intitulé : Guillelmi Ficheti alnetani\n Zanetli (Antoine-Marie), bibliothécaire de Saint-Marc, auteur\nd'un fort bon livre sur les peintures de l'école de Venise.

L'impres-\nsion en est fort belle, sur vélin, avecles lettres prin-\ncipales et les remplissages des alinéa en miniatures\nfaites à la main. Au commencement du livre, contre\nl'usage ordinaire de ce temps-là, et non à la fin,\nest écrit : jEdibus Sorhonœ Parisii scriptum impres-\nsumque anno uno et septuagesimo supra mille-\nsimum.\nLe vestibule de cette bibliothèque est digne de la\nplus grande curiosité, par les statues antiques qu'on\ny a rassemblées : un Ganymède de marbre, accroché\nje ne sais par où (car Taigle qui est dessus ne le tient\npresque point), est suspendu au plafond. Mais tout\ncède à la beauté inimitable de la Léda et de son\ncygne. C'est une fille qui aime l'ordre et l'arrange-\nment; à cet effet, elle a la main passée, je ne sais\ncomme, pour mettre chaque chose à sa place. C'est\nune expression qui ne peut se figurer et au-dessus\nde tout ce que j'ai jamais vu dans les originaux\nvivants, et cependant j'en ai bien vu.\nIl faut que vous preniez votre mal en patience\nsur le Stace ; vous ne l'aurez point, il n'a point été\nimprimé ici, non plus qu'aucun des rares ad usum\nDelphini, Il faut encore vous détacher d'avoir, du\nmoins de très-longtemps, la suite du Musœiim Flo-\nrentinum; mais si vous voulez en récompense le\nMiisœum Venetiarum, qu'on grave à présent, vous\nen êtes le maître. Voilà le prospectus où vous trou-\nverez tout le détail de ce que contient cet ouvrage.\n\n===== Page 39 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 201\nJe l'ai vu; il est fort bien exécuté ; les gravures sont\nbelles et sans hachures, dans le goût de Mellan Au\ncas que vous en soyez curieux, je vous porterai le\npremier tome qui est presque fini; il n'y aura que\ndeux volumes. Ce sont de jeunes tilles qui travaillent\nà cet ouvrage ; il est enrichi de plusieurs pierres\ngravées tirées du fameux cabinet de ïiepolo, qu'il\nfaut que vous voyiez quand vous serez ici, et de\ncelui d'Antonio Zanetti, célèbre brocanteur. N'ou-\nbliez pas non plus de voir en passant le cabinet de\nlivres recherchés de l'Anglais Smith, où il a rassem-\nblé une rare collection d'éditions de 1400.\nNe vous figurez pas que les canaux qui forment\nici les seules rues praticables aient des quais ; pres-\nque tous n'en ont point : la mer bat jusque sur le\nseuil des portes de chaque maison. Dès qu'on en sort,\non a le pied dedans. Cela n'en est peut-être pas\nmieux ; mais cela est plus singulier , et n'est pas plus\nembarrassant pour sortir. Ceux qui n'ont point de\ngondoles à eux trouvent à chaque instant des fiacres\naquatiques dans les carrefours, et comme cette ville\nest toute d'Ilots et de pilotis, chaque maison a aussi\nson issue sur la terre. Les rues sans nombre , sont\nétroites à ne pouvoir passer deux de front sans se\ncoudoyer, toutes pavées de pierres plates ce qui les\nrend glissantes à l'excès à la moindre pluie : elles se\ncommuniquent par cinq cents ponts ou plus.

Les canaux, malgré\nleurs agréments, ont une chose intolérable. Le flux\net reflux sont ici comme dans l'Océan , et quand la\nmer est basse en été , les canaux étroits sont d'une\nhorrible infection. On sait bien qu'il faut que les\nchoses sentent ce qu'elle doivent sentir. Il est permis\naux canaux quels qu'ils soient , de puotter en été ;\nmais pour le coup, c'est abuser de la permission.\nLa ville, en général, n'est pas fort bien bâtie ; ce-\npendant elle a un air de distinction. Plusieurs belles\narchitectures d'églises, comme Saint-Pierre, San-\nGiorgio , San-Francesco , la Sainte , le Redentore ,\nSafi-Salvatore , etc. ; presque toutes du Palladio ou\ndu Sansovino ; sans parler de nombre de palais ma-\ngnifiques sur le Grand Canal, dont les meilleurs sont\nles palais Grimani, Pesaro, Cornaro etLabia; mais\ncomme je vous ai donné parole de ne point parler de\ntableaux, l'architecture ira de compagnie, et je n'en\ndirai plus mot. C'est pourtant ici que sont les chefs-\nd'œuvre sans nombre qu'a produits en peinture l'é-\ncole vénitienne. On a imprimé une notice des ta-\nbleaux publicSj dans laquelle une grande quantité de\nbelles choses se trouvent noyées dans une quantité\ninfiniment plus grande de nlédidcres où de mau-\nvaises. Il me faudrait huit jours de narration pour\nfaire le triage en détail ; voilà ce qui sauve mes au-\nditeurs. Quant à vous, ainsi que je l'ai annoncé, vous\nn'y perdrez rien ; mais ne serait-on pas fâché de ne\nm'entendre rien dire de la Rosalba, cette fameuse\n\n===== Page 41 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VÉNISÈ. 203\npeintre de portraits au pastel, qui a tout surpassé en\nce genre ? J'étais tenté de lui faire faire le mien , si\nje n'avais pensé que ma figure ne valait pas trente\nsequins. En récompense , j'eus la folie de lui offrir\nvingt - cinq louis d'or d'une Madeleine grande\ncomme la main, qu'elle a copiée d'après le Corrége.\nC'était le prix qu'elle l'estimait; et, par bonheur\npour mes vingt-cinq louis , elle ne veut pas s'en dé-\nfaire. Ajoutez encore la remarque suivante à l'article\ndes bâtiments. Dans une très-belle église que l'on\nconstruit actuellement, parmi les jaspes de Sicile\ndont elle est revêtue , on y a mêlé des papiers mar-\nbrés et vernis couverts de talcs, qui font un aussi bon\neffet que le jaspe ; reste à savoir si cela durera long-\ntemps.\nLes palais sont ici d'une magnificence prodiguée\nsans beaucoup de goût. Il n'y a pas moins de deux\ncents pièces d'appartements tout chargés de ri-\nchesses , dans le seul palais Foscarini ; mais tout se\nsurmarche ; il n'y a pas un seul cabinet ni un fau-\nteuil où Von puisse s'asseoir, à cause de la délicatesse\ndes sculptures* Lé palais Labia construit à la mo-\nderne, est le seul qui m'ait paru bien entendu en de-\ndans.

Il est si célèbre, que je fus\nd'abord assez mécontent de trouver les salles des\narmes mal rangées, pleines de vieilleries et de\nrouille , et assez inférieures à d'autres que j'ai vues.\nIl faut néanmoins convenir qu'il est très-remarquable\npar sa vaste étendue et par la quantité de choses\nqu'il contient. Voici les principales qui me soient\nrestées dans l'esprit : des parcs de canôns de fonte et\nde fer, dont quelques-uns sont monstrueux, en\nnombre si étonnant qu'il surpasse celui des fusils et\ndes pistolets ; les tours où on les tourne pour les\nrendre unis en dedans ; la pièce qui fut fondue de-\nvant Henri III, chargée d'ornements et de sculptures\nexcellentes. Un recueil d'ancres de prodigieuses\ngrosseurs; un autre de mâts à l'équivalent.... Des\nsalles et des fabriques de toute espèce.... Trois gros\nrobinets de fontaine qui donnent du vin les ou-\nvriers en vont prendre là tant qu'ils veulent ; ils sont\nau nombre de trois mille , et s'amusent presque tout\nle jour sans travailler ; mais aussi quand il le faut,\nils font merveille jour et nuit ; ils voient quand l'af-\nfaire est pressante , parce qu'alors on double leur\npaye.

Il y a actuellement dix-huit gros bâtiments sur\nces chantiers ; les péottes et gondoles dorées de la\nrépublique ; et enfin le Bucentaure. Celui - ci est à\nmon gré une des belles et des curieuses choses de\nl'univers. C'est une grosse galéasse , ou fort grande\ngalère, toute sculptée et dorée à fond en dehors, du\nmeilleur goût et de la manière la plus finie. Le de-\ndans forme une vastissime salle parquetée, garnie de\nsofas tout autour et d'un trône au bout, pour le doge.\nElle est partagée dans sa longueur par une ligne de\nstatues dorées qui soutiennent le plafond ou pont\nsculpté et doré en plein. Les embrasures des fe-\nnêtres , l'éperon des balcons de la poupe, les bancs\ndes rameurs et le gouvernail sont du même goût, et\ntoute la machine a pour toit une tente de velours,\ncouleur de feu, brodée d'or.\nLe petit arsenal du palais Saint-Marc est plus\nagréable et mieux rangé que le grand ; il commu-\nnique à la salle du Grand Conseil , et les armes sont\ntoujours chargées, pour être toutes prêtes à la dé-\nfense en cas d'émeute populaire ; car avouez que,\nlorsque le corps des nobles est assemblé, une conju-\nration ou une sédition aurait beau jeu pour s'en dé-\nfaire d'un coup de filet ; aussi y a-t-il toujours alors\nà la tour Saint-Marc des procurateurs qui, sous d'au-\ntres prétextes, ont l'œil alerte, tandis que l'assem-\nblée se tient.

On y conserve quantité\nd'armures de grands capitaines ; celle de Henri IV,\ndont il fit présent à la république, est comme de rai-\nson dans le lieu le plus honorable. J'ai remarqué un\ncoup de fusil dans cette armure. C'est aussi là qu'est\nun cadenas célèbre, dont jadis un certain tyran de\nPadoue, inventeur de cette machine odieuse, se ser-\nvait pour mettre en sûreté l'honneur de sa femme. Il\nfallait que cette femme eût 'bien de l'honneur, car la\nserrure est diablement large.\nL'inquisition existe à Venise ; mais elle a les on-\ngles tellement rognés, que c'est à peu près comme\nsil n'y en avait point. Les ministres de ce tribunal\nne peuvent rien conclure qu'en présence de trois\npersonnes du gouvernement, préposées à cet effet.\nDès qu'on avance une proposition tant soit peu forte,\nune des trois se lève et sort ; dès lors l'assemblée ne\npeut plus rien faire. Les gens d'Eglise n'ont pas beau\njeu ici pour cabaler : dès qu'un homme a quelque\nbénéfice, quelque brevet de Rome ou simplement\nle petit collet, il est exclu ipso facto de toute part au\ngouvernement, et sensé démis de sa charge s'il en a\nune. Toute personne qui a ou qui a eu charge de mi-\nnistre de la république à Rome ne peut jamais être\nfait cardinal ni obtenir aucune prélature.

DE QUINTIN.\nObservations sur quelques tableaux de Venise.\nA Fondaco dei Tedeschi, l'extérieur du bâtiment\net une partie de l'intérieur peints à fresque, par le\nGiorgione, peintures presque entièrement effacées ;\nperte très-déplorable ; ce devait être le plus bel et le\nplus grand ouvrage du Giorgione, peintre d'autant\nplus aimable par son coloris, qu'il n'a point eu de\nmodèle dans cette belle partie de la peinture dont il\nest, à vraidirC;, l'inventeur. Le coloris du Giorgione\nest d'une entente et d'une lierté étonnantes ; mais il\ny a quelque chose de brusque et de sauvage. Je le\ncomparerais volontiers, pour le coloris, à ce qu'est\nMichel- Ange pour le dessin. Avant lui, on dessinait\ndes figures gothiques que Ton coloriait avec soin et\navec éclat, d'une manière sèche et sans fin. Ces deux\nmaîtres sont les czars Pierre de la peinture, qui en\nont banni la barbarie ; mais ce n'a pas été sans féro-\ncité. Au dedans, quantité d'assez bonnes peintures,\nsurtout les Bains de Diane et le Jugement de Paris.\nA Saint-Roch, la Piscine probatique, merveilleux\nouvrage du Tintoret. C'est là qu'il a montré qu'il\nsavait parfaitement, lorsqu'il voulait s'en donner la\npeine, ordonner sans furie, dessiner sans rudesse et\n\n===== Page 46 =====\n\n208 XVir.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\ncolorier sans noirceur. Je serais fort enclin à juger\nque le Tintoret est le premier de tous les peintres\nvénitiens, lorsqu'il veut bien faire, ce qui lui arrive\ntrès-rarement. — Saint-Martin faisant l'aumône,\nbonne fresque du Pordenone.\nLe Tintoret a peint à l'école Saint-Roch une partie\nde la vie de Jésus-Christ, dans une quantité de grands\ntableaux. La vie d'un autre peintre n'aurait pas suffi\nà faire tout ce qu'il a exécuté ici, et presque toujours\nfort bien. C'est là que tout peintre trouvera une école\ninépuisable de dessins et de clairs-obscurs : l'An-\nnonciation, la Fuite en Egypte, la Cène, et surtout\nla figure de Jésus-Christ, vêtu de blanc devant Pi-\nlate, et le grand tableau du Crucifiement, chef-\nd'œuvre du Tintoret, dont Augustin Carrache a\ngravé une si belle estampe, m'ont paru admirables.\nQuel dommage que ce peintre, avec tant de talent,\nn'ait point du tout connu les grâces qui peuvent seu-\nles leur donner du prix !\nUne chapelle est remplie de belles choses, mal\nplacées dans ce lieu obscur, où on les voit à peine.\nIl faut considérer le mieux que l'on pourra le ta-\nbleau du Baptême de Jésus-Christ, et le beau pla-\nfond représentant l'Adoration des Mages ; la Recon-\nnaissance de saint Nicolas, les Stigmates de saint\nFrançois, et les quatre Évangélistes, par le Véronèse ;\nla Vierge avec saint André, et la Prédication de\nsaint Jean-Baptiste, par le Fiammingo, et surtout\n1 Denis Calvart. R. C.\n\n===== Page 47 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLEAUX DE VENISE. 209\nla Vierge avec saint Sébastien, saint Nicolas, etc.,\npar le Titien. Cet excellent tableau est fort noirci\npar le peu de soin qu'on en a eu, et par la mauvaise\ndisposition du lieu. La figure de saint Sébastien est\ntrès-délicate, très-agréable, mais peut-être aussi\ntrop ronde et trop efféminée.\nOn pourrait appeler Saint-Sébastien l'école de\nPaul Véronèse. On y voit la gradation de son génie,\nde ses divers ouvrages et de toutes ses manières. Le\nplafond de la sacristie, représentant le Couronne-\nment de la Vierge , par où il a commencé , est fort\ninférieur à ce qu'il a fait depuis. Les plus belles\npeintures qu'il ait faites ici sont le plafond de l'église,\nreprésentant l'histoire d'Esther ; les portes de l'orgue\nreprésentant au dehors la Purification et la Guérison\ndu Paralytique ; le tableau représentant saint Sébas-\ntien devant le tyran, celui de saint Sébastien Hé à\nun tronc d'arbre; le grand Festin de Jésus-Christ\nchez Simon le lépreux , peint dans le réfectoire ; et\nsurtout le Martyre de saint Marc et de saint Marcel-\nlian, ouvrage très-bien composé, où tout se rapporte\nau sujet; chose rare dans les ordonnances de Paul,\nqui n'a pas mieux connu l'unité d'action que le cos-\ntume. Quant aux quatre grands Festins de cet auteur,\nle premier de tous, sans contredit, est celui des\nNoces de Cana, peint dans le réfectoire de Saint-\nGeorges ; puis celui chez le pharisien , qui était ci-\ndevant aux Servîtes, et qui est à présent à Versailles\ndans le grand salon d'Hercule ; puis celui chez le\nlévite, peint à l'éghse des Saints-Jean-et-Paul ; mais\n\n===== Page 48 =====\n\n210 XVII.— A M. DE QUINTIN.\nces deux peuvent aller en concurrence, et enfin celui\nque l'on voit ici à Saint-Sébastien, qui est le moindre\ndes quatre. Paul s'est beaucoup copié lui-même dans\ntous ses ouvrages, mais surtout dans ses quatre\nFestins.\nA l'école de la Charité, la Vierge Marie montant\nles degrés du temple, par le Titien, tableau de la\npremière classe; avec le saint Pierre, martyr, ils\npassent pour les deux plus beaux du Titien : celui-ci\nest fort distingué pour ses airs de tête et son admi-\nrable coloris. Il m'a fait plus de plaisir que le Saint-\nPierre, martyr; et le Saint-Laurent des Jésuites m'en\na plus fait que l'un et l'autre. Cependant celui-ci ,\nqui est de la seconde manière du Titien , l'emporte\nde beaucoup par le coloris sur le Saint-Laurent, qui\nn'est que de sa troisième manière ; alors son coloris\nest devenu trop vague et négligé.\nEnfin à San-Giorgio, dans le fond du réfectoire,\nles Noces de Cana de Paul Véronèse, tableau non-\nseulement de la première classe, mais des premiers\nde cette classe. On peut le mettre en comparaison\navec la Bataille de Constantin contre le tyran\nMaxence , peinte au Yatican , par Raphaël et par\nJules Romain, soit pour la grandeur de la composi-\ntion , soit pour le nombre infini des figures, soit pour\nl'extrême beauté de l'exécution. Il y a bien plus de\nfeu , plus de dessin , plus de science, plus de fidélité\nde costume dans la bataille de Constantin ; mais dans\ncelui-ci , quelle richesse ! quel coloris ! quelle har-\nmonie dans les couleurs! quelle vérité dans les\n\n===== Page 49 =====\n\nSUR QUELQUES TABLËAUX DE VENISE. 211\nétoffes ! quelle ordonnance et quelle machine éton-\nnante dans toute la composition ! L'un de ces ta-\nbleaux est une action vive, et l'autre est un spectacle.\nIl semble dans celui-ci qu'on aille passer tout au\ntravers des portiques, et que la foule des ns qui y\nsont assemblés vous fassent compagnie. L'architec-\nture, qui est une des belles parties du tableau, a été\nfaite par Benedetto Caliari , frère de Paul : il excel-\nlait dans ce genre. Paul a représenté au naturel les\nplus fameux peintres vénitiens exécutant un concert.\nAu-devant du tableau, dans le vide de l'intérieur du\ntriclinium, le Titien joue de la basse ; Paul joue de\nla viole; le Tintoret du violon, et le Bassan de la\nflûte, par où il a voulu faire allusion à la profonde\nscience et à l'exécution lente et sage du Titien , aux\nbrillants et aux agréments de Paul , à la rapidité du\nTintoret, et à la suavité du Bassan. Remarquez l'at-\ntention que donne Paul à un homme qui vient lui\nparler, et la suspension de son archet. Une grande\nfigure debout tenant une coupe à la main, vêtue\nd'une étoffe à l'orientale blanche et verte, est celle\nde Benedetto, son frère.\nCe n'est pas sans plaisir que j'ai trouvé, à Casa\nPisani, l'admirable Famille de Darius de ce même\nPaul Véronèse, tableau dont j'ai l'esquisse faite de\nsa main, pour l'exécution de son grand ouvrage. Il y\na deux ou trois tètes finies par le maître ; le reste en\npartie achevé par ses élèves, en partie resté en ébau-\nche. On y voit aussi Loth enivré par ses filles du\ncavalier Liberi. Ce peintre travaillait d'une assez\n\n===== Page 50 =====\n\n212 XVIII.— A M. DE BLAN€EY.\ngrande manière et avait beaucoup étudié Michel-\nAnge. Il réussit assez bien dans la composition\ndes tableaux d'histoire, et aimait entre autres à\npeindre des nudités et des sujets libres. Ses figu-\nres sont grosses, ses chairs rouges et fort san-\nguines.\nXVIII. — A M. DE BLANCEY,\nSuite du séjour à Venise.\n29 août.\nCe que j'avais prévu est arrivé, mon gros Blan-\ncey ; votre première lettre vient de m'ètre renvoyée\nde Rome; elle n'est pas de fraîche date, quoique\nfort moderne en comparaison d'une autre que je\nreçois de Londres , laquelle a été renvoyée de Rome\nà la grande poste de Paris, d'où elle est revenue à\nRome, puis ici. Elle vient d'arriver tout essoufflée\nd'une si longue traite. Il me semble, mon petit ami,\nque vous vous donnez assez joUment les violons ; la\nmodestie vous siérait cependant mieux qu'à per-\nsonne. C'est moi qui pourrais en manquer, tandis\nque je mets à Venise la nation française sur un si\ngrand pied que tout franc, je crains qu'un autre ne\npuisse s'y soutenir. Pour vous, on sait assez que vous\nn'êtes l'alné que secwidum quid. Cependant il y au- rait de la dureté à vouloir vous ôter la satisfaction\nde vous louer vous-même sur l'article, puisque vous\n\n===== Page 51 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 213\nne Têtes là -dessus par personne autre. Témoignez,\nje vous prie à ces dames, combien je suis sensible\nà l'empressement qu'elles veulent bien avoir pour\nmes nouvelles. Je me souviens tous les jours d'elles\net avec plaisir. Dans cette commémoration, ma\nbonne amie de Montot tient le premier rang. Ce\nserait bien en vain que l'on courrait le monde pour\ntrouver ailleurs un cœur aussi sensible et aussi vrai,\nune âme plus pure et meilleure, un caractère aussi\négal, aussi sociable, aussi doux; en vérité, je pense\nd'elle ce que l'on a dit d'un homme célèbre qiiil\nfaisait honneur à Ihumanité, Qu'a-t-elle besoin\nd'être d'une aussi jolie figure ? Elle devrait la laisser\nà quelque autre ; elle n'en a que faire pour être uni-\nversellement chérie de tout le monde. Je lui passe\ncependant ses yeux si doux et si fins, parce qu'ils\nsont le plus beau miroir de la plus belle âme qui ait\njamais été. Je suis vraiment affligé qu'elle ait perdu\nson dernier enfant; mais je m'en console, en pensant\nque c'est une perte que l'on peut réparer en deux\nminutes. Au surplus, assurez-les toutes bien fort\nque je persiste opiniâtrément dans la bonne religion,\net que je n'ai point encore, au milieu des infidèles,\nquitté les sentiments orthodoxes, mais je ne réponds\npas de ce que la peur du martyre peut me faire faire\nà Florence. Continuez-moi exactement votre chro-\nnique. S'il n'y a point d'histoire, parbleu ! vous\nvoilà bien en peine, faites-en; moi qui vous parle,\nme mets- je en peine de mentir pour vous amu-\nser?\n\n===== Page 52 =====\n\n214 XVIII.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\nJe quitte Dijon, non sans regrets, pour revenir à\nVenise.\nJe voudrais bien pouvoir vous parler savamment\ndu carnaval. On nous presse fort ici d'y revenir pas-\nser ce temps, et l'on nous promet de nous faire voir\nune tout autre Venise ; mais je n'imagine pas que\nnous lui donnions la préférence sur nos affaires et sur\nnos amis. Ce carnaval commence dès le 5 octobre, et\nil y en a un autre petit de quinze jours à l'Ascension ;\nde sorte que l'on peut compter ici environ six mois,\noù qui que ce soit ne va autrement qu'en masque,\nprêtres ou autres, même le nonce et le gardien des\ncapucins. Ne pensez pas que je raille, c'est l'habit\nd'ordonnance ; et les curés seraient, dit-on, mécon-\nnus de leurs paroissiens, l'archevêque de son clergé,\ns'ils n'avaient le masque à la main ou sur le nez. Je\nregrette cette singularité, et encore plus les opéras\net les spectacles du temps. Ce n'est pas que je man-\nque de musique ; il n'y a presque point de soirée\nqu'il n'y ait académie quelque part ; le peuple court\nsur le Canal l'entendre avec autant d'ardeur que si\nc'était pour la première fois. L'affolement de la na-\ntion pour cet art est inconcevable. Vivaldi s'est fait\nde mes amis intimes, pour me vendre des concertos\nbien cher. Il y a en partie réussi, et moi, à ce que je\ndésirais, qui était de l'entendre et d'avoir souvent de\nbonnes récréations musicales : c'est un vecchio qui\na une furie de composition prodigieuse. Je l'ai ouï\nse faire fort de composer un concerto, avec toutes ses\nparties, plus promptement qu'un copiste ne le pourrait\n\n===== Page 53 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 215\ncopier. J'ai trouvé, à mon grand étonnement, qu'il\nn'est pas aussi estimé qu'il le mérite en ce pays-ci,\noù tout est de mode, où l'on entend ses ouvrages de-\npuis trop longtemps, et où la musique de l'année\nprécédente n'est plus de recette. Le fameux Saxon\nest aujourd'hui l'homme fété. Je l'ai ouï chez lui\naussi bien que la célèbre Faustina Bordoni, sa femme,\nqui chante d'un grand goût et d'une légèreté char-\nmante ; mais ce n'est plus une voix neuve. C'est sans\ncontredit la plus complaisante et la meilleure femme\ndu monde, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure chanteuse.\nLa musique transcendante ici est celle des hôpi-\ntaux. Il y en a quatre, tous composés de filles bâtar-\ndes ou orphelines, et de celles que leurs parents ne\nsont pas en état d'élever. Elles sont élevées aux dé-\npens de l'Etat, et on les exerce uniquement à exceller\ndans la musique. Aussi chantent-elles comme des\nanges, et jouent du violon, de la flûte, de l'orgue, du\nhautbois, du violoncelle, du basson ; bref, il n'y a\nsi gros instrument qui puisse leur faire peur. Elles\nsont cloîtrées en façon de religieuses. Ce sont elles\nseules qui exécutent, et chaque concert est composé\nd'une quarantaine de filles. Je vous jure qu'il n'y a\nrien de si plaisant que de voir une jeune et jolie re-\nligieuse, en habit blanc, avec un bouquet de grenades\nsur l'oreille, conduire l'orchestre et battre la mesure\navec toute la grâce et la précision imaginables. Leurs\nvoix sont adorables pour la tournure et la légèreté ;\n* Hasse (Jean-Adolphe) , un des plus célèbres compositeur\ndu xviu' siècle; mort à Venise en 1783. R. C,\n\n===== Page 54 =====\n\n216 XVIII.—A M. DE BLANCEY.\ncar on ne sait ici ce que c'*est que rondeur et sons filés\nà la française. La Zabetta des Incurables est surtout\nétonnante par l'étendue de sa voix et les coups d'ar-\nchet qu'elle a dans le gosier. Pour moi, je ne fais\naucun doute qu'elle n'ait avalé le violon de Somis.\nC'est elle qui enlève tous les suffrages, et ce serait\nvouloir se faire assommer par la populace que d'éga-\nler quelque autre à elle. Mais, écoutez, mes amis, je\ncrois que personne ne nous entend, et je vous dis à\nl'oreille que la Margarita des Mendicanti la vaut\nbien, et me plait davantage.\nCelui des quatre hôpitaux où je vais le plus sou-\nvent, et où je m'amuse le mieux, c'est l'hôpital de la\nPiété ; c'est aussi le premier pour la perfection des\nsymphonies. Quelle roideur d'exécution ! C'est là\nseulement qu'on entend ce premier coup d'archet, si\nfaussement vanté à l'Opéra de Paris. La Chiarretta\nserait sûrement le premier violon de l'Italie , si\nl'Anna-Maria des Hospitalettes ne la surpassait en-\ncore. J'ai été assez heureux pour entendre cette der-\nnière, qui est si fantasque qu'à peine joue-t-elle une\nfois en un an. Ils ont ici une espèce de musique que\nnous ne connaissons point en France , et qui me pa-\nrait plus propre que nulle autre pour le jardin de\nBourbonne. Ce sont de grands concertos où il n'y a\npoint de violino principale. Quintin peut demander\nà Bourbonne s'il veut que je lui en apporte une pro-\nvision. Pendant que j'y songe, que Quintin me rende\naussi raison pour vous des livres dont Machefoire\npeut m'avoir fait l'acquisition. Je viens d'en envoyer\n\n===== Page 55 =====\n\nSEJOUR A VENISE. 217\nen France un gros ballot, tous d'édition de 1400,\naccompagnés de force marasquin de Zara, Barbades,\ndes Indes et de Corfou, et thériaque de Venise. Groi-\nriez-vous bien que l'espèce de fonction qui se fit en\ndernier lieu le jour de Saint-Barthélemi, et que l'on\nappelle le théâtre de la thériaque, est une chose tout\nà fait amusante ? Toutes les drogues qui entrent dans\ncette composition y sont non-sealement étalées en\nguise de dessert monté , mais encore arrangées avec\nautant d'adresse que de patience ; ce sont des ca-\nmaïeux, des broderies , des paysages et surtout des\nsuites de médailles d'empereurs romains admirables.\nLes vipères y forment des guirlandes et des festons,\net Ton a trouvé le secret de leur donner un air ga-\nlant. Le talent de la nation italienne pour les orne-\nments est exquis; avec une douzaine de nappes\nblanches et autant de mannequins, ils ont façonné en\nun instant autant de statues dignes de Phidias. On\npose cela sur une architecture des trois ordres , de\nmême fabrique ; en vingt-quatre heures , voilà une\néglise parée à ravir pour le jour de sa fête. Je n'ai\npas vu les combats des gondoliers sur les ponts , on\nles a abolis à mon grand regret. En récompense, ils\nont inventé un autre jeu appelé les forces d Hercule,\nUne certaine quantité d'hommes tout nus, se rangent\ndans le Canal en nombre égal, vis-à-vis les uns des\nautres, sur deux lignes ; de petites planches étroites\nportent des deux bouts sur les épaules; d'autres\nhommes montent debout sur ces planches ; un autre\nrang d'hommes sur ceux-ci par la même méthode, I. 13\n\n===== Page 56 =====\n\n218 XVIII.— A M. DE BLANCEY.\net ainsi par gradation jusqu'à ce qu'il n'y ait qu'un\nhomme , sur la tète duquel monte un enfant. Tout\ncela ne parvient pas à bien sans que les planches ne\ncassent souvent, et que la pyramide ou château de\ncartes ne soit dérangée par les fréquentes cascades\ndans Teau. Ce petit jeu, à se rompre le cou, se pra-\ntique quelquefois près du pont de Rialto. Je ne sais\npourquoi on s'extasie si fort en parlant de ce pont ;\non pourrait se contenter de dire qu'il est assez beau.\nIl est vrai qu'il n'y a qu'une arcade ; mais le lieu n'en\nexige pas davantage, et elle n'est pas plus large\nqu'une de celles du pont Saint-Esprit. Il est vrai\naussi qu'il est tout de marbre blanc et fort large ; car\nil y a dessus trois rues et quatre rangs de boutiques,\nà la vérité épaisses comme des lames de couteaux, et\nles rues à l'avenant. Tout cela ne fait pas un tiers en\nsus de la largeur du Pont-Neuf.\nJ'avais annoncé, ce me semble, que je ne dirais\nplus rien de Venise. Voilà cependant un long cha-\npitre ; mais en vérité cela doit s'appeler n'en rien\ndire, tant j'omets de choses considérables sur ce\nsujet singulier. Nous y avons été retenus plus long-\ntemps que nous ne croyions, tant par les lignes que\nTon a faites contre les justes soupçons de peste à la\nfoire de Sinigaglia, que par notre fainéantise, et\nles instances de notre ambassadeur, qui nous a\npriés d'assister à la visite de cérémonie que lui a\nrendue M.

Peut-elle être faite\npar des gens qui connaissent Textrême régularité de\nmes mœurs? Je ne crois pas que les fées ni les anges\nensemble puissent, de leurs dix doigts, former deux\naussi belles créatures que la Zulietta et l'Ancilla.\nLacurne est très-féru de la première et moi de la\nseconde, depuis que je l'ai vue un jour déguisée en\nVénus de Médicis, et aussi parfaite de tout point.\nElle passe avec raison pour la plus belle femme de\nl'Italie. Notre ambassadeur me parait avoir grande\nenvie d'être l'ami de la première, et celui de Naples\nde l'être bien fort de la seconde.\nCe n'est qu ici au monde que l'on peut voir ce que\nj'ai vu; un homme, ministre et prêtre, dans un spec-\ntacle public, en présence de quatre mille personnes,\nbadiner d'une fenêtre à l'autre avec la plus fameuse\n\n===== Page 58 =====\n\n2-iO XVIII.— A M.

Savez-vous bien que je trouvai un\njour à cette princesse un poignard dans sa poche?\nElle prétendit que dans sa profession, on était en\ndroit de le porter pour la manutention de la police\ndans la maison. J'en suis moins surpris depuis que\nje sais que les religieuses en portent, et que j'ai\nappris qu'une abbesse, aujourd'hui vivante, s'était\njadis battue à coups de poignard contre une autre\ndame, pour l'abbé de Pomponne. L'aventure ne\nlaissa pas de faire quelque éclat, car elle ne s'était\npas passée dans le couvent,\nKAgatinaest la plus splendide de toutes les cour-\ntisanes de Venise. Elle est logée dans un petit palais,\nmeublé superbement, et parée de bijoux comme une\nnymphe. A la vérité, c'est la moins jolie de toutes\ncelles du premier ordre ; mais, d'un autre côté, qui\npeut nier que les faveurs d'une main couverte de\ndiamants ne soient véritablement précieuses ?\nJe reviens en ce moment de Murano, où j'ai été\nvoir travailler à la manufacture de glaces* Elles ne\nsont pas aussi grandes ni aussi blanches que les\nnôtres ; mais elles sont plus transparentes et moins\nsujettes à avoir des défauts* On ne les coule pas sur\ndes tables de cuivre comme les nôtres ; on les souffle\ncomme des bouteilles. Il faut des ouvriers extrême-\nment grands et robustes pour travailler à cet ouvrage,\nsurtout pour balancer en l'air ces gros globes de\ncristal qui tiennent à la longue verge de fer qui\nsert à les souffler.\n\n===== Page 59 =====\n\nSÉJOUR A VENISE. 22l\nL'ouvrier prend, dans le creuset du fourneau, une\ngrosse quantité de matière fondue au bout de sa\nverge creuse : cette matière est afors gluante et en\nconsistance dégomme. L'ouvrier, en soufflant, en\nfait un globe creux; puis , à force de le balancer en\nl'air et de le présenter à tout moment à la bouche du\nfourneau , afin d'y entretenir un certain degré de\nfusion, toujours en le tournant fort vite, pour empê-\ncher que la matière présentée au feu ne coule plus\nd'un côté que d'un autre , il parvient à en faire un\nlong ovale. Alors un autre ouvrier, avec la pointe\nd'une paire de ciseaux, faits comme des forces à\ntondre les moutons, c'est-à-dire qui s'élargissent en\nrelâchant la main , perce l'ovale par son extrémité.\nLe premier ouvrier, qui tient la verge à laquelle est\nattaché ce globe , le tourne fort vite tandis que le\nsecond lâche peu à peu la main qui tient les ciseaux.\nDe cette manière l'ovale s'ouvre en entier par l'un\ndes bouts, comme un marli de verre. Alors on le dé-\ntache de la première verge de fer , et on le scelle de\nnouveau, par le bout ouvert, à une autre verge faite\nexprès ; puis on l'ouvre par l'autre bout avec le\nmême mécanisme que celui décrit ci-dessus. Tl en\nrésulte un long cylindre de glace d'un large dia-\nmètre, qu'on représente, en le tournant, à la bouche\ndu fourneau pour Tamollir un peu de nouveau ; et ,\nau sortir de là, tout en un clin d'œil, d'un seul coup\nde ciseau, l'on coupe la glace en long , et prompte-\nment on l'étend tout à plat sur une table de cuivre.\nIl ne faut plus après que la recuire davantage dans\n\n===== Page 60 =====\n\n222 XIX. —A M.

It comes from Charles de Brosses's \"Lettres familières d'Italie\". Please bridge the gaps between the events that de Brosses describes in a plausible way.\nOn nous fit la faveur de nous faire entrer au Grand Conseil pour voir l'élection du général des galères, charge assez importante. Le Grand Conseil se tient dans une salle immense et bien ornée. Dans le fond est une estrade où sont les places des conseillers et des inquisiteurs d'État, avec le trône du doge au milieu. L'estrade surbaissée tourne tout autour de la salle, et de longs rangs de bancs adossés les uns aux autres et rangés en allées remplissent la salle. Tous les nobles entrèrent là sans ordre et se placèrent. Les robes rouges avoient leurs places marquées, et quelques-unes se dispersèrent en différents lieux de la salle, pour empêcher qu'il ne se fît du bruit dans une si nombreuse assemblée; chose, à mon gré, où ils ne réussirent nullement, puisque l'on y faisoit un sabbat de l'autre monde; aussi ne faisoit-on là que peloter en attendant partie.\n\nPrès du grand chancelier, sur l'estrade, il y avoit une urne contenant autant de petites boules qu'il y avoit de personnes, et parmi ces boules un certain nombre de dorées ; chacun tira la sienne. Ceux à qui échurent celles dorées furent les électeurs de la charge en question, avec une grande quantité d'autres qui, par leurs places, étoient électeurs de droit.\n\nCela fait, nous passâmes dans la salle du scrutin, ornée de la même manière que la première, moins grande, remplie de bancs, l'assemblée y étant moins nombreuse. Les autres électeurs entrèrent l'un après l'autre, saluant jusqu'à terre les précédents, avec une gravité sans pareille. Dès qu'ils eurent tous défilé, le chancelier parut, précédé du corps des secrétaires, gens subalternes, et précédant lui-même le vice-doge; car le doge étoit malade, et c'est le plus vieux des conseillers qui le représente. Mais il ne s'assied pas sur le trône et n'a pas le corno; il l'imitoit tant qu'il pouvoit, ayant mis sur sa tête sa barrette ou bonnet de taffetas noir, dont il ramenoit le sommet par devant en bec à la phrygienne, comme un véritable Anténor. Il étoit suivi de tous les conseillers en robes rouges. Dès qu'il parut, toute l'assemblée se leva; il la salua profondément, sans ôter sa barrette que pour la Quarantie criminelle, lorsqu'il passa devant elle. Seul, de toute l'assemblée, il l'avoit sur la tête.\n\nIl monta sur l'estrade et s'assit. Les sages, grands et autres, se placèrent autour de lui, et sur les ailes le chancelier, à la tête des secrétaires, dont il est le chef. Cette assemblée avoit l'air tout à fait majestueux.\n\nAlors le chancelier se leva et dit que les seigneurs Priuli, Badoar, Donato et Vendramini demandoient la charge en question. Sur-le-champ leurs parents proches se levèrent et sortirent. Immédiatement après, les trois avvogadori prirent chacun un petit évangile, et parcoururent les rangs en faisant toucher à chacun cet évangile du bout du doigt, marque du serment de procéder à l'élection de bonne foi et sans brigue.\n\nTous ces préalables finis, un grand marsouin d'huissier, ayant mis une paire de lunettes monstrueuses sur un nez qui l'étoit davantage, proclama d'un ton nasillard : « Vexcellentissimo signore Luca Priuli. » À l'instant, une vingtaine de petits enfants rouges, comme ceux de l'hôpital, se dispersèrent par la salle, criant comme des perdus : « Priuli ! Priuli ! » Ils avoient chacun à la main une boîte à deux compartiments, l'un blanc pour nommer, l'autre vert pour refuser; l'ouverture commune étant faite en entonnoir, afin que les assistants ne puissent voir dans laquelle des deux divisions on met la main, et à la ceinture une gibecière pleine de petites ballottes comme des boutons de chemisette; ils en donnèrent une à chaque noble. Ceux-ci la mirent dans celle des enchâtres (compartiments) qu'ils voulurent. Les enfants portèrent leurs boîtes au chancelier, qui versa les ballottes des enchâtres blanches dans un bassin, et jeta les autres. On ballotta de même les trois autres concurrents; puis on compta les suffrages. Donato fut élu, et nous sortîmes.\n\nTout cela fut fait avec une rapidité surprenante, et en moins de temps qu'il n'y en a que je vous en écris; mais c'étoit une vraie comédie que de voir, en sortant, les prosternations de Donato et les baisers de nourrice qu'on lui donnoit. D'honneur, ils sonnoient à se faire entendre au milieu de la place.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 page story in english that enhances the event contained in:[EVENT_De_Brosses], keep everything already present and build around it.

      "content": "October 3rd.\n\nThe morning mist, clinging low over the water, had barely begun to lift as I set out, the air still carrying the damp chill of the Venetian night. I had risen early, eager to continue my explorations, particularly to see Il Redentore on the Giudecca. My gondolier, a quiet fellow named Marco, whose face was weathered by sun and salt, deftly navigated the narrow canals, his oar dipping with a rhythmic hush that was the city’s true heartbeat. We passed under low bridges, the stone cool and damp above us, and by the darkened ground floors of palaces where the faint sounds of waking life – a clatter of pottery, a murmured greeting – were just beginning. As we emerged into the broader stretch of the Giudecca Canal, the church of Il Redentore appeared across the water, its grand, serene façade slowly emerging from the receding mist, catching the first pale rays of the rising sun.\n\nIt stood there, a vision of Palladian genius, its lines severe yet harmonious, a testament to the architect’s profound understanding of classical forms. I had read of it, seen engravings, but to stand before it, even from a distance across the water, was to feel its presence. Marco brought the gondola alongside the quay, and I stepped out, my gaze fixed on the church. The façade, indeed, surpassed even that of San Giorgio Maggiore in its balance and clarity. Palladio, I mused, was a man truly steeped in the antique spirit, yet forced to build for an age that had lost much of that grandeur. He wrestled with the conventions of his time, striving to infuse Christian sacred spaces with the noble simplicity of ancient temples. In Il Redentore, he seemed to have achieved a rare success, avoiding the subtle incongruities I had noted in San Giorgio. It was a triumph of will and vision, a master’s refusal to yield to the \"narrow, petty spirit\" of his contemporaries.\n\nInside, the admiration only deepened. The vast, uncluttered space, the elegant proportions, the light filtering through high windows – it all spoke of Palladio’s hand. Even the altars, often left to lesser artists, bore his distinctive touch, each a miniature architectural composition. Yet, a shadow of disappointment fell as my eyes sought the niches intended for statuary. Instead of the marble or bronze figures that would have completed Palladio’s vision, I found crude wooden carvings, flat and painted, glaringly out of place. They were simple, almost rustic, betraying a lack of means or perhaps a shift in artistic priorities. It was a common enough sight in churches, but here, in a structure of such refined beauty, it felt like a betrayal of the grand design. One could almost hear Palladio sighing from the grave at such a compromise.\n\nLeaving Il Redentore, I wandered through the labyrinthine streets, my mind still turning over Palladio’s legacy. My path led me, almost by chance, to the church of San Pietro di Castello, a place less frequented by the casual visitor. The Capuchin friars, known for their austerity, had nonetheless lavished considerable attention on a side altar dedicated to Saint Francis. It was a curious sight, a blend of humble devotion and unexpected artistry. Only the Corinthian capitals, flanking the altar, were of stone. All else, at first glance, appeared to be covered in a rich, almost opulent embroidery, styled in the intricate arabesque patterns so favored in the East, but rendered with a distinctly Venetian flourish.\n\nI approached, drawn by the shimmering details. The broad tendrils and foliage seemed to glow with gold, woven with a skill that suggested immense labor and precious materials. My initial thought was of the wealth such an adornment must have required, perhaps donated by some pious noble family. But as I drew nearer, my eyes, accustomed now to the subtle deceptions of art and craft, discerned an ingenious trick. What I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw, flattened and meticulously glued onto paper, following intricate outlines. The background, beneath these straw patterns, was painted in vibrant, lively colors, creating an illusion of depth and richness. The effect was remarkably pretty, a testament to the Capuchins' resourcefulness and artistic sensibility. To achieve such variety and tact with a material so utterly without intrinsic value, yet to create a design that, if executed in genuine gold thread, would have cost thousands of ducats – it was a marvel of imitation. I considered its potential, thinking how such a technique might be advantageously applied elsewhere, a lesson in making much from little.\n\nLater that afternoon, as I strolled along one of the bustling quays, perhaps near the Riva del Carbon, where the Grand Canal narrowed, I often found myself observing a particular spectacle. A small man, with an unassuming, almost sedate appearance, held court before a shifting crowd of auditors. He was a storyteller, a \"cantastorie,\" his voice a rapid-fire torrent of Venetian dialect. Though I understood scarcely a word, his performance was captivating. The audience, composed mostly of porters, fishermen, and market vendors – the lowest class, as I noted – would occasionally smile, a flicker of appreciation crossing their faces, but never erupt into laughter. It was a serious business, this storytelling. The man’s gestures were what truly held my attention: an admirable variety, precise and economical, each movement of his hands, each tilt of his head, conveying meaning that transcended the barrier of language. It was a performance born of art and reflection, honed over countless repetitions, a silent language understood by all. He was not ridiculous, not striking in a flamboyant way, but possessed a quiet authority, an almost scholarly precision in his delivery, that commanded respect even from those who merely passed by.\n\nMy next destination was the Conservatorio dei Mendicanti, a renowned institution. With my map, a precious possession in this city of bewildering twists and turns, I plunged into the \"strangest labyrinth\" of narrow calli and sudden campi. The directions were precise, yet the sheer density of buildings, the unexpected cul-de-sacs, and the constant hum of life made navigation a delightful challenge. Finally, I arrived at the church, its façade less ornate than Redentore, but with a quiet dignity.\n\nThe church was already filled with an expectant crowd, a mixture of the curious public and serious connoisseurs. Behind a tall, decorative grating, the famed \"ladies\" of the conservatorio were preparing to perform an oratorio. The air thrummed with anticipation. When the music began, it was, as promised, magnificent. The voices were truly superb, soaring with a purity and power that transcended the physical barrier of the grating. An alto, singing the part of King Saul, possessed a voice of such depth and resonance that I had never before encountered its like. Certain passages of the music were excessively beautiful, stirring the soul with their melodic invention. The words, though Latin, were rendered with a distinctly Italianate pronunciation, almost \"laughably Italianized\" in places, yet perfectly adapted for the singing, bending to the melodic line with effortless grace. Music, here in Venice, truly had a boundless field to explore.\n\nThe enjoyment, however, was not without its vexations. The \"accursed Maestro di Capella,\" rather than conducting with subtlety, chose to beat time with a rolled sheet of music against the grating. It was a loud, conspicuous thwack, as if he were instructing a class of recalcitrant schoolboys. The girls, I felt, had surely rehearsed the piece to perfection, rendering his noisy intervention entirely unnecessary. His insistent thumping shattered the delicate atmosphere, destroying the impression much as if one were to stick \"scarlet patches on the joints\" of a beautiful statue to make it more intelligible. The foreign, intrusive sound was a jarring discord in the harmony. This man, a musician himself, seemed utterly insensible to the damage he inflicted. Or, more likely, he wished to assert his presence, to make his authority felt through this impropriety, when his true value should have been perceived through the flawless execution of his pupils. I had often attributed such crude displays to the French, but here, it seemed, the Italians were equally prone, and the public, astonishingly, appeared accustomed to it. It was a peculiar Venetian paradox: that which marred the enjoyment was, in some strange way, considered an integral part of the experience. It was not the first time I had observed this odd acceptance of imperfection in the pursuit of art here.",

It comes from Goethe's \"Letters from Switzerland and Travels in Italy\". Please bridge the gaps between the events that Goethe describes in a plausible way.\nOct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n\n\n--- [ID: 9a45d928-7a4d-46a4-98e5-ac00a3a153b6] WHOLE_TRAVEL_STORY_Goethe ---\n[HOW TO USE]: Here is the full chapter \"From Verona to Venice\" of Goethe's \"Letters from Switzerland and Travels in Italy\". It contains his whole travel story to Venice. The content of the augmented event must respect the broader context of Goethe's travel story.\nFROM VERONA TO VENICE.\nVerona, Sept. 16th.\nWell then, the amphitheatre is the first important monument of the old times that I have seen—and how well it is preserved! When I entered, and still more when I walked round the edge of it at the top, it seemed strange to me, that I saw something great, and yet, properly speaking, saw nothing. Besides I do not like to see it empty, I should like to see it full of people, just as, in modern times, it was filled up in honour of Joseph I. and Pius VI. The Emperor, although his eye was accustomed to human masses, must have been astonished. But it was only in the earliest times, that it produced its full effect, when the people was more a people than it is now. For, properly speaking, such an amphitheatre is constructed to give the people an imposing view of itself,—to cajole itself.\nWhen anything worth seeing occurs on the level ground, and any one runs to the spot, the hindermost try by every means to raise themselves above the foremost; they get upon benches, roll casks, bring up vehicles, lay planks in every direction, occupy the neighbouring heights, and a crater is formed in no time.\nIf the spectacle occur frequently on the same spot, light scaffoldings are built for those who are able to pay, and the rest of the multitude must get on as it can. Here the problem of the architect is to satisfy this general want. By means of his art he prepares such a crater, making it as simple as possible, that the people itself may constitute the decoration. When the populace saw itself so assembled, it must have been astonished at the sight, for whereas it was only accustomed to see itself running about in confusion, or to find itself crowded together without particular rule or order, so must this many-headed, many-minded, wandering animal now see itself combined into a noble body, made into a definite unity, bound and secured into a mass, and animated as one form by one mind. The simplicity of the oval is most pleasingly obvious to every eye, and every head serves as a measure to show the vastness of the whole. Now we see it empty, we have no standard, and do not know whether it is large or small.\nThe Veronese deserve commendation for the high preservation in which this edifice is kept. It is built of a reddish marble, which has been affected by the atmosphere, and hence the steps which have been eaten, are continually restored, and look almost all new. An inscription makes mention of one Hieronymus Maurigenus, and of the incredible industry, which he has expended on this monument. Of the outer wall only a piece remains, and I doubt whether it was ever quite finished. The lower arches, which adjoin the large square, called \"Il Bra,\" are let out to workmen, and the reanimation of these arcades produces a cheerful appearance.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe most beautiful gate, which, however, always remains closed, is called \"Porta stupa,\" or \"del Pallio.\" As a gate, and considering the great distance from which it is first seen, it is not well conceived, and it is not till we come near it, that we recognise the beauty of the structure.\nAll sorts of reasons are given to account for its being closed. I have, however, a conjecture of my own. It was manifestly the intention of the artist to cause a new Corso to be laid out from this gate, for the situation, or the present street, is completely wrong. On the left side there is nothing but barracks; and the line at right angles from the middle of the gate leads to a convent of nuns, which must certainly have come down. This was presently perceived, and besides the rich and higher classes might not have liked to settle in the remote quarter. The artist perhaps died, and therefore the door was closed, and so an end was put to the affair.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe portico of the theatre, consisting of six large Ionic columns, looks handsome enough. So much the more puny is the appearance of the Marchese di Maffei's bust, which as large as life, and in a great wig, stands over the door, and in front of a painted niche, which is supported by two Corinthian columns. The position is honorable, but to be in some degree proportionate to the magnitude and solidity of the columns, the bust should have been colossal. But now placed as it is on a corbel, it has a mean appearance, and is by no means in harmony with the whole.\nThe gallery, which incloses the fore-court, is also small, and the channelled Doric dwarfs have a mean appearance by the side of the smooth Ionic giants. But we pardon this discrepancy on account of the fine institution, which has been founded among the columns. Here is kept a number of antiquities, which have mostly been dug up in and about Verona. Something, they say, has even been found in the Amphitheatre. There are Etruscan, Greek, and Roman specimens, down to the latest times, and some even of more modern date. The bas-reliefs are inserted in the walls, and provided with the numbers, which Maffei gave them, when he described them in his work: \"Verona illustrata.\" There are altars, fragments of columns, and other relics of the sort; an admirable tripod of white marble, upon which there are genii occupied with the attributes of the gods. Raphael has imitated and improved this kind of thing in the scrolls of the Farnesina.\nThe wind which blows from the graves of the ancients, comes fragrantly over hills of roses. The tombs give touching evidences of a genuine feeling, and always bring life back to us. Here is a man, by the side of his wife, who peeps out of a niche, as if it were a window. Here are father and mother, with their son between them, eyeing each other as naturally as possible. Here a couple are grasping each other's hands. Here a father, resting on his couch, seems to be amused by his family. The immediate proximity of these stones was to me highly touching. They belong to a later school of art, but are simple, natural, and generally pleasing. Here a man in armour is on his knees in expectation of a joyful resurrection. With more or less of talent the artist has produced the mere simple presence of the persons, and has thus given a permanent continuation to their existence. They do not fold their hands, they do not look towards heaven, but they are here below just what they were and just what they are. They stand together, take interest in each other, love one another, and this is charmingly expressed on the stone, though with a certain want of technical skill. A marble pillar, very richly adorned, gave me more new ideas.\nLaudable as this institution is, we can plainly perceive that the noble spirit of preservation, by which it was founded, is no longer continued. The valuable tripod will soon be ruined, placed as it is in the open air, and exposed to the weather towards the west. This treasure might easily be preserved in a wooden case.\nThe palace of the Proveditore, which is begun, might have afforded a fine specimen of architecture, if it had been finished. Generally speaking, the nobili build a great deal, but unfortunately every one builds on the site of his former residence, and often, therefore, in narrow lanes. Thus, for instance, a magnificent façade to a seminary is now building in an alley of tire remotest suburb.\n\nWhile, with a guide, whom I had accidentally picked up, I passed before the great solemn gate of a singular building, he asked me good-humouredly, whether I should not like to step into the court for a while. It was the palace of justice, and the court, on account of the height of the building, looked only like an enormous wall. Here, he told me, all the criminals and suspicious persons are confined. I looked around, and saw that round all the stories there were open passages' fitted with iron balustrades, which passed by numerous doors. The prisoner, as he stepped out of his dungeon to be led to trial, stood in the open air, and was exposed to the gaze of all passers, and because there were several trial-rooms, the chains were rattling, now over this, now over that passage, in every story. It was a hateful sight, and I do not deny that the good humour, with which I had dispatched my \"Birds,\" might here have come into a strait.\n\nI walked at sunset upon the margin of the crater-like amphitheatre, and enjoyed the most splendid prospect over the town and the surrounding country. I was quite alone, and multitudes of people were passing below me on the hard stones of the Bra; men of all ranks, and women of the middle-ranks were walking. The latter in their black outer garments look, in this bird's-eye view, like so many mummies.\nThe Zendale and the Veste, which serves this class in the place of an entire wardrobe, is a costume completely fitted for a people that does not care much for cleanliness, and yet always likes to appear in public, sometimes at church, sometimes on the promenade. The Veste is a gown of black taffeta, which is thrown over other gowns. If the lady has a clean white one beneath, she contrives to lift up the black one on one side. This is fastened on so, as to cut the waist, and to cover the lappets of a corset, which may be of any colour. The Zendale is a large hood with long ears; the hood itself is kept high above the head by a wire-frame, while the ears are fastened round the body like a scarf, so that the ends fall down behind.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nWhen I again left the Arena to-day, I came to a modern public spectacle, about a thousand paces from the spot. Four noble Veronese were playing ball against four people of Vicenza. This pastime is carried on among the Veronese themselves all the year round, about two hours before night. On this occasion there was a far larger concourse of people than usual, on account of the foreign adversaries. The spectators seem to have amounted to four or five thousand. I did not see women of any rank.\nWhen, a little while ago, I spoke of the necessities of the multitude in such a case, I described the natural accidental amphitheatre as arising just in the manner, in which I saw the people raised one over another on this occasion. Even at a distance I could hear the lively clapping of hands, which accompanied every important stroke. The game is played as follows: Two boards, slightly inclined, are placed at a convenient distance from each other. He who strikes off the ball stands at the higher end, his right hand is armed with a broad wooden ring, set with spikes. While another of his party throws the ball to him, he runs down to meet it, and thus increases the force of the blow with which he strikes it. The adversaries try to beat it back, and thus it goes backwards and forwards till, at last, it remains on the ground. The most beautiful attitudes, worthy of being imitated in marble, are thus produced. As there are none but well-grown active young people, in a short, close, white dress, the parties are only distinguished by a yellow mark. Particularly beautiful is the attitude into which the man on the eminence falls, when he runs down the inclined plain, and raises his arm to strike the ball;—it approaches that of the Borghesian gladiator.\nIt seemed strange to me that they carry on this exercise by an old lime-wall, without the slightest convenience for spectators; why is it not done in the amphitheatre, where there would be such ample room?\n\nVerona, September 17.\nWhat I have seen of pictures I will but briefly touch upon, and add some remarks. I do not make this extraordinary tour for the sake of deceiving myself, but to become acquainted with myself by means of these objects. I therefore honestly confess that of the painter's art—of his manipulation, I understand but little. My attention, and observation, can only be directed to the practical part, to the subject, and the general treatment of it.\nS. Georgio is a gallery of good pictures, all altar-pieces, and all remarkable, if not of equal value. But what subjects were the hapless artists obliged to paint? And for whom? Perhaps a shower of manna thirty feet long, and twenty feet high, with the miracle of the loaves as a companion. What could be made of these subjects? Hungry men falling on little grains, and a countless multitude of others, to whom bread is handed. The artists have racked their invention in order to get something striking out of such wretched subjects. And yet, stimulated by the urgency of the case, genius has produced some beautiful things. An artist, who had to paint S. Ursula with the eleven thousand virgins, has got over the difficulty cleverly enough. The saint stands in the foreground, as if she had conquered the country. She is very noble, like an Amazonia's virgin, and without any enticing charms; on the other hand, her troop is shown descending from the ships, and moving in procession at a diminishing distance. The Assumption of the Virgin, by Titian, in the dome, has become much blackened, and it is a thought worthy of praise that, at the moment of her apotheosis, she looks not towards heaven, but towards her friends below.\nIn the Gherardini Gallery I found some very fine things by Orbitto, and for the first time became acquainted with this meritorious artist. At a distance we only hear of the first artists, and then we are often contented with names only; but when we draw nearer to this starry sky, and the luminaries of the second and third magnitude also begin to twinkle, each one coming forward and occupying his proper place in the whole constellation, then the world becomes wide, and art becomes rich. I must here commend the conception of one of the pictures. Sampson has gone to sleep in the lap of Dalilah, and she has softly stretched her hand over him to reach a pair of scissors, which lies near the lamp on the table. The execution is admirable. In the Canopa Palace I observed a Danäe.\nThe Bevilagua Palace contains the most valuable things. A picture by Tintoretto, which is called a \"Paradise,\" but which, in fact, represents the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, in the presence of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, saints, angels, &c., affords an opportunity for displaying all the riches of the most felicitous genius. To admire and enjoy all that care of manipulation, that spirit and variety of expression, it is necessary to possess the picture, and to have it before one all one's life. The painter's work is carried on ad infinitum,; even the farthest angels' heads, which are vanishing in the halo, preserve something of character. The largest figures may be about a foot high; Mary, and the Christ who is crowning her, about four inches. Eve is, however, the finest woman in the picture; a little voluptuous, as from time immemorial.\nA couple of portraits by Paul Veronese have only increased my veneration for that artist. The collection of antiquities is very fine; there is a son of Niobe extended in death, which is highly valuable; and the busts, including an Augustus with the civic crown, a Caligula, and others, are mostly of great interest, notwithstanding the restoration of the noses.\nIt lies in my nature to admire, willingly and joyfully, all that is great and beautiful, and the cultivation of this talent, day after day, hour after hour, by the inspection of such beautiful objects, produces the happiest feelings.\nIn a land, where we enjoy the days but take especial delight in the evenings, the time of nightfall is highly important. For now work ceases; those who have gone out walking turn back; the father wishes to have his daughter home again; the day has an end. What the day is we Cimmerians hardly know. In our eternal mist and fog it is the same thing to us, whether it be day or night, for how much time can we really pass and enjoy in the open air? Now, when night sets in, the day, which consisted of a morning and an evening, is decidedly past, four and twenty hours are gone, the bells ring, the rosary is taken in hand, and the maid, entering the chamber with the lighted lamp, says, \"felicissima notte.\" This epoch varies with every season, and a man who lives here in actual life cannot go wrong, because all the enjoyments of his existence are regulated not by the nominal hour, but by the time of day. If the people were forced to use a German clock they would be perplexed, for their own is intimately connected with their nature. About an hour and a half, or an hour before midnight, the nobility begin to ride out. They proceed to the Piazza della Bra, along the long, broad street to the Porta Nuova out at the gate, and along the city, and when night sets in, they all return home. Sometimes they go to the churches to say their Ave Maria della sera: sometimes they keep on the Bra, where the cavaliers step up to the coaches and converse for a while with the ladies. The foot passengers remain till a late hour of night, but I have never stopped till the last. To-day just enough rain had fallen to lay the dust, and the spectacle was most cheerful and animated.\nThat I may accommodate myself the better to the custom of the country I have devised a plan for mastering more easily the Italian method of reckoning the hours. The accompanying diagram may give an idea of it. The inner circle denotes our four and twenty hours, from midnight to midnight, divided into twice twelve, as we reckon, and as our clocks indicate. The middle circle shows how the clocks strike at the present season, namely, as much as twelve twice in the twenty-four hours, but in such a way that it strikes one, when it strikes eight with us, and so on till the number twelve is complete. At eight o'clock in the morning according to our clock it again strikes one, and so on. Finally the outer circle shows how the four and twenty hours are reckoned in actual life. For example, I hear seven o'clock striking in the night, and know that midnight is at five o'clock; I therefore deduct the latter number from the former, and thus have two hours after midnight. If I hear seven o'clock strike in the day-time, and know that noon is at five, I proceed in the same way, and thus have two in the afternoon. But if I wish to express the hour according to the fashion of this country, I must know that noon is seventeen o'clock; I add the two, and get nineteen o'clock. When this method is heard and thought of for the first time, it seems extremely confused and difficult to manage, but we soon grow accustomed to it and find the occupation amusing. The people themselves take delight in this perpetual calculation, just as children are pleased with easily surmounted difficulties. Indeed they always have their fingers in the air, make any calculation in their heads, and like to occupy themselves with figures. Besides to the inhabitant of the country the matter is so much the easier, as he really does not trouble himself about noon and midnight, and does not, like the foreign resident, compare two clocks with each other. They only count from the evening the hours, as they strike, and in the day-time they add the number to the varying number of noon, with which they are acquainted. The rest is explained by the remarks appended to the diagram:—\nVerona, Sept. 17.\nThe people here jostle one another actively enough; the narrow streets, where shops and workmen's stalls are thickly crowded together, have a particularly cheerful look. There is no such thing as a door in front of the shop or workroom; the whole breadth of the house is open, and one may see all that passes in the interior. Half-way out into the path, the tailors are sewing; and the cobblers are pulling and rapping; indeed the work-stalls make a part of the street. In the evening, when the lights are burning, the appearance is most lively.\nThe squares are very full on market days; there are fruit and vegetables without number, and garlic and onions to the heart's desire. Then again throughout the day there is a ceaseless screaming, bantering, singing, squalling, huzzaing, and laughing. The mildness of the air, and the cheapness of the food, make subsistence easy. Everything possible is done in the open air.\nAt night singing and all sorts of noises begin. The ballad of \"Marlbrook\" is heard in every street;—then comes a dulcimer, then a violin. They try to imitate all the birds with a pipe. The strangest sounds are heard on every side. A mild climate can give this exquisite enjoyment of mere existence, even to poverty, and the very shadow of the people seems respectable.\nThe want of cleanliness and convenience, which so much strikes us in the houses, arises from the following cause:—the inhabitants are always out of doors, and in their light-heartedness think of nothing. With the people all goes right, even the middle-class man just lives on from day to day, while the rich and genteel shut themselves up in their dwellings, which are not so habitable as in the north. Society is found in the open streets. Fore-courts and colonnades are all soiled with filth, for things are done in the most natural manner. The people always feel their way before them. The rich man may be rich, and build his palaces; and the nobile may rule, but if he makes a colonnade or a fore-court, the people will make use of it for their own occasions, and have no more urgent wish than to get rid as soon as possible, of that which they have taken as often as possible. If a person cannot bear this, he must not play the great gentleman, that is to say, he must act as if a part of his dwelling belonged to the public. He may shut his door, and all will be right. But in open buildings the people are not to be debarred of their privileges, and this, throughout Italy, is a nuisance to the foreigner.\nTo-day I remarked in several streets of the town, the customs and manners of the middle-classes especially, who appear very numerous and busy. They swing their arms as they walk. Persons of a high rank, who on certain occasions wear a sword, swing only one arm, being accustomed to hold the left arm still.\nAlthough the people are careless enough with respect to their own wants and occupations, they have a keen eye for everything foreign. Thus in the very first days, I observed that every one took notice of my boots, because here they are too expensive an article of dress to wear even in winter. Now I wear shoes and stockings nobody looks at me. Particularly I noticed this morning, when all were running about with flowers, vegetables, garlic, and other market-stuff, that a twig of cypress, which I carried in my hand, did not escape them. Some green cones hung upon it, and I held in the same hand some blooming caper-twigs. Everybody, large and small, watched me closely, and seemed to entertain some whimsical thought.\nI brought these twigs from the Giusti garden, which is finely situated, and in which there are monstrous cypresses, all pointed up like spikes into the air. The Taxus, which in northern gardening we find cut to a sharp point, is probably an imitation of this splendid natural product. A tree, the branches of which, the oldest as well as the youngest, are striving to reach heaven,—a tree which will last its three hundred years, is well worthy of veneration. Judging from the time when this garden was laid out, these trees have already attained that advanced age.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThe way from Verona hither is very pleasant: we go north-eastwards along the mountains, always keeping to the left the foremost mountains, which consist of sand, lime, clay, and marl; the hills which they form, are dotted with villages, castles, and houses. To the right extends the broad plain, along which the road goes. The straight broad path, which is in good preservation, goes through a fertile field; we look into deep avenues of trees, up which the vines are trained to a considerable height, and then drop down, like pendant branches. Here we can get an admirable idea of festoons! The grapes are ripe, and are heavy on the tendrils, which hang down long and trembling. The road is filled with people of every class and occupation, and I was particularly pleased by some carts, with low solid wheels, which, with teams of fine oxen, carry the large vats, in which the grapes from the vineyards are put and pressed. The drivers rode in them when they were empty, and the whole was like a triumphal procession of Bacchanals. Between the ranks of vines the ground is used for all sorts of grain, especially Indian corn and millet (Sörgel).\nAs one goes towards Vicenza, the hills again rise from north to south and enclose the plain; they are, it is said, volcanic. Vicenza lies at their foot, or if you will, in a bosom which they form.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThough I have been here only a few hours, I have already run through the town, and seen the Olympian theatre, and the buildings of Palladio. A very pretty little book is published here, for the convenience of foreigners, with copper-plates and some letter-press, that shows knowledge of art. When once one stands in the presence of these works, one immediately perceives their great value, for they are calculated to fill the eye with their actual greatness and massiveness, and to satisfy the mind by the beautiful harmony of their dimensions, not only in abstract sketches, but with all the prominences and distances of perspective. Therefore I say of Palladio: he was a man really and intrinsically great, whose greatness was outwardly manifested. The chief difficulty with which this man, like all modern architects, had to struggle, was the suitable application of the orders of columns to buildings for domestic or public use; for there is always a contradiction in the combination of columns and walls. But with what success has he not worked them up together! What an imposing effect has the aspect of his edifices: at the sight of them one almost forgets that he is attempting to reconcile us to a violation of the rules of his art. There is, indeed, something divine about his designs, which may be exactly compared to the creations of the great poet, who, out of truth and falsehood elaborates something between both, and charms us with its borrowed existence.\nThe Olympic theatre is a theatre of the ancients, realized on a small scale, and indescribably beautiful. However, compared with our theatres, it reminds me of a genteel, rich, well-bred child, contrasted with a shrewd man of the world, who, though he is neither so rich, nor so genteel, and well-bred, knows better how to employ his resources.\nIf we contemplate, on the spot, the noble buildings which Palladio has erected, and see how they are disfigured by the mean filthy necessities of the people, how the plans of most of them exceeded the means of those who undertook them, and how little these precious monuments of one lofty mind are adapted to all else around, the thought occurs, that it is just the same with everything else; for we receive but little thanks from men, when we would elevate their internal aspirations, give them a great idea of themselves, and make them feel the grandeur of a really noble existence. But when one cajoles them, tells them tales, and helping them on from day to day, makes them worse, then one is just the man they like; and hence it is that modern times take delight in so many absurdities. I do not say this to lower my friends, I only say that they are so, and that people must not be astonished to find everything just as it is.\nHow the Basilica of Palladio looks by the side of an old castellated kind of a building, dotted all over with windows of different sizes (whose removal, tower and all, the artist evidently contemplated),—it is impossible to describe—and besides I must now, by a strange effort, compress my own feelings, for, I too, alas! find here side by side both what I seek and what I fly from.\n\nSept. 20.\nYesterday we had the opera, which lasted till midnight, and I was glad to get some rest. The three Sultanesses and the Rape of the Seraglio have afforded several tatters, out of which the piece has been patched up, with very little skill. The music is agreeable to the ear, but is probably by an amateur; for not a single thought struck me as being new. The ballets, on the other hand, were charming. The principle pair of dancers executed an Allemande to perfection.\nThe theatre is new, pleasant, beautiful, modestly magnificent, uniform throughout, just as it ought to be in a provincial town. Every box has hangings of the same color, and the one belonging to the Capitan Grande, is only distinguished from the rest, by the fact that the hangings are somewhat longer.\nThe prima donna, who is a great favorite of the whole people, is tremendously applauded, on her entrance, and the \"gods\" are quite obstreperous with their delight, when she does anything remarkably well, which very often happens. Her manners are natural, she has a pretty figure, a fine voice, a pleasing countenance, and, above all, a really modest demeanour, while there might be more grace in the arms. However, I am not what I was, I feel that I am spoiled, I am spoiled for a \"god.\"\n\nSept. 21.\nTo-day I visited Dr. Tura. Five years ago he passionately devoted himself to the study of plants, formed a herbarium of the Italian flora, and laid out a botanical garden under the superintendence of the former bishop. However, all that has come to an end. Medical practice drove away natural history, the herbarium is eaten by worms, the bishop is dead, and the botanic garden is again rationally planted with cabbages and garlic.\nDr. Tura is a very refined and good man. He told me his history with frankness, purity of mind, and modesty, and altogether spoke in a very definite and affable manner. At the same time he did not like to open his cabinets, which perhaps were in no very presentable condition. Our conversation soon came to a stand-still.\n\nSept. 21. Evening.\nI called upon the old architect Scamozzi, who has published an edition of Palladio's buildings, and is a diligent artist, passionately devoted to his art. He gave me some directions, being delighted with my sympathy. Among Palladio's buildings there is one, for which I always had an especial predilection, and which is said to have been his own residence When it is seen close, there is far more in it than appears in a picture. I should have liked to draw it, and to illuminate it with colors, to show the material and the age. It must not, however, be imagined that the architect has built himself a palace. The house is the most modest in the world, with only two windows, separated from each other by a broad space, which would admit a third. If it were imitated in a picture, which should exhibit the neighbouring houses at the same time, the spectator would be pleased to observe how it has been let in between them. Canaletto was the man who should have painted it.\n\nTo-day I visited the splendid building which stands on a pleasant elevation about half a league from the town, and is called the \"Rotonda.\" It is a quadrangular building, enclosing a circular hall, lighted from the top. On all the four sides, you ascend a broad flight of steps, and always come to a vestibule, which is formed of six Corinthian columns. Probably the luxury of architecture was never carried to so high a point. The space occupied by the steps and vestibules is much larger than that occupied by the house itself; for every one of the sides is as grand and pleasing as the front of a temple. With respect to the inside it may be called habitable, but not comfortable. The hall is of the finest proportions, and so are the chambers; but they would hardly suffice for the actual wants of any genteel family in a summer-residence. On the other hand it presents a most beautiful appearance, as it is viewed on every side throughout the district. The variety which is produced by the principal mass, as, together with the projecting columns, it is gradually brought before the eyes of the spectator who walks round it, is very great; and the purpose of the owner, who wished to leave a large trust-estate, and at the same time a visible monument of his wealth, is completely obtained. And while the building appears in all its magnificence, when viewed from any spot in the district, it also forms the point of view for a most agreeable prospect. You may see the Bachiglione flowing along, and taking vessels down from Verona to the Brenta, while you overlook the extensive possessions which the Marquis Capra wished to preserve undivided in his family. The inscriptions on the four gable-ends, which together constitute one whole, are worthy to be noted down:\nMarcus Capra Gabrielis filius\nQui ædes has Arctissimo\nprimogenituræ gradui subjecit\nUna cum omnibus\nCensibus agrisvallibus et collibus\nCitra viam magnam\nMemorise perpetuæ mandans hæc\nDum sustinet ac abstinet.\nThe conclusion in particular is strange enough. A man who has at command so much wealth and such a capacious will, still feels that he must bear and forbear. This can be learned at a less expense.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis evening I was at a meeting held by the academy of the \"Olympians.\" It is mere play-work, but good in its way, and seems to keep up a little spice and life among the people. There is the great hall by Palladio's theatre, handsomely lighted up; the Capitan and a portion of the nobility are present, besides a public composed of educated persons, and several of the clergy; the whole assembly amounting to about five hundred.\nThe question proposed by the president for to-day's sitting was this: \"Which has been most serviceable to the fine arts, invention or imitation?\" This was a happy notion, for if the alternatives which are involved in the question are kept duly apart, one may go on debating for centuries. The academicians have gallantly availed themselves of the occasion, and have produced all sorts of things in prose and verse,—some very good.\nThen there is the liveliest public. The audience cry bravo, and clap their hands and laugh. What a thing it is to stand thus before one's nation, and amuse them in person! We must set down our best productions in black and white; every one squats down with them in a corner, and scribbles at them as he can.\nIt may be imagined that even on this occasion Palladio would be continually appealed to, whether the discourse was in favour of invention or imitation. At the end, which is always the right place for a joke, one of the speakers hit on a happy thought, and said that the others had already taken Palladio away from him, so that he, for his part, would praise Franceschini, the great silk-manufacturer. He then began to show the advantages which this enterprising man, and through him the city of Vicenza, had derived from imitating the Lyonnese and Florentine stuffs, and thence came to the conclusion that imitation stands far above invention. This was done with so much humour, that uninterrupted laughter was excited. Generally those who spoke in favor of imitation obtained the most applause, for they said nothing but what was adapted to the thoughts and capacities of the multitude. Once the public, by a violent clapping of hands, gave its hearty approval to a most clumsy sophism, when it had not felt many good—nay, excellent things, that had been said in honour of invention. I am very glad I have witnessed this scene, for it is highly gratifying to see Palladio, after the lapse of so long a time, still honoured by his fellow-citizens, as their polar-star and model.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis morning I was at Tiene, which lies north towards the mountains, where a new building has been erected after an old plan, of which there may be a little to say. Thus do they here honour everything that belongs to the good period, and have sense enough to raise a new building on a plan which they have inherited. The château is excellently situated in a large plain, having behind it the calcareous Alps, without any mountains intervening. A stream of living water flows along the level causeway from each side of the building, towards those who approach it, and waters the broad fields of rice through which one passes.\nI have now seen but two Italian cities, and for the first time, and have spoken with but few persons, and yet I know my Italians pretty well. They are like courtiers, who consider themselves the first people in the world, and who, on the strength of certain advantages, which cannot be denied them, can indulge with impunity in so comfortable a thought. The Italians appear to me a right good people. Only one must see the children and the common people as I see them now, and can see them, while I am always open to them,—nay, always lay myself open to them. What figures and faces there are!\nIt is especially to be commended in the Vicentians, that with them one enjoys the privileges of a large city. Whatever a person does, they do not stare at him, but if he addresses them, they are conversable and pleasant, especially the women, who please me much. I do not mean to find fault with the Veronese women; they are well made and have a decided pupil, but they are, for the most part, pale, and the Zendal is to their disadvantage, because one looks for something charming under the beautiful costume. I have found here some very pretty creatures, especially some with black locks, who inspire me with peculiar interest. There are also fairer beauties who, however, do not please me so well.\n\nPadua, Sept. 26. Evening.\nIn four hours I have this day come here from Vicenza, crammed luggage and all into a little one-seated chaise, called a \"Sediola.\" Generally the journey is performed with ease in three hours and a half, but as I wished to pass the delightful day-time in the open air, I was glad that the Vetturino fell short of his duty. The route goes constantly southwards over the most fertile plains, and between hedges and trees, without further prospect, until at last the beautiful mountains, extending from the east towards the south, are seen on the right hand. The abundance of the festoons of plants and fruit, which hang over walls and hedges, and down the trees, is indescribable. The roofs are loaded with gourds, and the strangest sort of cucumbers are hanging from poles and trellises.\nFrom the observatory I could take the clearest survey possible of the fine situation of the town. Towards the north are the Tyrolese mountains, covered with snow, and half hidden by clouds, and joined by the Vicentian mountains on the north-west. Then towards the west are the nearer mountains of Este, the shapes and recesses of which are plainly to be seen. Towards the south-east is a verdant sea of plants, without a trace of elevation, tree after tree, bush after bush, plantation after plantation, while houses, villas, and churches, dazzling with whiteness, peer out from among the green. Against the horizon I plainly saw the tower of St. Mark's at Venice, with other smaller towers.\n\nPadua, Sept. 27.\nI have at last obtained the works of Palladio, not indeed the original edition, which I saw at Vicenza, where the cuts are in wood, but a fac-simile in copper, published at the expense of an excellent man, named Smith, who was formerly the English consul at Venice. We must give the English this credit, that they have long known how to prize what is good, and have a magnificent way of diffusing it.\nOn the occasion of this purchase I entered a book-shop, which in Italy presents quite a peculiar appearance. Around it are arranged the books, all stitched, and during the whole day good society may be found in the shop, which is a lounge for all the secular clergy, nobility, and artists who are in any way connected with literature. One asks for a book, opens it, and amuses himself as one can. Thus I found a knot of half a dozen all of whom became attentive to me, when I asked for the works of Palladio. While the master of the shop looked for the book, they commended it, and gave me information respecting the original and the copy; they were well acquainted with the work itself and with the merits of the author. Taking me for an architect they praised me for having recourse to this master in preference to all the rest, saying that he was of more practical utility than Vitruvius himself, since he had thoroughly studied the ancients and antiquity, and had sought to adapt the latter to the wants of our own times. I conversed for a long time with these friendly men, learned something about the remarkable objects in the city, and took my leave.\nWhere men have built churches to saints, a place may sometimes be found in them, where monuments to intellectual men may be set up. The bust of Cardinal Bembo stands between Ionic columns. It is a handsome face, strongly drawn in, if I may use the expression, and with a copious beard. The inscription runs thus: \"Petri Bembi Card. imaginem Hier. Guerinus Ismeni f. in publico ponendam curavit ut cujus ingenii monumenta æterna sint, ejus corporis quoque memoria ne a posteritate desideretur.\"\nWith all its dignity the University gave me the horrors, as a building. I am glad that I had nothing to learn in it. One cannot imagine such a narrow compass for a school, even though, as the student of a German university, one may have suffered a great deal on the benches of the Auditorium. The anatomical theatre is a perfect model of the art of pressing students together. The audience are piled one above another in a tall pointed funnel. They look down upon the narrow space where the table stands, and, as no daylight falls upon it, the Professor must demonstrate by lamplight. The botanic garden is much more pretty and cheerful. Several plants can remain in the ground during the winter, if they are set near the walls, or at no great distance from them. At the end of October the whole is built over, and the process of heating is carried on for the few remaining months. It is pleasant and instructive to walk through a vegetation that is strange to us. With ordinary plants, as well as with other objects that have been long familiar to us, we at last do not think at all, and what is looking without thinking? Amidst this variety which comes upon me quite new, the idea that all forms of plants may, perhaps, be developed from a single form, becomes more lively than ever. On this principle alone it would be possible to define orders and classes, which, it seems to me, has hitherto been done in a very arbitrary manner. At this point I stand fast in my botanical philosophy, and I do not see how I am to extricate myself. The depth and breadth of this business seem to me quite equal.\nThe great square, called Prato della Valle, is a very wide space, where the chief fair is held in June. The wooden booths in the middle of it do not produce the most favourable appearance, but the inhabitants assure me that there will soon be a fièra of stone here, like that at Verona. One has hopes of this already, from the manner in which the Prato is surrounded, and which affords a very beautiful and imposing view.\nA huge oval is surrounded with statues, all representing celebrated men, who have taught or studied at the University. Any native or foreigner is allowed to erect a statue of a certain size to any countryman or kinsman, as soon as the merit of the person and his academical residence at Padua are proved.\nA moat filled with water goes round the oval. On the four bridges which lead up to it stand colossal figures of Popes and Doges; the other statues, which are smaller, have been set up by corporations, private individuals, or foreigners. The King of Sweden caused a figure of Gustavus Adolphus to be erected, because it is said he once heard a lecture in Padua. The Archduke Leopold revived the memory of Petrarch and Galileo. The statues are in a good, modern style, a few of them rather affected, some very natural, and all in the costume of their rank and dignity. The inscriptions deserve commendation. There is nothing in them absurd or paltry.\nAt any university the thought would have been a happy one (and here it is particularly so), because it is very delightful to see a whole line of departed worthies thus called back again. It will perhaps form a very beautiful Prato, when the wooden Fièra shall be removed, and one built of stone, according to the aforesaid plan.\nIn the consistory of a fraternity dedicated to S. Anthony, there are some pictures of an early date, which remind one of the old German paintings, and also some by Titian, in which may be remarked the great progress which no one has made on the other side of the Alps. Immediately afterwards I saw works by some of the most modern painters. These artists, as they could not hope to succeed in the lofty and the serious, have been very happy in hitting the humorous. The decollation of John by Piazetta is, in this sense, a capital picture, if one can once allow the master's manner. John is kneeling, with his hands before him, and his right knee on a stone, looking towards heaven. One of the soldiers, who is binding him, is bending round on one side, and looking into his face, as if he was wondering at his patient resignation. Higher up stands another, who is to deal the fatal blow. He does not, however, hold the sword, but makes a motion with his hands, like one who is practising the stroke beforehand. A third is drawing the sword out of the scabbard. The thought is happy, if not grand, and the composition is striking and produces the best effect.\nIn the church of the Eremitani I have seen pictures by Mantegna, one of the older painters, at which I am astonished. What a sharp, strict actuality is exhibited in these pictures! It is from this actuality, thoroughly true, not apparent, merely and falsely effective, and appealing solely to the imagination, but solid, pure, bright, elaborated, conscientious, delicate, and circumscribed—an actuality which had about it something severe, credulous, and laborious; it is from this, I say, that the later painters proceeded (as I remarked in the pictures of Titian), in order that by the liveliness of their own genius, the energy of their nature illumined at the same time by the mind of the predecessors, and exalted by their force, they might rise higher and higher, and elevated above the earth, produce forms that were heavenly indeed, but still true. Thus was art developed after the barbarous period.\nThe hall of audience in the town-house, properly designated by the augmentative \"Salone,\" is such a huge inclosure that one cannot conceive it, much less recall it to one's immediate memory. It is three hundred feet long, one hundred feet broad, and one hundred feet high, measured up to the roof, which covers it quite in. So accustomed are these people to live in the open air, that the architects look out for a market-place to over-arch. And there is no question that this huge vaulted space produces quite a peculiar effect. It is an inclosed infinity, which has more analogy to man's habits and feelings than the starry heavens. The latter takes us out of ourselves, the former insensibility brings us back to ourselves.\nFor the same reason I also like to stay in the Church of S. Justina. This church, which is eighty-five feet long, and high and broad in proportion, is built in a grand and simple style. This evening I seated myself in a corner, and indulged in quiet contemplation. Then I felt myself truly alone, for no one in the world, even if he had thought of me for the moment, would have looked for me here.\nNow everything ought to be packed up again, for to-morrow morning I set off by water, upon the Brenta. It rained to-day, but now it has cleared up, and I hope I shall be able to see the lagunes and the Bride of the Sea by beautiful daylight, and to greet my friends from her bosom.\n\nVENICE\nNow it stood written on my page in the Book of Fate, that on the evening of the 28th of September, by 5 o'clock, German time, I should see Venice for the first time, as I passed from the Brenta into the lagunes, and that, soon afterwards, I should actually enter: and visit this strange island-city, this heaven-like republic. So now, Heaven be praised, Venice is no longer to me a bare and a hollow name, which has so long tormented me,—me, the mental enemy of mere verbal sounds.\nAs the first of the gondoliers came up to the ship (they come in order to convey more quickly to Venice those passengers who are in a hurry), I recollected an old plaything, of which, perhaps, I had not thought for twenty years. My father had a beautiful model of a gondola which he had brought with him [from Italy]; he set a great value upon it, and it was considered a great treat, when I was allowed to play with it. The first beaks of tinned iron-plate, the black gondola-gratings, all greeted me like old acquaintances, and I experienced again dear emotions of my childhood which had been long unknown.\nI am well lodged at the sign of the Queen of England, not far from the square of S. Mark, which is, indeed, the chief advantage of the snot. My windows look upon a narrow canal between lofty houses, a bridge of one arch is immediately below me, and directly opposite is a narrow, bustling alley. Thus am I lodged, and here I shall remain until I have made up my packet for Germany, and until I am satiated with the sight of the city. I can now really enjoy the solitude for which I have longed so ardently, for nowhere does a man feel himself more solitary than in a crowd, where he must push his way unknown to every one. Perhaps in Venice there is only one person who knows me, and he will not come in contact with me all at once.\n\nVenice, September 28, 1786.\nA few words on my journey hither from Padua. The passage on the Brenta, in the public vessel, and in good company, is highly agreeable. The banks are ornamented with gardens and villas, little hamlets come down to the water's edge, and the animated highroad may be seen here and there. As the descent of the river is by means of locks, there is often a little pause, which may be employed in looking about the country, and in tasting the fruits, which are offered in great abundance. You then enter your vessel again, and move on through a world, which is itself in motion, and which is full of life and fertility.\nTo so many changing forms and images a phenomenon was added, which, although derived from Germany, was quite in its place here—I mean two pilgrims, the first whom I have seen closely. They have a right to travel gratis in this public conveyance; but because the rest of the passengers dislike coming into contact with them, they do not sit in the covered part, but in the after-part beside the steersman. They were stared at as a phenomenon even at the present day, and as in former times many vagabonds had made use of this cloak, they were but lightly esteemed. When I learned that they were Germans, and could speak no language but their own, I joined them, and found that they came from the Paderborn territory. Both of them were men of more than fifty years of age, and of a dark, but good-humoured physiognomy. They had first visited the sepulchre of the \"Three Kings\" at Cologne, had then travelled through Germany, and were now together on their way back to Borne and Upper Italy, whence one intended to set out for Westphalia, and the other to pay a visit of adoration to St. James of Compostella.\nTheir dress was the well-known costume of pilgrims, but they looked much better with this tucked up robe, than the pilgrims in long taffeta garments, we are accustomed to exhibit at our masquerades. The long cape, the round hat, the staff and cockle (the latter used as the most innocent drinking-vessel)—all had its signification, and its immediate use, while a tin-case held their passports. Most remarkable of all were their small, red morocco pocket-books, in which they kept all the little implements that might be wanted for any simple necessity. They took them out on finding that something wanted mending in their garments.\nThe steersman, highly pleased to find an interpreter, made me ask them several questions, and thus I learned a great deal about their views, and especially about their expedition. They made bitter complaints against their brethren in the faith, and even against the clergy, both secular and monastic. Piety, they said, must be a very scarce commodity, since no one would believe in theirs, but they were treated as vagrants in almost every Catholic country, although they produced the route which had been clerically prescribed, and the passports given by the bishop. On the other hand, they described, with a great deal of emotion, how well they had been received by protestants, and made special mention of a country clergyman in Suabia, and still more of his wife, who had prevailed on her somewhat unwilling husband to give them an abundant repast, of which they stood in great need. On taking leave, the good couple had given them a \"convention's dollar,\"[3] which they found very serviceable, as soon as they entered the Catholic territory. Upon this, one of them said, with all the elevation of which he was capable: \"We include this lady every day in our prayers, and implore God that he will open her eyes, as he has opened her heart towards us, and take her, although late, into the bosom of the Catholic Church. And thus we hope that we shall meet her in Paradise hereafter.\"\nAs I sat upon the little gang-way which led to the deck, I explained as much as was necessary and useful to the steers-man, and to some other persons who had crowded from the cabin into this narrow space. The pilgrims received some paltry donations, for the Italian is not fond of giving. Upon this they drew out some little consecrated tickets, on which might be seen the representation of the three sainted kings, with some prayers addressed to them. The worthy men entreated me to distribute these tickets among the little party, and explain how invaluable they were. In this I succeeded perfectly, for when the two men appeared to be greatly embarrassed as to how they should find the convent devoted to pilgrims in so large a place as Venice, the steersman was touched, and promised that, when they landed, he would give a boy a trifle to lead them to that distant spot. He added to me in confidence, that they would find but little welcome. \"The institution,\" he said, \"was founded to admit I don't know how many pilgrims, but now it has become greatly contracted, and the revenues are otherwise employed.\"\nDuring this conversation we had gone down the beautiful Brenta, leaving behind us many a noble garden, and many a noble palace, and casting a rapid glance at the populous and thriving hamlets, which lay along the banks. Several gondolas wound about the ship as soon as we had entered the lagunes. A Lombard, well acquainted with Venice, asked me to accompany him, that we might enter all the quicker, and escape the nuisance of the custom-house. Those who endeavoured to hold us back, he contrived to put off with a little drink-money, and so, in a cheerful sunset, we floated to the place of our destination.\n[3]\nA \"convention's dollar\" is a dollar coined in consequence of an agreement made between several of the German states, in the year 1750, when the Viennese standard was adopted.—Trans.\n\nSept. 29 (Michaelmas-Day). Evening.\nSo much has already been told and printed about Venice, that I shall not be circumstantial in my description, but shall only say how it struck me. Now, in this instance again, that which makes the chief impression upon me, is the people,—a great mass, who live an involuntary existence determined by the changing circumstances of the moment.\nIt was for no idle fancy that this race fled to these islands; it was no mere whim which impelled those who followed to combine with them; necessity taught them to look for security in a highly disadvantageous situation, that afterwards became most advantageous, enduing them with talent, when the whole northern world was immersed in gloom. Their increase and their wealth were a necessary consequence. New dwellings arose close against dwellings, rocks took the place of sand and marsh, houses sought the sky, being forced like trees inclosed in a narrow compass, to seek in height what was denied them in breadth. Being niggards of every inch of ground, as having been from the very first compressed into a narrow compass, they allowed no more room for the streets than was just necessary to separate a row of houses from the one opposite, and to afford the citizens a narrow passage. Moreover, water supplied the place of street, square, and promenade. The Venetian was forced to become a new creature; and thus Venice can only be compared with itself. The large canal, winding like a serpent, yields to no street in the world, and nothing can be put by the side of the space in front of St. Mark's square—I mean that great mirror of water, which is encompassed by Venice Proper, in the form of a crescent. Across the watery surface you see to the left the island of St. Georgio Maggiore, to the right a little, further off the Guidecca and its canal, and still more distant the Dogana (Custom-house) and the entrance into the Canal Grande, where right before us two immense marble temples are glittering in the sunshine. All the views and prospects have been so often engraved, that my friends will have no difficulty in forming a clear idea of them.\nAfter dinner I hastened to fix my first impression of the whole, and without a guide, and merely observing the cardinal points, threw myself into the labyrinth of the city, which though everywhere intersected by larger or smaller canals, is again connected by bridges. The narrow and crowded appearance of the whole cannot be conceived by one who has not seen it. In most cases one can quite or nearly measure the breadth of the street, by stretching out one's arms, and in the narrowest, a person would scrape his elbows if he walked with his arms a-kimbo. Some streets, indeed, are wider, and here and there is a little square, but comparatively all may be called narrow.\nI easily found the grand canal, and the principal bridge—the Rialto, which consists of a single arch of white marble. Looking down from this, one has a fine prospect,—the canal full of ships, which bring every necessary from the continent, and put in chiefly at this place to unload, while between them is a swarm of gondolas. To-day, especially, being Michaelmas, the view was wonderfully animated; but to give some notion of it, I must go back a little.\nThe two principal parts of Venice, which are divided by the grand canal, are connected by no other bridge than the Rialto, but several means of communication are provided, and the river is crossed in open boats at certain fixed points. To-day a very pretty effect was produced, by the number of well-dressed ladies, who, their features concealed beneath large black veils, were being ferried over in large parties at a time, in order to go to the church of the Archangel, whose festival was being solemnised. I left the bridge and went to one of the points of landing, to see the parties as they left the boats. I discovered some very fine forms and faces among them.\nAfter I had become tired of this amusement. I seated myself in a gondola, and, quitting the narrow streets with the intention of witnessing a spectacle of an opposite description, went along the northern part of the grand canal, into the lagunes, and then entered the canal della Guidecca, going as far as the square of St. Mark. Now was I also one of the birds of the Adriatic sea, as every Venetian feels himself to be, whilst reclining in his gondola. I then thought with due honour of my good father, who knew of nothing better than to talk about the things I now witnessed. And will it not be so with me likewise? All that surrounds me is dignified—a grand venerable work of combined human energies, a noble monument, not of a ruler, but of a people. And if their lagunes are gradually filling up, if unwholesome vapours are floating over the marsh, if their trade is declining and their power has sunk, still the great place and the essential character will not for a moment, be less venerable to the observer. Venice succumbs to time, like everything that has a phenomenal existence.\n\nSept. 30.\nTowards evening I again rambled, without a guide, into the remotest quarters of the city. The bridges here are all provided with stairs, that gondolas, and even larger vessels, may pass conveniently under the arches. I sought to find my way in and out of this labyrinth, without asking anybody, and, on this occasion also, only guiding myself by the points of the compass. One disentangles one's self at last, but it is a wonderful complication, and my manner of obtaining a sensible impression of it, is the best. I have now been to the remotest points of the city, and observed the conduct, mode of life, manners, and character of the inhabitants; and in every quarter they are different. Gracious Heaven!—What a poor good sort of animal man is, after all!\nMost of the smaller houses stand immediately on the canals, but there are here and there quays of stone, beautifully paved, along which one may take a pleasant walk between the water, and the churches, and palaces. Particularly cheerful and agreeable is the long stone quay on the northern side, from which the islands are visible, especially Murano, which is a Venice on a small scale. The intervening lagunes are all alive with little gondolas.\n\nSept. 30. Evening.\nTo-day I have enlarged my notions of Venice by procuring a plan of it. When I had studied it for some time, I ascended the tower of St. Mark, where an unique spectacle is presented to the eye. It was noon, and the sun was so bright that I could see places near and distant without a glass. The tide covered the lagunes, and when I turned my eyes towards what is called the Lido (this is a narrow strip of earth, which bounds the lagunes), I saw the sea for the first time with some sails upon it. In the lagunes themselves some gallies and frigates are lying, destined to join the Chevalier Emo, who is making war on the Algerines, but detained by unfavorable winds. The mountains of Padua and Vicenza, and the mountain-chain of Tyrol, beautifully bound the picture between the north and west.\n\nOctober 1.\nI went out and surveyed the city from many points of view, and as it was Sunday, I was struck by the great want of cleanliness in the streets, which forced me to make some reflections. There seems to be a sort of policy in this matter, for the people scrape the sweepings into the corners, and I see large ships going backwards and forwards, which at several points He to, and take off the accumulation. They belong to the people of the surrounding islands, who are in want of manure. But, however, there is neither consistency nor strictness in this method, and the want of cleanliness in the city is the more unpardonable, as in it, as much provision has been made for cleaning it, as in any Dutch town.\nAll the streets are paved—even those in the remotest quarters, with bricks at least, which are laid down lengthwise, with the edges slightly canting: the middle of the street where necessary is raised a little, while channels are formed on each side to receive the water, and convey it into covered drains. There are other architectural arrangements in the original well-considered plan, which prove the intention of the excellent architects to make Venice the most cleanly, as well as the most singular of cities. As I walked along I could not refrain from sketching a body of regulations on the subject, anticipating in thought some superintendent of police, who might act in earnest. Thus one always feels an inclination to sweep one's neighbour's door.\n\nOct. 2, 1786.\nBefore all things I hastened to the Carità. I had found in Palladio's works that he had planned a monastic building here, in which he intended to represent a private residence of the rich and hospitable ancients. The plan, which was excellently drawn, both as a whole and in detail, gave me infinite delight, and I hoped to find a marvel. Alas! scarcely a tenth part of the edifice is finished. However, even this part is worthy of that heavenly genius. There is a completeness in the plan, and an accuracy in the execution, which I had never before witnessed. One ought to pass whole years in the contemplation of such a work. It seems to me that I have seen nothing grander, nothing more perfect, and I fancy that I am not mistaken. Only imagine the admirable artist, born with an inner feeling for the grand and the pleasing, now, for the first time, forming himself by the ancients, with incredible labour, that he may be the means of reviving them. He finds an opportunity to carry out a favorite thought in building a convent, which is destined as a dwelling for so many monks, and a shelter for so many strangers, in the form of an antique private residence.\nThe church was already standing and led to an atrium of Corinthian columns. Here one feels delighted, and forgets all priestcraft. At one end, the sacristy, at another, a chapter-room is found, while there is the finest winding stair-case in the world, with a wide well, and the stone-steps built into the wall, and so laid, that one supports another. One is never tired of going up and down this stair-case, and we may judge of its success, from the fact that Palladio himself declares that he has succeeded. The fore-court leads to the large inner-court. Unfortunately, nothing is finished of the building which was to surround this, except the left side. Here there are three rows of columns, one over the other; on the ground-floor are the halls, on the first story is an archway in front of the cells, and the upper story consists of a plain wall with windows. However, this description should be illustrated by a reference to the sketches. I will just add a word about the execution.\nOnly the capitals and bases of the columns, and the key-stones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is—I will not say of brick, but-of burned clay. This description of tile I never saw before. The frieze and cornice are of the same material, as well as the parts of the arch. All is but half burnt, and lastly the building is put together with a very little lime. As it stands it looks as if it had been produced at one cast. If the whole had been finished, and it had been properly rubbed up and coloured, it would have been a charming sight.\nHowever, as so often happens with buildings of a modern time, the plan was too large. The artist had pre-supposed not only that the existing convent would be pulled down, but also that the adjoining houses would be bought, and here money and inclination probably began to fail. Kind Destiny, thou who hast formed and perpetuated so much stupidity, why didst thou not allow this work to be completed!\n\nOct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n\nOctober 3.\nYesterday evening I went to the Opera at the S. Moses (for the theatres take their name from the church to which they lie nearest); nothing very delightful! In the plan, the music, and the singers, that energy was wanting, which alone can elevate opera to the highest point. One could not say of any part that it was bad, but the two female actresses alone took pains, not so much to act well, but to set themselves off and to please. That is something, after all. These two actresses have beautiful figures, and good voices, and are nice, lively, compact, little bodies. Among the men, on the other hand, there is no trace of national power, or even of pleasure, in working on the imaginations of their audience. Neither is there among them any voice of decided brilliancy.\nThe ballet, which was wretchedly conceived, was condemned as a whole, but some excellent dancers and danseuses, the latter of whom considered it their duty to make the spectators acquainted with all their person charms, were heartily applauded.\n\nOctober 5.\nTo-day, however, I saw another comedy, which gave me more pleasure. In the ducal palace I heard the public discussion of a law case. It was important, and, happily for me, was brought forward in the holidays. One of the advocates had all the qualifications for an exaggerated buffo. His figure was short and fat, but supple; in profile his features were monstrously prominent. He had a stentorian voice, and a vehemence as if everything that he said came in earnest from the very bottom of his heart. I call this a comedy, because, probably, everything had been already prepared when the public exhibition took place. The judges knew what they had to say, and the parties what they had to expect. However, this plan pleases me infinitely more than our hobbling law affairs. I will endeavor to give some notion of the particulars, and of the neat, natural, and unostentatious manner in which everything takes place.\nIn a spacious hall of the palace the judges were sitting on one side, in a half circle. Opposite to them, in a tribune which could hold several persons, were the advocates for both parties; and upon a bench immediately in front of them, the plantiff, and defendant in person. The advocate for the plaintiff had descended from the tribune, since there was to be no controversy at this day's sitting. All the documents, on both sides, were to be read, although they were already printed.\nA lean clerk, in a black scanty gown, and with a thick bundle in his hand, prepared to perform the office of a reader. The hall was completely crammed with persons who came to see and to hear. The point of law itself, and the persons whom it concerned, must have appeared highly important to the Venetians.\nTrust-estates are so decidedly secured in Venice, that a property once stamped with this character, preserves it for ever, though it may have been divested ages ago by appropriations or other circumstances, and though it may have passed through ever so many hands. When the matter comes into dispute the descendants of the first family recover their right, and the property must be delivered up.\nOn this occasion the discussion was highly important, for the action was brought against the doge himself, or rather against his wife, who veiled by her zendal, or little hood, sat only at a little distance from the plaintiff. She was a lady of a certain age, of noble stature, and with well-formed features, in which there was something of an earnest, not to say fretful character. The Venetians make it a great boast that the princess in her own palace, is obliged to appear before them and the tribunal.\nWhen the clerk began to read, I for the first time clearly discerned the business of a little man who sat on a low stool behind a small table opposite the judges, and near the advocates. More especially I learned the use of an hour-glass, which was placed before him. As long as the clerk reads, time is not heeded, but the advocate is only allowed a certain time, if he speaks in the course of the reading. The clerk reads, and the hour-glass lies in a horizontal position, with the little man's hand upon it. As soon as the advocate opens his mouth, the glass is raised, and sinks again, as soon as he is silent. It is the great duty of the advocate to make remarks on what is read, to introduce cursory observations in order to excite and challenge attention. This puts the little Saturn in a state of the greatest perplexity. He is obliged every moment to change the horizontal and vertical position of the glass, and finds himself in the situation of the evil spirits in the puppet-show, who by the quickly varying \"Berliche, Berloche\" of the mischievous Hanswurst[4], are puzzled whether they are to come or to go.\nWhoever has heard documents read over in a law-court, can imagine the reading on this occasion,—quick and monotonous, but plain and articulate enough. The ingenious advocate contrives to interrupt the tedium by jests, and the public shows its delight in his jokes by immoderate laughter. I must mention one, the most striking of those I could understand. The reader was just reciting the document, by which, one, who was considered to have been illegally possessed of it, had disposed of the property in question. The advocate bade him lead more slowly, and when he plainly uttered the words: \"I give and bequeath,\" the orator flew violently at the clerk and cried: \"What will you give? What will you bequeath? you poor starved-out devil, nothing in the world belongs to you?\" \"However,\"—he continued, as he seemed to collect himself—\"the illustrious owner was in the same predicament. He wished to give, he wished to bequeath that which belonged to him no more than to you.\" A burst of inextinguishable laughter followed this sally, but the hour-glass at once resumed its horizontal position. The reader went mumbling on, and made a saucy face at the advocate; but all these jokes are prepared beforehand.\n[4]\nAn allusion to the comic scene, in the puppet-play of Faust, from which Göethe took the subject of his poem. One of the two magic words (Berliche, Berloche) summons the devils, the other drives them away, and the Hanswurst (or buffoon), in a mock-incantation scene, perplexes the fiends, by uttering one word after the other, as rapidly as possible.—Trans.\n\nOct. 4.\nI was yesterday at the play, in the theatre of S. Luke, and was highly pleased. I saw a piece acted extempore in masks, with a great deal of nature, energy, and vigour. The actors are not, indeed, all equal; the pantaloon is excellent, and one of the actresses, who is stout and well-built, speaks admirably, and deports herself cleverly, though she is no extraordinary actress. The subject of the piece is extravagant, and resembled that which is treated by us under the name of Der Verschlag (the partition). With inexhaustible variety it amused us for more than three hours. But even here the people is the base upon which everything rests, the spectators are themselves actors, and the multitude is melted into one whole with the stage. All day long the buyer and the seller, the beggar, the sailor, the female gossip, the advocate and his opponent, are living and acting in the square and on the bench, in the gondolas and in the palaces, and make it their business to talk and to asseverate, to cry and to offer for sale, to sing and to play, to curse and to brawl. In the evening they go into the theatre, and see and hear the life of the day artificially put together, prettily set off, interwoven with a story, removed from reality by the masks, and brought near to it by manners. In all this they take a childish delight and again shout and clap, and make a noise. From day to night,—nay, from midnight to midnight, it is always the same.\nI have not often seen more natural acting than that by these masks. It is such acting as can only be sustained by a remarkably happy talent and long practice.\nWhile I am writing this, they are making a tremendous noise on the canal under my window, though it is past midnight. Whether for good or for evil, they are always doing something.\n\nOctober 4.\nI have now heard public orators; viz., three fellows in the square and on the stone-bench, each telling tales after his fashion, two advocates, two preachers, and the actors, among whom I must especially commend the pantaloon. All these have something in common, both because they belong to one and the same nation, which, as it always lives in public, always adopts an impassioned manner of speaking, and because they imitate each other. There is besides a marked language of gesticulations, with which they accompany the expressions of their intentions, views, and feelings.\nThis day was the festival of S. Francis, and I was in his church Alle Vigne. The loud voice of the capuchin was accompanied by the cries of the salesmen in front of the church, as by an antiphone. I stood at the church-door between the two, and the effect was singular enough.\n\nOct. 5.\nThis morning I was in the arsenal, which I found interesting enough, though I know nothing of maritime affairs, and visited the lower school there. It has an appearance like that of an old family, which still bustles about, although its best time of blossom and fruit has passed. By paying attention to the handicraftsmen, I have seen much that is remarkable, and have been on board an eighty-four gun ship, the hull of which is just completed.\nSix months ago a thing of the sort was burned down to the water's edge, off the Riva dei Schiavoni. The powder-room was not very full, and when it blew up, it did no great damage. The windows of the neighbouring houses were destroyed.\nI have seen worked the finest oak from Istria, and have made my observations in return upon this valuable tree. That knowledge of the natural things used by man as materials, and employed for his wants, which I have acquired with so much difficulty, has been incalculably serviceable in explaining to me the proceedings of artists and artisans. The knowledge of mountains and of the stone taken out of them has been to me a great advance in art.\n\nOct. 5.\nTo give a notion of the Bucentaur in one word, I should say that it is a state-galley. The older one, of which we still have drawings, justified this appellation still more than the present one, which, by its splendour makes us forget its original.\nI am always returning to my old opinions. When a genuine subject is given to an artist, his productions will be something genuine also. Here the artist was commissioned to form a galley, worthy to carry the heads of the Republic, on the highest festivals in honour of its ancient rule on the sea; and the problem has been admirably solved. The vessel is all ornament; we ought to say, it is overladen with ornament; it is altogether one piece of gilt carving, for no other use, but that of a pageant to exhibit to the people its leaders in right noble style. We know well enough that a people, who likes to deck out its boats, is no less pleased to see their rulers bravely adorned. This state-galley is a good index to show what the Venetians were, and what they considered themselves.\n\nOct. 5. Night.\nI came home laughing from a tragedy, and must at once make the jest secure upon paper. The piece was not bad, the author had brought together all the tragic matadors, and the actors played well. Most of the situations were well known, but some were new and highly felicitous. There are two fathers, who hate each other, sons and daughters of these severed families, who respectively are passionately in love with each other, and one couple is even privately married. Wild and cruel work goes on, and at last nothing remains to render the young people happy, but to make the two fathers kill each other, upon which the curtain falls amid the liveliest applause. Now the applause becomes more vehement, now \"fuora\" was called out, and this lasted until the two principal couples vouchsafed to crawl forward from behind the curtain, make their bow, and retire at the opposite side.\nThe public was not yet satisfied, but went on clapping and crying: \"i morti!\" till the two dead men also come forward and made their bow, when some voices cried \"bravi i morti!\" The applause detained them for a long time, till at last they were allowed to depart. The effect is infinitely more droll to the eye-and-ear-witness, who, like me, has ringing in his ears the \"bravo! bravi!\" which the Italians have incessantly in their mouths, and then suddenly hears the dead also called forward with this word of honour.\nWe of the north can say \"good night\" at any hour, when we take leave after dark, but the Italian says: \"Felicissima notte\" only once, and that is when the candles are brought into a room. Day and night are thus divided, and something quite different is meant. So impossible is it to translate the idioms of any language! From the highest to the lowest word all has reference to the peculiarities of the natives, in character, opinions, or circumstances.\n\nOct. 6.\nThe tragedy yesterday taught me a great deal. In the first place, I have heard how the Italians treat and declaim their Eleven-syllable iambics, and in the next place, I have understood the tact of Gozzi in combining masks with his tragic personages. This is the proper sort of play for this people, which likes to be moved in a rough fashion. It has no tender, heart-felt sympathy for the unfortunate personage, but is only pleased when the hero speaks well. The Italians attach a great deal of importance to the speaking, and then they like to laugh, or to hear something silly.\nTheir interest in the drama is like that in a real event. When the tyrant gave his son a sword and required him to kill his own wife, who was standing opposite, the people began loudly to express their disapprobation of this demand, and there was a great risk that the piece would have been interrupted. They insisted that the old man should take his sword back, in which case all the subsequent situations in the drama would have been completely spoiled. At last, the distressed son plucked up courage, advanced to the proscenium, and humbly entreated that the audience would have patience for a moment, assuring them that all would turn out to their entire satisfaction. But even judging from an artistical point of view, this situation was, under the circumstances, silly and unnatural, and I commended the people for their feeling.\nI can now better understand the long speeches and the frequent dissertations, pro and con, in the Greek tragedy. The Athenians liked still more to hear speaking, and were still better judges of it, than the Italians. They learned something from the courts of law, where they spent the whole day.\n\nOct. 6.\nIn those works of Palladio, which are completed, I have found much to blame, together with much that is highly valuable. While I was thinking it over in my mind how far I was right or wrong in setting my judgment in opposition to that of so extraordinary a man, I felt as if he stood by and said, \"I did so and so against my will, but, nevertheless, I did it, because in this manner alone was it possible for me, under the given circumstances, to approximate to my highest idea.\" The more I think the matter over, it seems to me, that Palladio, while contemplating the height and width of an already existing church, or of an old house to which he was to attach facades, only considered: \"How will you give the greatest form to these dimensions? Some part of the detail must from the necessity of the case, be put out of its place or spoiled, and something unseemly is sure to arise here and there. Be that as it may, the whole will have a grand style, and you will be pleased with your work.\"\nAnd thus he carried out the great image which he had within his soul, just to the point where it was not quite suitable, and where he was obliged in the detail to mutilate or to overcrowd it.\nOn the other hand, the wing of the Carità cannot be too highly prized, for here the artist's hands were free, and he could follow the bent of his own mind without constraint. If the convent were finished there would, perhaps, be no work of architecture more perfect throughout the present world.\nHow he thought and how he worked becomes more and more clear to me, the more I read his works, and reflect how he treated the ancients; for he says few words, but they are all important. The fourth book, which illustrates the antique temples, is a good introduction to a judicious examination of ancient remains.\n\nOct. 6.\nYesterday evening I saw the Electra of Crebillon—that is to say, a translation—at the theatre S. Crisostomo. I cannot say, how absurd the piece appeared to me, and how terribly it tired me out.\nThe actors are generally good, and know how to put off the public with single passages.\nOrestes alone has three narratives, poetically set off, in one scene. Electra, a pretty little woman of the middle size and stature, with almost French vivacity, and with a good deportment, delivered the verses beautifully, only she acted the part madly from beginning to end, which, alas! it requires. However, I have again learned something. The Italian Iambic, which is invariably of eleven syllables, is very inconvenient for declamation, because the last syllable is always short, and causes an elevation of the voice against the will of the declaimer.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis morning I was present at high mass, which annually on this day the Doge must attend, in the church of St. Justina, to commemorate an old victory over the Turks. When the gilded barks, which carry the princes and a portion of the nobility approach the little square, when the boatmen, in their rare liveries, are plying their red-painted oars, when on the shore the clergy and the religious fraternities are standing, pushing, moving about, and waiting with their lighted torches fixed upon poles and portable silver chandeliers; then, when the gangways covered with carpet are placed from the vessels to the shore, and first the full violet dresses of the Savii, next the ample red robes of the Senators are unfolded upon the pavement, and lastly when the old Doge adorned with his golden Phrygian cap, in his long golden talar and his ermine cloak, steps out of the vessel—when all this, I say, takes place in a little square before the portal of a church, one feels as if one were looking at an old worked tapestry, exceedingly well designed and coloured. To me, northern fugitive as I am, this ceremony gave a great deal of pleasure. With us, who parade nothing but short coats in our processions of pomp, and who conceive nothing greater than one performed with shouldered arms, such an affair might be out of place. But these trains, these peaceful celebrations are all in keeping here.\nThe Doge is a well-grown and well-shaped man, who, perhaps, suffers from ill health, but, nevertheless, for dignity's sake, bears himself upright under his heavy robe. In other respects he looks like the grandpapa of the whole race, and is kind and affable. His dress is very becoming, the little cap, which he wears under the large one, does not offend the eye, resting as it does upon the whitest and finest hair in the world.\nAbout fifty nobili, with long dark-red trains, were with him. For the most part they were handsome men, and there was not a single uncouth figure among them. Several of them were tall with large heads, so that the white curly wigs were very becoming to them. Their features are prominent; the flesh of their faces is soft and white, without looking flabby and disagreeable. On the contrary, there is an appearance of talent without exertion, repose, self-confidence, easiness of existence, and a certain joyousness-pervades the whole.\nWhen all had taken their places in the church, and mass began, the fraternities entered by the chief door, and went out at the side door to the right, after they had received holy water in couples, and made their obeisance to the high altar, to the Doge, and the nobility.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis evening I bespoke the celebrated song of the mariners, who chaunt Tasso and Ariosto to melodies of their own. This must actually be ordered, as it is not to be beard as a thing, of course, but rather belongs to the half forgotten traditions of former times. I entered a gondola by moon-light, with one singer before and the other behind me. They sing their song taking up the verses alternately. The melody, which we know through Rousseau, is of a middle kind, between choral and recitative, maintaining throughout the same cadence, with out any fixed time. The modulation is also uniform, only varying with a sort of declamation both tone and measure, according to the subject of the verse. But the spirit—the life of it, is as follows:—\nWithout inquiring into the construction of the melody, suffice it to say that it is admirably suited to that easy class of people, who, always humming something or other to themselves, adapt such tunes to any little poem they know by heart.\nSitting on the shore of an island, on the bank of a canal, or on the side of a boat, a gondolier will sing away with a loud penetrating voice—the multitude admire force above everything—anxious only to be heard as far as possible. Over the silent mirror it travels far. Another in the distance, who is acquainted with the melody and knows the words, takes it up and answers with the next verse, and then the first replies, so that the one is as it were the echo of the other. The song continues through whole nights and is kept up without fatigue. The further the singers are from each other, the more touching sounds the strain. The best place for the listener is halfway between the two.\nIn order to let me hear it, they landed on the bank of the Guidecca, and took up different positions by the canal. I walked backwards and forwards between them, so as to leave the one whose turn it was to sing, and to join the one who had just left off. Then it was that the effect of the strain first opened upon me. As a voice from the distance it sounds in the highest degree strange—as a lament without sadness: it has an incredible effect and is moving even to tears. I ascribed this to my own state of mind, but my old boatsman said: \"è singolare, como quel canto intenerisce, e molto piu quando è piu ben cantato.\" He wished that I could hear the women of the Lido, especially those of Malamocco, and Pelestrina. These also, he told me, chanted Tasso and Ariosto to the same or similar melodies. He went on: \"in the evening, while their husbands are on the sea fishing, they are accustomed to sit on the beach, and with shrill-penetrating voice to make these strains resound, until they catch from the distance the voices of their partners, and in this way they keep up a communication with them.\" Is not that beautiful? and yet, it is very possible that one who heard them close by, would take little pleasure in such tones which have to vie with the waves of the sea. Human, however, and true becomes the song in this way: thus is life given to the melody, on whose dead elements we should otherwise have been sadly puzzled. It is the song of one solitary, singing at a distance, in the hope that another of kindred feelings and sentiments may hear and answer.\n\nVenice, Oct. 8, 1786.\nI paid a visit to the palace Pisani Moretta, for the sake of a charming picture by Paul Veronese. The females of the family of Darius are represented kneeling before Alexander and Hephæstion; his mother, who is in the foreground, mistakes Hephæstion for the king;—turning away from her he points to Alexander. A strange story is told about this painting; the artist had been well received and for a long time honorably entertained in the palace; in return he secretly painted the picture and left it behind him as a present, rolled up under his bed. Certainly it well deserves to have had a singular origin, for it gives an idea of all the peculiar merits of this master. The great art with which he manages by a skilful distribution of light and shade, and by an equally clever contrast of the local colors, to produce a most delightful harmony without throwing any sameness of tone over the whole picture, is here most strikingly visible. For the picture is in excellent preservation, and stands before us almost with the freshness of yesterday.—Indeed, whenever a painting of this order has suffered from neglect, our enjoyment of it is marred on the spot, even before we are conscious what the cause may be.\nWhoever feels disposed to quarrel with the artist on the score of costume has only to say he ought to have painted a scene of the sixteenth century; and the matter is at an end. The gradation in the expression from the mother through the wife to the daughters, is in the highest degree true and happy. The youngest princess, who kneels behind all the rest, is a beautiful girl, and has a very pretty, but somewhat independent and haughty countenance. Her position does not at all seem to please her.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nMy old gift of seeing the world with the eyes of that artist, whose pictures have most recently made an impression on me, has occasioned me some peculiar reflections. It is evident that the eye forms itself by the objects, which, from youth up, it is accustomed to look upon, and so the Venetian artist must see all things in a clearer and brighter light than other men. We, whose eye when out of doors, falls on a dingy soil, which, when not muddy, is dusty,—and which, always colourless, gives a sombre hue to the reflected rays, or at home spend our lives in close, narrow rooms, can never attain to such a cheerful view of nature.\nAs I floated down the lagunes in the full sunshine, and observed how the figures of the gondoliers in their motley costume, and as they rowed, lightly moving above the sides of the gondola, stood out from the bright green surface and against the blue sky, I caught the best and freshest type possible of the Venetian school. The sunshine brought out the local colours with dazzling brilliancy, and the shades even were so luminous, that, comparatively, they in their turn might serve as lights. And the same may be said of the reflection from the sea-green water. All was painted \"chiaro nell chiaro,\" so that foamy waves and lightning flashes were necessary to give it a grand finish (um die Tüpfchen auf sie zu setzen).\nTitian and Paul have this brilliancy in the highest degree, and whenever we do not find it in any of their works, the piece is either damaged or has been touched up.\nThe cupola and vaulting of St. Mark's, with its side-walls,—are covered with paintings—a mass of richly colored figures on a golden ground; all in mosaic work: some of them very good, others but poor, according to the masters who furnished the cartoons.\nCircumstances here have strangely impressed on my mind how everything depends on the first invention, and that this constitutes the right standard—the true genius—since with little square-pieces of glass (and here not in the soberest manner), it is possible to imitate the good as well as the bad. The art which furnished to the ancients their pavements, and to the Christians the vaulted ceilings of their churches, fritters itself away in our days on snuff-box lids and bracelets-clasps. The present times are worse even than one thinks.\n\nVenice, October 8, 1786.\nIn the Farsetti palace there is a valuable collection of casts from the best antiques. I pass over all such as I had seen before at Mannheim or elsewhere, and mention only new acquaintances. A Cleopatra in intense repose, with the asp coiled round her arm, and sinking into the sleep of death;—a Niobe shrouding with her robe her youngest daughter from the arrows of Apollo;—some gladiators;—a winged genius, resting in his flight;—some philosophers, both in sitting and standing postures.\nThey are works from which, for thousands of years to come, the world may receive delight and instruction, without ever being able to equal with their thanks the merits of the artists.\nMany speaking busts transported me to the old glorious times. Only I felt, alas, how backward I am in these studies; however, I will go on with them—at least I know the way. Palladio has opened the road for me to this and every other art and life. That sounds probably somewhat strange, and yet not so paradoxical as when Jacob Böhme says that, by seeing a pewter platter by a ray from Jupiter, he was enlightened as to the whole universe. There is also in this collection a fragment of the entablature of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina in Rome.\nThe bold front of this noble piece of architecture reminded me of the capitol of the Pantheon at Mannheim. It is, indeed, something very different from our queer saints, piled up one above the other on little consoles after the gothic style of decoration,—something different from our tobacco-pipe-like shafts,—our little steeple-crowned towers, and foliated terminals,—from all taste for these—I am now, thank God, set free for ever!\nI will further mention a few works of statuary, which, as I passed along these last few days, I have observed with astonishment and instruction: before the gate of the arsenal two huge lions of white marble,-the one is half recumbent, raising himself up on his fore-feet,—the other is lying down: noble emblems of the variety of life. They are of such huge proportions, that all around appears little, and man himself would become as nought, did not sublime objects elevate him. They are of the best times of Greece, and were brought here from the Piraeus in the better days of the Republic.\nFrom Athens, too, in all probability, came two bas-reliefs which have been introduced in the church of St. Justina, the conqueress of the Turks. Unfortunately they are in some degree hidden by the church seats. The sacristan called my attention to them on account of the tradition that Titian, modelled from them the beautiful angel in his picture of the martyrdom of St. Peter. The relievos represent genii who are decking themselves out with, the attributes of the gods,—so beautiful in truth, as to transcend all idea or conception.\nNext I contemplated with quite peculiar feelings the naked colossal statue of Marcus Agrippa, in the court of a palace; a dolphin which is twisting itself by his side, points out the naval hero. How does such a heroic representation make the mere man equal to the gods!\nI took a close view of the horses of S. Mark's. Looking up at them from below, it is easy to see that they are spotted: in places they exhibit a beautiful yellow-metallic lustre, in others a coppery green has run over them. Viewing them more closely, one sees distinctly that once they were gilt all over, and long streaks are still to be seen over them, as the barbarians did not attempt to file off the gold, but tried to cut it off. That, too, is well: thus the shape at least has been preserved.\nA glorious team of horses,—I should like to hear the opinion of a good judge of horse-flesh. What seemed strange to me was, that closely viewed, they appear heavy, while from the piazza below they look as light as deer.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nYesterday I set out early with my tutelary genius for the \"Lido,\" the tongue of land which shuts in the lagunes, and divides them from the sea. We landed and walked straight across the isthmus. I heard a loud hollow murmur,—it was the sea! I soon saw it: it crested high against the shore, as it retired,—it was about noon, and time of ebb. I have then at last seen the sea with my own eyes, and followed it on its beautiful bed, just as it quitted it. I wished the children had been there to gather the shells; child-like I myself picked up plenty of them; however, I attempted to make them useful; I tried to dry in them some of the fluid of the cuttle fish, which here dart away from you in shoals.\nOn the \"Lido,\" not far from the sea, is the burial place of Englishmen, and a little further on, of the Jews: both alike are refused the privilege of resting in consecrated ground. I found here the tomb of Smith, the noble English consul, and of his first wife. It is to him that I owe my first copy of Palladio; I thanked him for it here in his unconsecrated grave. And not only unconsecrated, but half buried is the tomb. The \"Lido\" is at best but a sand-bank (daune): The sand is carried from it backwards and forwards by the wind, and thrown up in heaps is encroaching on every side. In a short time the monument, which is tolerably high, will no longer be visible.\nBut the sea—it is a grand sight! I will try and get a sail upon it some day in a fishing-boat: the gondolas never venture out so far.\n\nOct. 8, 1786.\nOn the sea-coast I found also several plants, whose characters similar to others I already knew, enabled me to recognize pretty well their properties. They are all alike, fat and strong-full of sap and clammy,—and it is evident that the old salt of the sandy soil, but still more the saline atmosphere, gives them these properties. Like aquatic plants they abound in sap, and are fleshy and tough, like mountainous ones; those whose leaves shew a tendency to put forth prickles, after the manner of thistles, have them extremely sharp and strong. I found a bush with leaves of this kind. It looked very much like our harmless coltsfoot, only here it is armed with sharp weapons,—the leaves like leather, as also are the seed-vessels, and the stalk very thick and succulent. I bring with me seeds and specimens of the leaves. (Eryngium maritimum.)\nThe fish-market, with its numberless marine productions, afforded me much amusement. I often go there to contemplate the poor captive inhabitants of the sea.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nA delicious day from morning to night! I have been towards Chiozza, as far as Pelestrina, where are the great structures, called Murazzi, which the Republic has caused to be raised against the sea. They are of hewn stone, and properly are intended to protect from the fury of the wild element the tongue of land called the Lido, which separates the lagoons from the sea.\nThe lagunes are the work of old nature. First of all, the land and tide, the ebb and flow, working against one another, and then the gradual sinking of the primal waters, were, together, the causes why, at the upper end of the Adriatic, we find a pretty extensive range of marshes, which, covered by the flood-tide, are partly left bare by the ebb. Art took possession of the highest spots, and thus arose Venice, formed out of a groupe of a hundred isles, and surrounded by hundreds more. Moreover, at an incredible expense of money and labour, deep canals have been dug through the marshes, in order that at the time of high water, ships of war might pass to the chief points. What human industry and wit contrived and executed of old, skill and industry must now keep up. The Lido, a long narrow strip of land, separates the lagunes from the sea, which can enter only at two points—at the castle and at the opposite end near Chiozza. The tide flows in usually twice a-day, and with the ebb again carries out the waters twice, and always by the same channel and in the same direction. The flood covers the lower parts of the morass, but leaves the higher, if not dry, yet visible.\nThe case would be quite altered were the sea to make new ways for itself, to attack the tongue of land and flow in and out wherever it chose. Not to mention that the little villages on the Lido, Pelestrina, viz., S. Peter's and others would be overwhelmed, the canals of communication would be choked up, and while the water involved all in ruin, the Lido would be changed into an island, and the islands which now lie behind it be converted into necks and tongues of land. To guard against this it was necessary to protect the Lido as far as possible, lest the furious element should capriciously attack and overthrow what man had already taken possession of, and with a certain end and purpose given shape and use to.\nIn extraordinary cases when the sea rises above measure, it is especially necessary to prevent it entering at more than two points. Accordingly the rest of the sluice-gates being shut, with all its violence it is unable to enter, and in a few hours submits to the law of the ebb, and its fury lessens.\nOtherwise Venice has nothing to fear; the extreme slowness with which the sea-line retires, assures to her thousands of years yet, and by prudently deepening the canals from time to time, they will easily maintain their possessions against the inroads of the water.\nI could only wish that they kept their streets a little cleaner—a duty which is as necessary as it is easy of performance, and which in fact becomes of great consequence in the course of centuries. Even now in the principal thoroughfares it is forbidden to throw anything into the canals: the sweepings even of the streets may not be cast into them. No measures, however, are taken to prevent the rain, which here falls in sudden and violent torrents, from carrying off the dirt which is collected in piles at the corner of every street, and washing it into the lagunes—nay, what is still worse, into the gutters for carrying off the water, which consequently are often so completely stopped up, that the principal squares are in danger of being under water. Even in the smaller piazza of S. Mark's, I have seen the gullies which are well laid down there, as well as in the greater square, choked up and full of water.\nWhen a rainy day comes, the filth is intolerable; every one is cursing and scolding. In ascending and descending the bridges one soils one's mantle and great coat (Tabarro), which is here worn all the year long, and as one goes along in shoes and silk stockings, one gets splashed, and then scolds, for it is not common mud, but mud that adheres and stains that one is here splashed with. The weather soon becomes fine again, and then no one thinks of cleaning the streets. How true is the saying: the public is ever complaining that is ill served, and never knows how to set about getting better served. Here if the sovereign-people wished it, it might be done forthwith.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nYesterday evening I ascended the tower of S. Mark's: as I had lately seen from its top the lagunes in their glory at flood time, I wished also to see them at low water; for in order to have a correct idea of the place, it is necessary to take in both views. It looks rather strange to see land all around one, where a little before the eye fell upon a mirror of waters. The islands are no longer islands—merely higher and house-crowned spots in one large morass of a gray-greenish colour, and intersected by beautiful canals. The marshy parts are overgrown with aquatic plants, a circumstance which must tend in time to raise their level, although the ebb and flow are continually shaking and tossing them and leave no rest to the vegetation.\nI now turn with my narrative once more to the sea.—I there saw yesterday the haunts of the sea-snails, the limpets, and the crab, and was highly delighted with the sight. What a precious glorious object is a living thing!—how wonderfully adapted to its state of existence, how true, how real (seyend). What great advantages do I not derive now from my former studies of nature, and how delighted am I with the opportunity of continuing them! But as the present is a matter that admits of being communicated to my friends, I will not seek to excite their sympathy merely by exclamations.\nThe stone-works which have been built against the inroads of the sea consist first of all of several steep steps; then comes a slightly inclined plane, then again they rise a step, which is once more succeeded by a gently ascending surface, and last of all comes a perpendicular wall with an overhanging coping—over these steps—over these planes the raging sea rises until in extraordinary cases it even dashes over the highest wall with its projecting head.\nThe sea is followed by its inhabitants;—little periwinkles good to eat, monovalve limpets, and whatever else has the power of motion, especially by the pungar-crabs. But scarcely have these little creatures taken possession of the smooth walls, ere the sea retires again, swelling and cresting as it came. At first the crowd knows not where they are, and keep hoping that the briny flood will soon return to them—but it still keeps away; the sun comes out and quickly dries them up, and now begins the retreat. It is on these occasions that the pungars seek their prey. Nothing more wonderful or comical can be seen than the manœuvres of these little creatures, with their round bodies and two long claws (for the other spider-feet are scarcely worth noticing). On these stilted fore-legs, as it were, they stride along watching the limpets, and as soon as one moves itself under its shell on the rock, a pungar comes up and inserting the point of his claw in the tiny interstice between the shell and the rock turns it over, and so manages to swallow the oyster. The limpets, on the other hand, proceed cautiously on their way, and by suction fasten themselves firmly to the rocky surface as soon as they are aware of the proximity of their foe. In such cases the pungar deports himself amusingly enough; round and round the pulpy animal who keeps himself safe beneath his roof will he go with singular politeness; but not succeeding with all his coaxing and being unable to overcome its powerful muscle, he leaves in despair this intended victim, and hastens after another who may be wandering less cautiously on his way.\nI never saw a crab succeed in his designs, although I have watched for hours the retreat of the little troop as they crawled down the two planes and the intermediate steps.\n\nVenice, Oct. 10, 1786.\nAt last I am able to say that I have seen a comedy; Yesterday at the theatre of St. Luke, was performed \"Le Baruffe-Chiozotte,\" which I should interpret the Frays and Feuds of Chiozza. The \"dramatis personæ,\" are principally seafaring people, inhabitants of Chiozza, with their wives, sisters, and daughters. The usual noisy demonstrations of such sort of people in their good or ill luck—their dealings one with another, their vehemence, but goodness of heart, common-place remarks and unaffected manners, their naïve wit and humour—all this was excellently imitated. The piece, moreover, is Goldoni's, and as I had been only the day before in the place itself, and as the tones and manners of the sailors and people of the sea-port still echoed in my ears and floated before my eyes, it delighted me very much, and although I did not understand a single allusion, I was, nevertheless, on the whole, able to follow it pretty well. I will now give you the plan of the piece:—it opens with the females of Chiozza sitting, as usual, on the strand before their cabins, spinning, mending nets, sewing, or making lace; a youth passes by and notices one of them with a more friendly greeting than the rest. Immediately the joking begins—and observes no bounds; becoming tarter and tarter, and growing ill-tempered it soon bursts out into reproaches; abuse vies with abuse; in the midst of all one dame more vehement than the rest, bounces out with the truth; and now an endless din of scolding, railing, and screaming; there is no lack of more decided outrage, and at last the peace-officers are compelled to interfere.\nThe second act opens with the Court of Justice. In the absence of the Podestà (who as a noble could not lawfully be brought upon the stage) the Actuarius presides. He orders the women to be brought before him one by one. This gives rise to an interesting scene. It happens that this official personage is himself enamoured of the first of the combatants who is brought before him. Only too happy to have an opportunity of speaking with her alone, instead of hearing what she has to say on the matter in question, he makes her a declaration of love. In the midst of it a second woman, who is herself in love with the actuary, in a fit of jealousy rushes in, and with her the suspicious lover of the first damsel—who is followed by all the rest, and now the same demon of confusion riots in the court as a little before, had set at loggerheads the people of the harbour. In the third act the fun gets more and more boisterous, and the whole ends with a hasty and poor denouement. The happiest thought, however, of the whole piece, is a character who is thus drawn,—an old sailor who from the hardships he has been exposed to from his childhood, trembles and falters in all his limbs, and even in his very organs of speech, is brought on the scene to serve as a foil to this restless, screaming, and jabbering crew. Before he can utter a word, he has to make a long preparation by a slow twitching of his lips, and an assistant motion of his hands and arms; at last he blurts out what his thoughts are on the matter in dispute. But as he can only manage to do this in very short sentences, he acquires thereby a sort of laconic gravity, so that all he utters sounds like an adage or maxim; and in this way a happy contrast is afforded to the wild and passionate exclamations of the other personages.\nBut even as it was, I never witnessed anything like the noisy delight the people evinced at seeing themselves and their mates represented with such truth of nature. It was one continued laugh and tumultuous shout of exultation from beginning to end. I must, however, confess that the piece was extremely well acted by the players. According to the cast of their several parts, they had adopted among them the different tones of voice which usually prevail among the inhabitants of the place. The first actress was the universal favorite, more so even than she had recently been in an heroic dress and a scene of passion. The female players generally, but especially this one, in the most pleasing manner possible imitated the twang, the manners, and other peculiarities of the people they represented. Great praise is due to the author, who out of nothing has here created the most amusing divertissement. However, he never could have done it with any other people than his own merry and lighthearted countrymen. The farce is written throughout with a practised hand.\nOf Sacchi's company, for whom Gozzi wrote (but which by-the-by is now broken up), I saw Smeraldina, a short plump figure, full of life, tact, and good humour. With her I saw Brighella—a slight well-made man and an excellent actor, especially in pantomime. These masks which we scarcely know except in the form of mummings, and which to our minds possess neither life nor meaning, succeed here only too well as the creation of the national taste. Here the most distinguished characters, persons of every age and condition, think nothing of dressing themselves out in the strangest costumes, and as for the greater part of the year they are accustomed to wander about in masks, they feel no surprise at seeing the black visors on the stage also.\n\nVenice, October 11, 1786.\nSince solitude, in the midst of a great crowd of human beings, is after all not possible, I have taken up with an old Frenchman, who knows nothing of Italian, and suspects that he is cheated on all hands and taken advantage of, and who, with plenty of letters of recommendation, nevertheless, does not make his way with the good people here. A man of rank, and living in good style, but one whose mind cannot go beyond himself and his own immediate circle—he is perhaps full fifty, and has at home a boy seven years old, of whom he is always anxious to get news. He is travelling through Italy for pleasure, but rapidly—in order to be able to say that he has seen it, but is willing to learn whatever is possible as he hurries along. I have shewn him some civilities, and have given him information about many matters. While I was speaking to him about Venice, he asked me how long I had been here, and when he heard that this was my first visit, and that I had only been here fourteen days, he replied: \"Il paraît que vous n'avez pas perdu votre temps.\" This is the first \"testimonium\" of my good behaviour that I can furnish you. This is the eighth day since he arrived here, and he leaves us to-morrow. It was highly delicious to me, to meet in a strange land with such a regular Versailles'-man. He is now about to quit me! It caused me some surprise to think that any one could ever travel in this temper without a thought for anything beyond himself, and yet he is in his way a polished, sensible, and well conducted person.\n\nVenice, Oct. 12, 1786.\nYesterday at S. Luke's a new piece was acted:—L'Inglicismo in Italia (the English in Italy). As there are many Englishmen living in Italy, it is not unnatural that their ways and habits should excite notice, and I expected to learn from this piece what the Italians thought of their rich and welcome visitors. But it was a total failure. There were, of course, (as is always the case here,) some clever scenes between buffoons, but the rest was cast altogether in too grave and heavy a mould, and yet nob a trace of the English good sense: plenty of the ordinary Italian commonplaces of morality, and those, too, upon the very commonest of topics.\nAnd it did not take: indeed, it was on the very point of being hissed off the stage. The actors felt themselves out of their element—not on the strand of Chiozza. As this was the last piece that I saw here, my enthusiasm for these national representations did not seem likely to be increased by this piece of folly.\nAs I have at last gone through my journal and entered some occasional remarks from my tablets, my proceedings are now enrolled and left to the sentence of my friends. There is, I am conscious, very much in these leaves which I might qualify, enlarge upon, and improve. Let, however, what is written, stand as the memorial of first impressions, which, if not always correct, will nevertheless be ever dear and precious to me. Oh that I could but transmit to my friends a breath merely of this light existence! Verily to the Italian, \"ultramontane\" is a very vague idea; and to me even—\"beyond the Alps,\" rises very obscurely before my mind, although from out of their mists friendly forms are beckoning to me. It is the climate only that seduces me to prefer awhile these lands to those; for birth and habit forge strong fetters. Here, however, I could not live, nor indeed in any place where I had nothing to occupy my mind; but at present novelty furnishes me here with endless occupation. Architecture rises, like an ancient spirit from the tombs, and bids me study its laws just as people do the rules of a dead language, not in order to practise or to take a living joy in them, but only in order to enable myself in the quiet depths of my own mind to do honor to her existence in bygone ages, and her for ever departed glory. As Palladio everywhere refers one to Vitruvius, I have bought an edition of the latter by Galiani; but this folio suffers in my portmanteau as much as my brain does in the study of it. Palladio by his words and works, by his method and way, both of thinking and of executing, has brought Vitruvius home to me and interpreted him far better than the Italian translator ever can. Vitruvius himself is no easy reading; his book is obscurely written, and requires a critical study. Notwithstanding I have read it through cursorily, and it has left on my mind many a glorious impression. To express my meaning better: I read it like a breviary: more out of devotion, than for instruction. Already the days begin to draw in and allow more time for reading and writing.\nGod be praised! whatever from my youth up appeared to me of worth, is beginning once more to be dear to me. How happy do I feel that I can again venture to approach the ancient authors. For now, I may dare tell it—and confess at once my disease and my folly. For many a long year I could not bear to look at a Latin author, or to cast my eye upon anything that might serve to awaken in my mind the thoughts of Italy. If by accident I did so, I suffered the most horrible tortures of mind. It was a frequent joke of Herder's at my expense, that I had learned all my Latin from Spinoza, for he had noticed that this was the only Latin work I ever read; but he was not aware how carefully I was obliged to keep myself from the ancients—how even these abstruse generalities were but cursorily read by me, and even then not without pain. At last matters came to that pitch that even the perusal of Wieland's translation of the Satires made me utterly wretched; scarcely had I read two of them, before I was compelled to lay the book aside.\nHad I not made the resolve, which I am now carrying into effect, I should have been altogether lost—to such a degree of intensity had the desire grown to see these objects with my own eyes. Historical acquaintance with them did me no good;—the things stood only a hand's-breadth away from me; but still they were separated from me by an impenetrable wall. And, in fact, at the present moment, I somehow feel as if this were not the first time that I had seen these things, but as if I were paying a second visit to them. Although I have been but a short time in Venice, I have adapted myself pretty well to the ways of the place, and feel confident that I shall carry away with me, though a very incomplete, yet, nevertheless, clear and true idea of it.\n\nVenice, Oct. 14, 1786. 2 o'clock, morning.\nIn the last moments of my stay here: for I am to start almost immediately with the packet-boat for Ferrara. I quit Venice without reluctance; for to stay here longer with any satisfaction and profit to myself, I must take other steps which would carry me beyond my present plan. Besides everybody is now leaving this city and making for the beautiful gardens and seats on the Terra-Firma; I, however, go away well-loaded, and shall carry along with me its rich, rare, and unique image.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 page story in english that enhances the event contained in:[EVENT_Goethe], keep everything already present and build around it.

      "content": "October 3.\n\nThe gondola cut through the choppy waters of the Giudecca Canal, the autumnal sirocco, which had chased me across Lake Garda days earlier, now whipped at the lagoon with a blustery insistence. The usually placid surface was a restless mirror, reflecting the grand Palladian façade of Il Redentore in shimmering, broken light. Each wave that slapped against the gondola’s hull seemed to echo the rhythmic lapping against the church's famed seventeen steps, which Volkmann had so meticulously counted. I steadied myself, my gaze fixed on the island, feeling the physical dynamism of the water beneath me, making the contemplation of static architecture a precarious, vibrant dance.\n\nPalladio, that master of ancient forms, had sought to reconcile the severe beauty of the Roman temple with the needs of a Christian basilica. I had studied his books, and the theory of interlocking pediments, the way the higher central nave was embraced by the lower side aisles, was a triumph of intellect. Here, in Il Redentore, one could witness the absolute success of his vision. The façade, a symphony of white and geometric planes, offered a serene resolution to a problem that had plagued architects for centuries. It possessed a harmony that spoke to the soul, a quiet majesty that outshone even the grander, yet somehow less resolved, San Giorgio, whose central columns, perched on high pedestals, always seemed to me to stand on stilts, creating a jarring visual rupture. Volkmann, in his dry enumeration, could never capture this subtle, yet profound, distinction. He noted facts, but missed the very essence of the artistic solution.\n\nAs we neared the steps, I observed a detail that further deepened my understanding of Venetian artifice. The immaculate whiteness, which from a distance suggested noble stone, revealed itself upon closer inspection. Only the Corinthian capitals and the bases of the columns, along with the keystones of the arches, were of hewn stone. The rest, astonishingly, was but burnt clay, expertly stuccoed and whitewashed to mimic marble. Even the frieze and cornice, which appeared so solid, were mere terracotta. It was a city built on illusion, a grand theatre set where brick played the part of eternal stone, held together not by mass, but by the sheer genius of proportion. This revelation, though surprising, did not diminish my admiration; rather, it added a layer of ingenious vulnerability to the structure, a testament to what a declining republic, with more ambition than ready funds, could still achieve.\n\nStepping into the cool interior of Il Redentore, the grand scale of Palladio's design enveloped me. The air, though damp from the lagoon, was thick with the sweet, cloying scent of incense, mingling faintly with the fresh, earthy smell of cypress and aromatic herbs carried from the Capuchin garden behind the church. Today, October 3rd, marked the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi, and the Capuchin Friars Minor, humble in their brown habits, were bustling with preparatory activity. My gaze was drawn to a side altar, \"splendidly adorned\" in honor of the saint. It was a jarring contrast to the austere classical lines of the nave. Here, amid Palladio’s rational light and Corinthian columns, erupted an explosion of devout, albeit aesthetically questionable, Baroque exuberance.\n\nThe altar glittered with what appeared to be a rich, arabesque embroidery, broad tendrils and foliage intricately worked in gold. I approached, intrigued by the sheer volume of this lavish display. But as I drew nearer, the ingenious deception became apparent. The \"gold\" was, in fact, straw, pressed flat and meticulously glued onto paper, following intricate outlines, the background painted with vibrant, lively colors. Cardboard figures, flat and painted, filled the niches that Palladio had surely intended for noble stone statues. It was a powerful display of \"Arte Povera,\" a testament to the Capuchins' ingenuity and their dedication to St. Francis, using materials of no intrinsic worth to create an effect that, had it been genuine, would have cost a fortune. I found myself caught between a neoclassical disdain for such \"bad taste\" and a grudging respect for the artisanal skill and heartfelt devotion it represented. It was a tangible expression of Venetian illusion, not in grand architecture, but in humble piety.\n\nHaving absorbed the silent, fragrant devotion of the Giudecca, I sought the vibrant pulse of the city. My gondola deposited me near the Riva degli Schiavoni, a quay teeming with life and noise. The air here was a cacophony of vendors' cries, the clatter of wooden shoes on stone, and the ceaseless chatter of a thousand tongues. The sharp, briny scent of the lagoon mingled with the rich aroma of roasted chestnuts, the oily tang of fried fish sold from makeshift stalls, and the distant, acrid smell of caulking tar. This was the true Venice, a swirling eddy of humanity, far removed from the architectural ideals of Palladio or the scholarly musings of Volkmann.\n\nMy attention was soon captured by a small gathering on the quay, a knot of the \"lowest class,\" as I noted, encircling a \"little fellow\" who was gesticulating wildly. He was an improvisatore, a street storyteller, a direct descendant of the Commedia dell'arte tradition that Goldoni had both celebrated and sought to refine. He stood not on a stage, but on an overturned crate, his hands painting vivid pictures in the air as his voice rose and fell in the musical cadence of the Venetian dialect. I strained to catch a word, but it was useless; the rapid-fire patois, so distinct from the Tuscan Italian I grasped, was an impenetrable wall.\n\nYet, I found myself captivated by the scene. The audience, though composed of the working poor, did not laugh uproariously as one might expect from such street entertainment. Instead, they occasionally smiled, a knowing, appreciative curve of the lips that spoke volumes. The storyteller himself, far from being a buffoon, possessed a remarkable dignity. His appearance was sedate, almost humble, but his gestures were a masterclass in precision and variety, each movement deliberate, reflecting an innate theatricality and a deep understanding of his craft. He was recounting, I surmised, some ancient legend, perhaps a mythologized tale of Venetian triumph or a ribald anecdote from the city's colourful past. Here was history not written in dry chronicles, but breathed into life with passion and dialect, shaping the collective memory of the people. It was a living, breathing testament to the oral tradition, far removed from the learned pages of Volkmann, yet perhaps closer to the true spirit of the city.\n\nAs evening descended, painting the sky in hues of deep orange and purple, I consulted my plan, navigating the labyrinthine alleys and narrow bridges towards the church of the Mendicanti. The journey itself was a stark contrast to the open expanse of the Riva. Here, the houses loomed tall, almost touching overhead, creating a sense of intimate enclosure, a world of whispers and hidden passages. The air grew cooler, and the sounds of the street receded, replaced by the distant tolling of bells and the soft lapping of water against stone.\n\nThe church of the Mendicanti, one of Venice's renowned *Ospedali Grandi*, housed a conservatorio of the highest repute, famous for its *figlie di coro* – the orphaned girls trained to astonishing musical virtuosity. The church was already filled with an expectant audience, a hushed reverence settling over the crowd as the hour approached. The music began, a cascade of voices descending from above, ethereal and pure. The performers remained unseen, or at least partially obscured, behind a magnificent, ornate metal grating in the gallery, a physical barrier that only heightened the mystique of their artistry.\n\nThe oratorio, I learned, was \"Saul,\" by Ferdinando Bertoni, a work sung in Latin, yet imbued with a \"dulcified pronunciation,\" so Italianized in places that it provoked a silent, amused smile. The music was indeed beautiful, the voices magnificent, weaving intricate harmonies. Then, a solo. An alto voice, astonishing in its depth and power, took on the role of King Saul, the tragic biblical monarch. I had never conceived of such a voice, a \"strange, neutral thing\" that transcended gender, embodying the masculine fury and despair with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. Some passages were excessively beautiful, perfectly adapted for singing, showcasing the wide field music enjoyed in this city.\n\nMy enjoyment, however, was destined to be marred. A sudden, sharp *clack-clack-clack* echoed through the church, jarring and intrusive. It was the \"accursed Maestro di Capella,\" beating time with a rolled-up sheet of music against the metal grating, as conspicuously as if he were chastising a room full of unruly schoolboys. The noise was utterly unnecessary; the girls, I presumed, had rehearsed this piece countless times, their performance already flawless. This impudent clatter shattered the delicate illusion, a crude intrusion of the mundane into the sublime. It was as if, to make a beautiful statue more intelligible, one were to stick scarlet patches on its joints. The foreign, mechanical sound destroyed all harmony. Could this man, a musician himself, truly be insensible to such an impropriety? Or did he, perhaps, choose to assert his presence, his authority, through this jarring interruption, rather than allowing his value to be perceived through the perfection of the execution? It was a peculiar fault, one I had attributed to the French, but now found in the Italians, and the public, it seemed, was entirely accustomed to it. It was not the first time, I reflected, that that which spoils enjoyment was mistakenly assumed to be an integral part of it. This city, with its stuccoed bricks, its straw embroidery, and its unseen female voices, continued to reveal its layers of artifice and reality, a constant interplay between the ideal and the imperfect.",

Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

It comes from Goethe's \"Letters from Switzerland and Travels in Italy\". Please bridge the gaps between the events that Goethe describes in a plausible way.\nOct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n\n\n--- [ID: 9a45d928-7a4d-46a4-98e5-ac00a3a153b6] WHOLE_TRAVEL_STORY_Goethe ---\n[HOW TO USE]: Here is the full chapter \"From Verona to Venice\" of Goethe's \"Letters from Switzerland and Travels in Italy\". It contains his whole travel story to Venice. The content of the augmented event must respect the broader context of Goethe's travel story.\nFROM VERONA TO VENICE.\nVerona, Sept. 16th.\nWell then, the amphitheatre is the first important monument of the old times that I have seen—and how well it is preserved! When I entered, and still more when I walked round the edge of it at the top, it seemed strange to me, that I saw something great, and yet, properly speaking, saw nothing. Besides I do not like to see it empty, I should like to see it full of people, just as, in modern times, it was filled up in honour of Joseph I. and Pius VI. The Emperor, although his eye was accustomed to human masses, must have been astonished. But it was only in the earliest times, that it produced its full effect, when the people was more a people than it is now. For, properly speaking, such an amphitheatre is constructed to give the people an imposing view of itself,—to cajole itself.\nWhen anything worth seeing occurs on the level ground, and any one runs to the spot, the hindermost try by every means to raise themselves above the foremost; they get upon benches, roll casks, bring up vehicles, lay planks in every direction, occupy the neighbouring heights, and a crater is formed in no time.\nIf the spectacle occur frequently on the same spot, light scaffoldings are built for those who are able to pay, and the rest of the multitude must get on as it can. Here the problem of the architect is to satisfy this general want. By means of his art he prepares such a crater, making it as simple as possible, that the people itself may constitute the decoration. When the populace saw itself so assembled, it must have been astonished at the sight, for whereas it was only accustomed to see itself running about in confusion, or to find itself crowded together without particular rule or order, so must this many-headed, many-minded, wandering animal now see itself combined into a noble body, made into a definite unity, bound and secured into a mass, and animated as one form by one mind. The simplicity of the oval is most pleasingly obvious to every eye, and every head serves as a measure to show the vastness of the whole. Now we see it empty, we have no standard, and do not know whether it is large or small.\nThe Veronese deserve commendation for the high preservation in which this edifice is kept. It is built of a reddish marble, which has been affected by the atmosphere, and hence the steps which have been eaten, are continually restored, and look almost all new. An inscription makes mention of one Hieronymus Maurigenus, and of the incredible industry, which he has expended on this monument. Of the outer wall only a piece remains, and I doubt whether it was ever quite finished. The lower arches, which adjoin the large square, called \"Il Bra,\" are let out to workmen, and the reanimation of these arcades produces a cheerful appearance.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe most beautiful gate, which, however, always remains closed, is called \"Porta stupa,\" or \"del Pallio.\" As a gate, and considering the great distance from which it is first seen, it is not well conceived, and it is not till we come near it, that we recognise the beauty of the structure.\nAll sorts of reasons are given to account for its being closed. I have, however, a conjecture of my own. It was manifestly the intention of the artist to cause a new Corso to be laid out from this gate, for the situation, or the present street, is completely wrong. On the left side there is nothing but barracks; and the line at right angles from the middle of the gate leads to a convent of nuns, which must certainly have come down. This was presently perceived, and besides the rich and higher classes might not have liked to settle in the remote quarter. The artist perhaps died, and therefore the door was closed, and so an end was put to the affair.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nThe portico of the theatre, consisting of six large Ionic columns, looks handsome enough. So much the more puny is the appearance of the Marchese di Maffei's bust, which as large as life, and in a great wig, stands over the door, and in front of a painted niche, which is supported by two Corinthian columns. The position is honorable, but to be in some degree proportionate to the magnitude and solidity of the columns, the bust should have been colossal. But now placed as it is on a corbel, it has a mean appearance, and is by no means in harmony with the whole.\nThe gallery, which incloses the fore-court, is also small, and the channelled Doric dwarfs have a mean appearance by the side of the smooth Ionic giants. But we pardon this discrepancy on account of the fine institution, which has been founded among the columns. Here is kept a number of antiquities, which have mostly been dug up in and about Verona. Something, they say, has even been found in the Amphitheatre. There are Etruscan, Greek, and Roman specimens, down to the latest times, and some even of more modern date. The bas-reliefs are inserted in the walls, and provided with the numbers, which Maffei gave them, when he described them in his work: \"Verona illustrata.\" There are altars, fragments of columns, and other relics of the sort; an admirable tripod of white marble, upon which there are genii occupied with the attributes of the gods. Raphael has imitated and improved this kind of thing in the scrolls of the Farnesina.\nThe wind which blows from the graves of the ancients, comes fragrantly over hills of roses. The tombs give touching evidences of a genuine feeling, and always bring life back to us. Here is a man, by the side of his wife, who peeps out of a niche, as if it were a window. Here are father and mother, with their son between them, eyeing each other as naturally as possible. Here a couple are grasping each other's hands. Here a father, resting on his couch, seems to be amused by his family. The immediate proximity of these stones was to me highly touching. They belong to a later school of art, but are simple, natural, and generally pleasing. Here a man in armour is on his knees in expectation of a joyful resurrection. With more or less of talent the artist has produced the mere simple presence of the persons, and has thus given a permanent continuation to their existence. They do not fold their hands, they do not look towards heaven, but they are here below just what they were and just what they are. They stand together, take interest in each other, love one another, and this is charmingly expressed on the stone, though with a certain want of technical skill. A marble pillar, very richly adorned, gave me more new ideas.\nLaudable as this institution is, we can plainly perceive that the noble spirit of preservation, by which it was founded, is no longer continued. The valuable tripod will soon be ruined, placed as it is in the open air, and exposed to the weather towards the west. This treasure might easily be preserved in a wooden case.\nThe palace of the Proveditore, which is begun, might have afforded a fine specimen of architecture, if it had been finished. Generally speaking, the nobili build a great deal, but unfortunately every one builds on the site of his former residence, and often, therefore, in narrow lanes. Thus, for instance, a magnificent façade to a seminary is now building in an alley of tire remotest suburb.\n\nWhile, with a guide, whom I had accidentally picked up, I passed before the great solemn gate of a singular building, he asked me good-humouredly, whether I should not like to step into the court for a while. It was the palace of justice, and the court, on account of the height of the building, looked only like an enormous wall. Here, he told me, all the criminals and suspicious persons are confined. I looked around, and saw that round all the stories there were open passages' fitted with iron balustrades, which passed by numerous doors. The prisoner, as he stepped out of his dungeon to be led to trial, stood in the open air, and was exposed to the gaze of all passers, and because there were several trial-rooms, the chains were rattling, now over this, now over that passage, in every story. It was a hateful sight, and I do not deny that the good humour, with which I had dispatched my \"Birds,\" might here have come into a strait.\n\nI walked at sunset upon the margin of the crater-like amphitheatre, and enjoyed the most splendid prospect over the town and the surrounding country. I was quite alone, and multitudes of people were passing below me on the hard stones of the Bra; men of all ranks, and women of the middle-ranks were walking. The latter in their black outer garments look, in this bird's-eye view, like so many mummies.\nThe Zendale and the Veste, which serves this class in the place of an entire wardrobe, is a costume completely fitted for a people that does not care much for cleanliness, and yet always likes to appear in public, sometimes at church, sometimes on the promenade. The Veste is a gown of black taffeta, which is thrown over other gowns. If the lady has a clean white one beneath, she contrives to lift up the black one on one side. This is fastened on so, as to cut the waist, and to cover the lappets of a corset, which may be of any colour. The Zendale is a large hood with long ears; the hood itself is kept high above the head by a wire-frame, while the ears are fastened round the body like a scarf, so that the ends fall down behind.\n\nVerona, Sept. 16.\nWhen I again left the Arena to-day, I came to a modern public spectacle, about a thousand paces from the spot. Four noble Veronese were playing ball against four people of Vicenza. This pastime is carried on among the Veronese themselves all the year round, about two hours before night. On this occasion there was a far larger concourse of people than usual, on account of the foreign adversaries. The spectators seem to have amounted to four or five thousand. I did not see women of any rank.\nWhen, a little while ago, I spoke of the necessities of the multitude in such a case, I described the natural accidental amphitheatre as arising just in the manner, in which I saw the people raised one over another on this occasion. Even at a distance I could hear the lively clapping of hands, which accompanied every important stroke. The game is played as follows: Two boards, slightly inclined, are placed at a convenient distance from each other. He who strikes off the ball stands at the higher end, his right hand is armed with a broad wooden ring, set with spikes. While another of his party throws the ball to him, he runs down to meet it, and thus increases the force of the blow with which he strikes it. The adversaries try to beat it back, and thus it goes backwards and forwards till, at last, it remains on the ground. The most beautiful attitudes, worthy of being imitated in marble, are thus produced. As there are none but well-grown active young people, in a short, close, white dress, the parties are only distinguished by a yellow mark. Particularly beautiful is the attitude into which the man on the eminence falls, when he runs down the inclined plain, and raises his arm to strike the ball;—it approaches that of the Borghesian gladiator.\nIt seemed strange to me that they carry on this exercise by an old lime-wall, without the slightest convenience for spectators; why is it not done in the amphitheatre, where there would be such ample room?\n\nVerona, September 17.\nWhat I have seen of pictures I will but briefly touch upon, and add some remarks. I do not make this extraordinary tour for the sake of deceiving myself, but to become acquainted with myself by means of these objects. I therefore honestly confess that of the painter's art—of his manipulation, I understand but little. My attention, and observation, can only be directed to the practical part, to the subject, and the general treatment of it.\nS. Georgio is a gallery of good pictures, all altar-pieces, and all remarkable, if not of equal value. But what subjects were the hapless artists obliged to paint? And for whom? Perhaps a shower of manna thirty feet long, and twenty feet high, with the miracle of the loaves as a companion. What could be made of these subjects? Hungry men falling on little grains, and a countless multitude of others, to whom bread is handed. The artists have racked their invention in order to get something striking out of such wretched subjects. And yet, stimulated by the urgency of the case, genius has produced some beautiful things. An artist, who had to paint S. Ursula with the eleven thousand virgins, has got over the difficulty cleverly enough. The saint stands in the foreground, as if she had conquered the country. She is very noble, like an Amazonia's virgin, and without any enticing charms; on the other hand, her troop is shown descending from the ships, and moving in procession at a diminishing distance. The Assumption of the Virgin, by Titian, in the dome, has become much blackened, and it is a thought worthy of praise that, at the moment of her apotheosis, she looks not towards heaven, but towards her friends below.\nIn the Gherardini Gallery I found some very fine things by Orbitto, and for the first time became acquainted with this meritorious artist. At a distance we only hear of the first artists, and then we are often contented with names only; but when we draw nearer to this starry sky, and the luminaries of the second and third magnitude also begin to twinkle, each one coming forward and occupying his proper place in the whole constellation, then the world becomes wide, and art becomes rich. I must here commend the conception of one of the pictures. Sampson has gone to sleep in the lap of Dalilah, and she has softly stretched her hand over him to reach a pair of scissors, which lies near the lamp on the table. The execution is admirable. In the Canopa Palace I observed a Danäe.\nThe Bevilagua Palace contains the most valuable things. A picture by Tintoretto, which is called a \"Paradise,\" but which, in fact, represents the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, in the presence of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, saints, angels, &c., affords an opportunity for displaying all the riches of the most felicitous genius. To admire and enjoy all that care of manipulation, that spirit and variety of expression, it is necessary to possess the picture, and to have it before one all one's life. The painter's work is carried on ad infinitum,; even the farthest angels' heads, which are vanishing in the halo, preserve something of character. The largest figures may be about a foot high; Mary, and the Christ who is crowning her, about four inches. Eve is, however, the finest woman in the picture; a little voluptuous, as from time immemorial.\nA couple of portraits by Paul Veronese have only increased my veneration for that artist. The collection of antiquities is very fine; there is a son of Niobe extended in death, which is highly valuable; and the busts, including an Augustus with the civic crown, a Caligula, and others, are mostly of great interest, notwithstanding the restoration of the noses.\nIt lies in my nature to admire, willingly and joyfully, all that is great and beautiful, and the cultivation of this talent, day after day, hour after hour, by the inspection of such beautiful objects, produces the happiest feelings.\nIn a land, where we enjoy the days but take especial delight in the evenings, the time of nightfall is highly important. For now work ceases; those who have gone out walking turn back; the father wishes to have his daughter home again; the day has an end. What the day is we Cimmerians hardly know. In our eternal mist and fog it is the same thing to us, whether it be day or night, for how much time can we really pass and enjoy in the open air? Now, when night sets in, the day, which consisted of a morning and an evening, is decidedly past, four and twenty hours are gone, the bells ring, the rosary is taken in hand, and the maid, entering the chamber with the lighted lamp, says, \"felicissima notte.\" This epoch varies with every season, and a man who lives here in actual life cannot go wrong, because all the enjoyments of his existence are regulated not by the nominal hour, but by the time of day. If the people were forced to use a German clock they would be perplexed, for their own is intimately connected with their nature. About an hour and a half, or an hour before midnight, the nobility begin to ride out. They proceed to the Piazza della Bra, along the long, broad street to the Porta Nuova out at the gate, and along the city, and when night sets in, they all return home. Sometimes they go to the churches to say their Ave Maria della sera: sometimes they keep on the Bra, where the cavaliers step up to the coaches and converse for a while with the ladies. The foot passengers remain till a late hour of night, but I have never stopped till the last. To-day just enough rain had fallen to lay the dust, and the spectacle was most cheerful and animated.\nThat I may accommodate myself the better to the custom of the country I have devised a plan for mastering more easily the Italian method of reckoning the hours. The accompanying diagram may give an idea of it. The inner circle denotes our four and twenty hours, from midnight to midnight, divided into twice twelve, as we reckon, and as our clocks indicate. The middle circle shows how the clocks strike at the present season, namely, as much as twelve twice in the twenty-four hours, but in such a way that it strikes one, when it strikes eight with us, and so on till the number twelve is complete. At eight o'clock in the morning according to our clock it again strikes one, and so on. Finally the outer circle shows how the four and twenty hours are reckoned in actual life. For example, I hear seven o'clock striking in the night, and know that midnight is at five o'clock; I therefore deduct the latter number from the former, and thus have two hours after midnight. If I hear seven o'clock strike in the day-time, and know that noon is at five, I proceed in the same way, and thus have two in the afternoon. But if I wish to express the hour according to the fashion of this country, I must know that noon is seventeen o'clock; I add the two, and get nineteen o'clock. When this method is heard and thought of for the first time, it seems extremely confused and difficult to manage, but we soon grow accustomed to it and find the occupation amusing. The people themselves take delight in this perpetual calculation, just as children are pleased with easily surmounted difficulties. Indeed they always have their fingers in the air, make any calculation in their heads, and like to occupy themselves with figures. Besides to the inhabitant of the country the matter is so much the easier, as he really does not trouble himself about noon and midnight, and does not, like the foreign resident, compare two clocks with each other. They only count from the evening the hours, as they strike, and in the day-time they add the number to the varying number of noon, with which they are acquainted. The rest is explained by the remarks appended to the diagram:—\nVerona, Sept. 17.\nThe people here jostle one another actively enough; the narrow streets, where shops and workmen's stalls are thickly crowded together, have a particularly cheerful look. There is no such thing as a door in front of the shop or workroom; the whole breadth of the house is open, and one may see all that passes in the interior. Half-way out into the path, the tailors are sewing; and the cobblers are pulling and rapping; indeed the work-stalls make a part of the street. In the evening, when the lights are burning, the appearance is most lively.\nThe squares are very full on market days; there are fruit and vegetables without number, and garlic and onions to the heart's desire. Then again throughout the day there is a ceaseless screaming, bantering, singing, squalling, huzzaing, and laughing. The mildness of the air, and the cheapness of the food, make subsistence easy. Everything possible is done in the open air.\nAt night singing and all sorts of noises begin. The ballad of \"Marlbrook\" is heard in every street;—then comes a dulcimer, then a violin. They try to imitate all the birds with a pipe. The strangest sounds are heard on every side. A mild climate can give this exquisite enjoyment of mere existence, even to poverty, and the very shadow of the people seems respectable.\nThe want of cleanliness and convenience, which so much strikes us in the houses, arises from the following cause:—the inhabitants are always out of doors, and in their light-heartedness think of nothing. With the people all goes right, even the middle-class man just lives on from day to day, while the rich and genteel shut themselves up in their dwellings, which are not so habitable as in the north. Society is found in the open streets. Fore-courts and colonnades are all soiled with filth, for things are done in the most natural manner. The people always feel their way before them. The rich man may be rich, and build his palaces; and the nobile may rule, but if he makes a colonnade or a fore-court, the people will make use of it for their own occasions, and have no more urgent wish than to get rid as soon as possible, of that which they have taken as often as possible. If a person cannot bear this, he must not play the great gentleman, that is to say, he must act as if a part of his dwelling belonged to the public. He may shut his door, and all will be right. But in open buildings the people are not to be debarred of their privileges, and this, throughout Italy, is a nuisance to the foreigner.\nTo-day I remarked in several streets of the town, the customs and manners of the middle-classes especially, who appear very numerous and busy. They swing their arms as they walk. Persons of a high rank, who on certain occasions wear a sword, swing only one arm, being accustomed to hold the left arm still.\nAlthough the people are careless enough with respect to their own wants and occupations, they have a keen eye for everything foreign. Thus in the very first days, I observed that every one took notice of my boots, because here they are too expensive an article of dress to wear even in winter. Now I wear shoes and stockings nobody looks at me. Particularly I noticed this morning, when all were running about with flowers, vegetables, garlic, and other market-stuff, that a twig of cypress, which I carried in my hand, did not escape them. Some green cones hung upon it, and I held in the same hand some blooming caper-twigs. Everybody, large and small, watched me closely, and seemed to entertain some whimsical thought.\nI brought these twigs from the Giusti garden, which is finely situated, and in which there are monstrous cypresses, all pointed up like spikes into the air. The Taxus, which in northern gardening we find cut to a sharp point, is probably an imitation of this splendid natural product. A tree, the branches of which, the oldest as well as the youngest, are striving to reach heaven,—a tree which will last its three hundred years, is well worthy of veneration. Judging from the time when this garden was laid out, these trees have already attained that advanced age.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThe way from Verona hither is very pleasant: we go north-eastwards along the mountains, always keeping to the left the foremost mountains, which consist of sand, lime, clay, and marl; the hills which they form, are dotted with villages, castles, and houses. To the right extends the broad plain, along which the road goes. The straight broad path, which is in good preservation, goes through a fertile field; we look into deep avenues of trees, up which the vines are trained to a considerable height, and then drop down, like pendant branches. Here we can get an admirable idea of festoons! The grapes are ripe, and are heavy on the tendrils, which hang down long and trembling. The road is filled with people of every class and occupation, and I was particularly pleased by some carts, with low solid wheels, which, with teams of fine oxen, carry the large vats, in which the grapes from the vineyards are put and pressed. The drivers rode in them when they were empty, and the whole was like a triumphal procession of Bacchanals. Between the ranks of vines the ground is used for all sorts of grain, especially Indian corn and millet (Sörgel).\nAs one goes towards Vicenza, the hills again rise from north to south and enclose the plain; they are, it is said, volcanic. Vicenza lies at their foot, or if you will, in a bosom which they form.\n\nVicenza, Sept. 19.\nThough I have been here only a few hours, I have already run through the town, and seen the Olympian theatre, and the buildings of Palladio. A very pretty little book is published here, for the convenience of foreigners, with copper-plates and some letter-press, that shows knowledge of art. When once one stands in the presence of these works, one immediately perceives their great value, for they are calculated to fill the eye with their actual greatness and massiveness, and to satisfy the mind by the beautiful harmony of their dimensions, not only in abstract sketches, but with all the prominences and distances of perspective. Therefore I say of Palladio: he was a man really and intrinsically great, whose greatness was outwardly manifested. The chief difficulty with which this man, like all modern architects, had to struggle, was the suitable application of the orders of columns to buildings for domestic or public use; for there is always a contradiction in the combination of columns and walls. But with what success has he not worked them up together! What an imposing effect has the aspect of his edifices: at the sight of them one almost forgets that he is attempting to reconcile us to a violation of the rules of his art. There is, indeed, something divine about his designs, which may be exactly compared to the creations of the great poet, who, out of truth and falsehood elaborates something between both, and charms us with its borrowed existence.\nThe Olympic theatre is a theatre of the ancients, realized on a small scale, and indescribably beautiful. However, compared with our theatres, it reminds me of a genteel, rich, well-bred child, contrasted with a shrewd man of the world, who, though he is neither so rich, nor so genteel, and well-bred, knows better how to employ his resources.\nIf we contemplate, on the spot, the noble buildings which Palladio has erected, and see how they are disfigured by the mean filthy necessities of the people, how the plans of most of them exceeded the means of those who undertook them, and how little these precious monuments of one lofty mind are adapted to all else around, the thought occurs, that it is just the same with everything else; for we receive but little thanks from men, when we would elevate their internal aspirations, give them a great idea of themselves, and make them feel the grandeur of a really noble existence. But when one cajoles them, tells them tales, and helping them on from day to day, makes them worse, then one is just the man they like; and hence it is that modern times take delight in so many absurdities. I do not say this to lower my friends, I only say that they are so, and that people must not be astonished to find everything just as it is.\nHow the Basilica of Palladio looks by the side of an old castellated kind of a building, dotted all over with windows of different sizes (whose removal, tower and all, the artist evidently contemplated),—it is impossible to describe—and besides I must now, by a strange effort, compress my own feelings, for, I too, alas! find here side by side both what I seek and what I fly from.\n\nSept. 20.\nYesterday we had the opera, which lasted till midnight, and I was glad to get some rest. The three Sultanesses and the Rape of the Seraglio have afforded several tatters, out of which the piece has been patched up, with very little skill. The music is agreeable to the ear, but is probably by an amateur; for not a single thought struck me as being new. The ballets, on the other hand, were charming. The principle pair of dancers executed an Allemande to perfection.\nThe theatre is new, pleasant, beautiful, modestly magnificent, uniform throughout, just as it ought to be in a provincial town. Every box has hangings of the same color, and the one belonging to the Capitan Grande, is only distinguished from the rest, by the fact that the hangings are somewhat longer.\nThe prima donna, who is a great favorite of the whole people, is tremendously applauded, on her entrance, and the \"gods\" are quite obstreperous with their delight, when she does anything remarkably well, which very often happens. Her manners are natural, she has a pretty figure, a fine voice, a pleasing countenance, and, above all, a really modest demeanour, while there might be more grace in the arms. However, I am not what I was, I feel that I am spoiled, I am spoiled for a \"god.\"\n\nSept. 21.\nTo-day I visited Dr. Tura. Five years ago he passionately devoted himself to the study of plants, formed a herbarium of the Italian flora, and laid out a botanical garden under the superintendence of the former bishop. However, all that has come to an end. Medical practice drove away natural history, the herbarium is eaten by worms, the bishop is dead, and the botanic garden is again rationally planted with cabbages and garlic.\nDr. Tura is a very refined and good man. He told me his history with frankness, purity of mind, and modesty, and altogether spoke in a very definite and affable manner. At the same time he did not like to open his cabinets, which perhaps were in no very presentable condition. Our conversation soon came to a stand-still.\n\nSept. 21. Evening.\nI called upon the old architect Scamozzi, who has published an edition of Palladio's buildings, and is a diligent artist, passionately devoted to his art. He gave me some directions, being delighted with my sympathy. Among Palladio's buildings there is one, for which I always had an especial predilection, and which is said to have been his own residence When it is seen close, there is far more in it than appears in a picture. I should have liked to draw it, and to illuminate it with colors, to show the material and the age. It must not, however, be imagined that the architect has built himself a palace. The house is the most modest in the world, with only two windows, separated from each other by a broad space, which would admit a third. If it were imitated in a picture, which should exhibit the neighbouring houses at the same time, the spectator would be pleased to observe how it has been let in between them. Canaletto was the man who should have painted it.\n\nTo-day I visited the splendid building which stands on a pleasant elevation about half a league from the town, and is called the \"Rotonda.\" It is a quadrangular building, enclosing a circular hall, lighted from the top. On all the four sides, you ascend a broad flight of steps, and always come to a vestibule, which is formed of six Corinthian columns. Probably the luxury of architecture was never carried to so high a point. The space occupied by the steps and vestibules is much larger than that occupied by the house itself; for every one of the sides is as grand and pleasing as the front of a temple. With respect to the inside it may be called habitable, but not comfortable. The hall is of the finest proportions, and so are the chambers; but they would hardly suffice for the actual wants of any genteel family in a summer-residence. On the other hand it presents a most beautiful appearance, as it is viewed on every side throughout the district. The variety which is produced by the principal mass, as, together with the projecting columns, it is gradually brought before the eyes of the spectator who walks round it, is very great; and the purpose of the owner, who wished to leave a large trust-estate, and at the same time a visible monument of his wealth, is completely obtained. And while the building appears in all its magnificence, when viewed from any spot in the district, it also forms the point of view for a most agreeable prospect. You may see the Bachiglione flowing along, and taking vessels down from Verona to the Brenta, while you overlook the extensive possessions which the Marquis Capra wished to preserve undivided in his family. The inscriptions on the four gable-ends, which together constitute one whole, are worthy to be noted down:\nMarcus Capra Gabrielis filius\nQui ædes has Arctissimo\nprimogenituræ gradui subjecit\nUna cum omnibus\nCensibus agrisvallibus et collibus\nCitra viam magnam\nMemorise perpetuæ mandans hæc\nDum sustinet ac abstinet.\nThe conclusion in particular is strange enough. A man who has at command so much wealth and such a capacious will, still feels that he must bear and forbear. This can be learned at a less expense.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis evening I was at a meeting held by the academy of the \"Olympians.\" It is mere play-work, but good in its way, and seems to keep up a little spice and life among the people. There is the great hall by Palladio's theatre, handsomely lighted up; the Capitan and a portion of the nobility are present, besides a public composed of educated persons, and several of the clergy; the whole assembly amounting to about five hundred.\nThe question proposed by the president for to-day's sitting was this: \"Which has been most serviceable to the fine arts, invention or imitation?\" This was a happy notion, for if the alternatives which are involved in the question are kept duly apart, one may go on debating for centuries. The academicians have gallantly availed themselves of the occasion, and have produced all sorts of things in prose and verse,—some very good.\nThen there is the liveliest public. The audience cry bravo, and clap their hands and laugh. What a thing it is to stand thus before one's nation, and amuse them in person! We must set down our best productions in black and white; every one squats down with them in a corner, and scribbles at them as he can.\nIt may be imagined that even on this occasion Palladio would be continually appealed to, whether the discourse was in favour of invention or imitation. At the end, which is always the right place for a joke, one of the speakers hit on a happy thought, and said that the others had already taken Palladio away from him, so that he, for his part, would praise Franceschini, the great silk-manufacturer. He then began to show the advantages which this enterprising man, and through him the city of Vicenza, had derived from imitating the Lyonnese and Florentine stuffs, and thence came to the conclusion that imitation stands far above invention. This was done with so much humour, that uninterrupted laughter was excited. Generally those who spoke in favor of imitation obtained the most applause, for they said nothing but what was adapted to the thoughts and capacities of the multitude. Once the public, by a violent clapping of hands, gave its hearty approval to a most clumsy sophism, when it had not felt many good—nay, excellent things, that had been said in honour of invention. I am very glad I have witnessed this scene, for it is highly gratifying to see Palladio, after the lapse of so long a time, still honoured by his fellow-citizens, as their polar-star and model.\n\nSept. 22.\nThis morning I was at Tiene, which lies north towards the mountains, where a new building has been erected after an old plan, of which there may be a little to say. Thus do they here honour everything that belongs to the good period, and have sense enough to raise a new building on a plan which they have inherited. The château is excellently situated in a large plain, having behind it the calcareous Alps, without any mountains intervening. A stream of living water flows along the level causeway from each side of the building, towards those who approach it, and waters the broad fields of rice through which one passes.\nI have now seen but two Italian cities, and for the first time, and have spoken with but few persons, and yet I know my Italians pretty well. They are like courtiers, who consider themselves the first people in the world, and who, on the strength of certain advantages, which cannot be denied them, can indulge with impunity in so comfortable a thought. The Italians appear to me a right good people. Only one must see the children and the common people as I see them now, and can see them, while I am always open to them,—nay, always lay myself open to them. What figures and faces there are!\nIt is especially to be commended in the Vicentians, that with them one enjoys the privileges of a large city. Whatever a person does, they do not stare at him, but if he addresses them, they are conversable and pleasant, especially the women, who please me much. I do not mean to find fault with the Veronese women; they are well made and have a decided pupil, but they are, for the most part, pale, and the Zendal is to their disadvantage, because one looks for something charming under the beautiful costume. I have found here some very pretty creatures, especially some with black locks, who inspire me with peculiar interest. There are also fairer beauties who, however, do not please me so well.\n\nPadua, Sept. 26. Evening.\nIn four hours I have this day come here from Vicenza, crammed luggage and all into a little one-seated chaise, called a \"Sediola.\" Generally the journey is performed with ease in three hours and a half, but as I wished to pass the delightful day-time in the open air, I was glad that the Vetturino fell short of his duty. The route goes constantly southwards over the most fertile plains, and between hedges and trees, without further prospect, until at last the beautiful mountains, extending from the east towards the south, are seen on the right hand. The abundance of the festoons of plants and fruit, which hang over walls and hedges, and down the trees, is indescribable. The roofs are loaded with gourds, and the strangest sort of cucumbers are hanging from poles and trellises.\nFrom the observatory I could take the clearest survey possible of the fine situation of the town. Towards the north are the Tyrolese mountains, covered with snow, and half hidden by clouds, and joined by the Vicentian mountains on the north-west. Then towards the west are the nearer mountains of Este, the shapes and recesses of which are plainly to be seen. Towards the south-east is a verdant sea of plants, without a trace of elevation, tree after tree, bush after bush, plantation after plantation, while houses, villas, and churches, dazzling with whiteness, peer out from among the green. Against the horizon I plainly saw the tower of St. Mark's at Venice, with other smaller towers.\n\nPadua, Sept. 27.\nI have at last obtained the works of Palladio, not indeed the original edition, which I saw at Vicenza, where the cuts are in wood, but a fac-simile in copper, published at the expense of an excellent man, named Smith, who was formerly the English consul at Venice. We must give the English this credit, that they have long known how to prize what is good, and have a magnificent way of diffusing it.\nOn the occasion of this purchase I entered a book-shop, which in Italy presents quite a peculiar appearance. Around it are arranged the books, all stitched, and during the whole day good society may be found in the shop, which is a lounge for all the secular clergy, nobility, and artists who are in any way connected with literature. One asks for a book, opens it, and amuses himself as one can. Thus I found a knot of half a dozen all of whom became attentive to me, when I asked for the works of Palladio. While the master of the shop looked for the book, they commended it, and gave me information respecting the original and the copy; they were well acquainted with the work itself and with the merits of the author. Taking me for an architect they praised me for having recourse to this master in preference to all the rest, saying that he was of more practical utility than Vitruvius himself, since he had thoroughly studied the ancients and antiquity, and had sought to adapt the latter to the wants of our own times. I conversed for a long time with these friendly men, learned something about the remarkable objects in the city, and took my leave.\nWhere men have built churches to saints, a place may sometimes be found in them, where monuments to intellectual men may be set up. The bust of Cardinal Bembo stands between Ionic columns. It is a handsome face, strongly drawn in, if I may use the expression, and with a copious beard. The inscription runs thus: \"Petri Bembi Card. imaginem Hier. Guerinus Ismeni f. in publico ponendam curavit ut cujus ingenii monumenta æterna sint, ejus corporis quoque memoria ne a posteritate desideretur.\"\nWith all its dignity the University gave me the horrors, as a building. I am glad that I had nothing to learn in it. One cannot imagine such a narrow compass for a school, even though, as the student of a German university, one may have suffered a great deal on the benches of the Auditorium. The anatomical theatre is a perfect model of the art of pressing students together. The audience are piled one above another in a tall pointed funnel. They look down upon the narrow space where the table stands, and, as no daylight falls upon it, the Professor must demonstrate by lamplight. The botanic garden is much more pretty and cheerful. Several plants can remain in the ground during the winter, if they are set near the walls, or at no great distance from them. At the end of October the whole is built over, and the process of heating is carried on for the few remaining months. It is pleasant and instructive to walk through a vegetation that is strange to us. With ordinary plants, as well as with other objects that have been long familiar to us, we at last do not think at all, and what is looking without thinking? Amidst this variety which comes upon me quite new, the idea that all forms of plants may, perhaps, be developed from a single form, becomes more lively than ever. On this principle alone it would be possible to define orders and classes, which, it seems to me, has hitherto been done in a very arbitrary manner. At this point I stand fast in my botanical philosophy, and I do not see how I am to extricate myself. The depth and breadth of this business seem to me quite equal.\nThe great square, called Prato della Valle, is a very wide space, where the chief fair is held in June. The wooden booths in the middle of it do not produce the most favourable appearance, but the inhabitants assure me that there will soon be a fièra of stone here, like that at Verona. One has hopes of this already, from the manner in which the Prato is surrounded, and which affords a very beautiful and imposing view.\nA huge oval is surrounded with statues, all representing celebrated men, who have taught or studied at the University. Any native or foreigner is allowed to erect a statue of a certain size to any countryman or kinsman, as soon as the merit of the person and his academical residence at Padua are proved.\nA moat filled with water goes round the oval. On the four bridges which lead up to it stand colossal figures of Popes and Doges; the other statues, which are smaller, have been set up by corporations, private individuals, or foreigners. The King of Sweden caused a figure of Gustavus Adolphus to be erected, because it is said he once heard a lecture in Padua. The Archduke Leopold revived the memory of Petrarch and Galileo. The statues are in a good, modern style, a few of them rather affected, some very natural, and all in the costume of their rank and dignity. The inscriptions deserve commendation. There is nothing in them absurd or paltry.\nAt any university the thought would have been a happy one (and here it is particularly so), because it is very delightful to see a whole line of departed worthies thus called back again. It will perhaps form a very beautiful Prato, when the wooden Fièra shall be removed, and one built of stone, according to the aforesaid plan.\nIn the consistory of a fraternity dedicated to S. Anthony, there are some pictures of an early date, which remind one of the old German paintings, and also some by Titian, in which may be remarked the great progress which no one has made on the other side of the Alps. Immediately afterwards I saw works by some of the most modern painters. These artists, as they could not hope to succeed in the lofty and the serious, have been very happy in hitting the humorous. The decollation of John by Piazetta is, in this sense, a capital picture, if one can once allow the master's manner. John is kneeling, with his hands before him, and his right knee on a stone, looking towards heaven. One of the soldiers, who is binding him, is bending round on one side, and looking into his face, as if he was wondering at his patient resignation. Higher up stands another, who is to deal the fatal blow. He does not, however, hold the sword, but makes a motion with his hands, like one who is practising the stroke beforehand. A third is drawing the sword out of the scabbard. The thought is happy, if not grand, and the composition is striking and produces the best effect.\nIn the church of the Eremitani I have seen pictures by Mantegna, one of the older painters, at which I am astonished. What a sharp, strict actuality is exhibited in these pictures! It is from this actuality, thoroughly true, not apparent, merely and falsely effective, and appealing solely to the imagination, but solid, pure, bright, elaborated, conscientious, delicate, and circumscribed—an actuality which had about it something severe, credulous, and laborious; it is from this, I say, that the later painters proceeded (as I remarked in the pictures of Titian), in order that by the liveliness of their own genius, the energy of their nature illumined at the same time by the mind of the predecessors, and exalted by their force, they might rise higher and higher, and elevated above the earth, produce forms that were heavenly indeed, but still true. Thus was art developed after the barbarous period.\nThe hall of audience in the town-house, properly designated by the augmentative \"Salone,\" is such a huge inclosure that one cannot conceive it, much less recall it to one's immediate memory. It is three hundred feet long, one hundred feet broad, and one hundred feet high, measured up to the roof, which covers it quite in. So accustomed are these people to live in the open air, that the architects look out for a market-place to over-arch. And there is no question that this huge vaulted space produces quite a peculiar effect. It is an inclosed infinity, which has more analogy to man's habits and feelings than the starry heavens. The latter takes us out of ourselves, the former insensibility brings us back to ourselves.\nFor the same reason I also like to stay in the Church of S. Justina. This church, which is eighty-five feet long, and high and broad in proportion, is built in a grand and simple style. This evening I seated myself in a corner, and indulged in quiet contemplation. Then I felt myself truly alone, for no one in the world, even if he had thought of me for the moment, would have looked for me here.\nNow everything ought to be packed up again, for to-morrow morning I set off by water, upon the Brenta. It rained to-day, but now it has cleared up, and I hope I shall be able to see the lagunes and the Bride of the Sea by beautiful daylight, and to greet my friends from her bosom.\n\nVENICE\nNow it stood written on my page in the Book of Fate, that on the evening of the 28th of September, by 5 o'clock, German time, I should see Venice for the first time, as I passed from the Brenta into the lagunes, and that, soon afterwards, I should actually enter: and visit this strange island-city, this heaven-like republic. So now, Heaven be praised, Venice is no longer to me a bare and a hollow name, which has so long tormented me,—me, the mental enemy of mere verbal sounds.\nAs the first of the gondoliers came up to the ship (they come in order to convey more quickly to Venice those passengers who are in a hurry), I recollected an old plaything, of which, perhaps, I had not thought for twenty years. My father had a beautiful model of a gondola which he had brought with him [from Italy]; he set a great value upon it, and it was considered a great treat, when I was allowed to play with it. The first beaks of tinned iron-plate, the black gondola-gratings, all greeted me like old acquaintances, and I experienced again dear emotions of my childhood which had been long unknown.\nI am well lodged at the sign of the Queen of England, not far from the square of S. Mark, which is, indeed, the chief advantage of the snot. My windows look upon a narrow canal between lofty houses, a bridge of one arch is immediately below me, and directly opposite is a narrow, bustling alley. Thus am I lodged, and here I shall remain until I have made up my packet for Germany, and until I am satiated with the sight of the city. I can now really enjoy the solitude for which I have longed so ardently, for nowhere does a man feel himself more solitary than in a crowd, where he must push his way unknown to every one. Perhaps in Venice there is only one person who knows me, and he will not come in contact with me all at once.\n\nVenice, September 28, 1786.\nA few words on my journey hither from Padua. The passage on the Brenta, in the public vessel, and in good company, is highly agreeable. The banks are ornamented with gardens and villas, little hamlets come down to the water's edge, and the animated highroad may be seen here and there. As the descent of the river is by means of locks, there is often a little pause, which may be employed in looking about the country, and in tasting the fruits, which are offered in great abundance. You then enter your vessel again, and move on through a world, which is itself in motion, and which is full of life and fertility.\nTo so many changing forms and images a phenomenon was added, which, although derived from Germany, was quite in its place here—I mean two pilgrims, the first whom I have seen closely. They have a right to travel gratis in this public conveyance; but because the rest of the passengers dislike coming into contact with them, they do not sit in the covered part, but in the after-part beside the steersman. They were stared at as a phenomenon even at the present day, and as in former times many vagabonds had made use of this cloak, they were but lightly esteemed. When I learned that they were Germans, and could speak no language but their own, I joined them, and found that they came from the Paderborn territory. Both of them were men of more than fifty years of age, and of a dark, but good-humoured physiognomy. They had first visited the sepulchre of the \"Three Kings\" at Cologne, had then travelled through Germany, and were now together on their way back to Borne and Upper Italy, whence one intended to set out for Westphalia, and the other to pay a visit of adoration to St. James of Compostella.\nTheir dress was the well-known costume of pilgrims, but they looked much better with this tucked up robe, than the pilgrims in long taffeta garments, we are accustomed to exhibit at our masquerades. The long cape, the round hat, the staff and cockle (the latter used as the most innocent drinking-vessel)—all had its signification, and its immediate use, while a tin-case held their passports. Most remarkable of all were their small, red morocco pocket-books, in which they kept all the little implements that might be wanted for any simple necessity. They took them out on finding that something wanted mending in their garments.\nThe steersman, highly pleased to find an interpreter, made me ask them several questions, and thus I learned a great deal about their views, and especially about their expedition. They made bitter complaints against their brethren in the faith, and even against the clergy, both secular and monastic. Piety, they said, must be a very scarce commodity, since no one would believe in theirs, but they were treated as vagrants in almost every Catholic country, although they produced the route which had been clerically prescribed, and the passports given by the bishop. On the other hand, they described, with a great deal of emotion, how well they had been received by protestants, and made special mention of a country clergyman in Suabia, and still more of his wife, who had prevailed on her somewhat unwilling husband to give them an abundant repast, of which they stood in great need. On taking leave, the good couple had given them a \"convention's dollar,\"[3] which they found very serviceable, as soon as they entered the Catholic territory. Upon this, one of them said, with all the elevation of which he was capable: \"We include this lady every day in our prayers, and implore God that he will open her eyes, as he has opened her heart towards us, and take her, although late, into the bosom of the Catholic Church. And thus we hope that we shall meet her in Paradise hereafter.\"\nAs I sat upon the little gang-way which led to the deck, I explained as much as was necessary and useful to the steers-man, and to some other persons who had crowded from the cabin into this narrow space. The pilgrims received some paltry donations, for the Italian is not fond of giving. Upon this they drew out some little consecrated tickets, on which might be seen the representation of the three sainted kings, with some prayers addressed to them. The worthy men entreated me to distribute these tickets among the little party, and explain how invaluable they were. In this I succeeded perfectly, for when the two men appeared to be greatly embarrassed as to how they should find the convent devoted to pilgrims in so large a place as Venice, the steersman was touched, and promised that, when they landed, he would give a boy a trifle to lead them to that distant spot. He added to me in confidence, that they would find but little welcome. \"The institution,\" he said, \"was founded to admit I don't know how many pilgrims, but now it has become greatly contracted, and the revenues are otherwise employed.\"\nDuring this conversation we had gone down the beautiful Brenta, leaving behind us many a noble garden, and many a noble palace, and casting a rapid glance at the populous and thriving hamlets, which lay along the banks. Several gondolas wound about the ship as soon as we had entered the lagunes. A Lombard, well acquainted with Venice, asked me to accompany him, that we might enter all the quicker, and escape the nuisance of the custom-house. Those who endeavoured to hold us back, he contrived to put off with a little drink-money, and so, in a cheerful sunset, we floated to the place of our destination.\n[3]\nA \"convention's dollar\" is a dollar coined in consequence of an agreement made between several of the German states, in the year 1750, when the Viennese standard was adopted.—Trans.\n\nSept. 29 (Michaelmas-Day). Evening.\nSo much has already been told and printed about Venice, that I shall not be circumstantial in my description, but shall only say how it struck me. Now, in this instance again, that which makes the chief impression upon me, is the people,—a great mass, who live an involuntary existence determined by the changing circumstances of the moment.\nIt was for no idle fancy that this race fled to these islands; it was no mere whim which impelled those who followed to combine with them; necessity taught them to look for security in a highly disadvantageous situation, that afterwards became most advantageous, enduing them with talent, when the whole northern world was immersed in gloom. Their increase and their wealth were a necessary consequence. New dwellings arose close against dwellings, rocks took the place of sand and marsh, houses sought the sky, being forced like trees inclosed in a narrow compass, to seek in height what was denied them in breadth. Being niggards of every inch of ground, as having been from the very first compressed into a narrow compass, they allowed no more room for the streets than was just necessary to separate a row of houses from the one opposite, and to afford the citizens a narrow passage. Moreover, water supplied the place of street, square, and promenade. The Venetian was forced to become a new creature; and thus Venice can only be compared with itself. The large canal, winding like a serpent, yields to no street in the world, and nothing can be put by the side of the space in front of St. Mark's square—I mean that great mirror of water, which is encompassed by Venice Proper, in the form of a crescent. Across the watery surface you see to the left the island of St. Georgio Maggiore, to the right a little, further off the Guidecca and its canal, and still more distant the Dogana (Custom-house) and the entrance into the Canal Grande, where right before us two immense marble temples are glittering in the sunshine. All the views and prospects have been so often engraved, that my friends will have no difficulty in forming a clear idea of them.\nAfter dinner I hastened to fix my first impression of the whole, and without a guide, and merely observing the cardinal points, threw myself into the labyrinth of the city, which though everywhere intersected by larger or smaller canals, is again connected by bridges. The narrow and crowded appearance of the whole cannot be conceived by one who has not seen it. In most cases one can quite or nearly measure the breadth of the street, by stretching out one's arms, and in the narrowest, a person would scrape his elbows if he walked with his arms a-kimbo. Some streets, indeed, are wider, and here and there is a little square, but comparatively all may be called narrow.\nI easily found the grand canal, and the principal bridge—the Rialto, which consists of a single arch of white marble. Looking down from this, one has a fine prospect,—the canal full of ships, which bring every necessary from the continent, and put in chiefly at this place to unload, while between them is a swarm of gondolas. To-day, especially, being Michaelmas, the view was wonderfully animated; but to give some notion of it, I must go back a little.\nThe two principal parts of Venice, which are divided by the grand canal, are connected by no other bridge than the Rialto, but several means of communication are provided, and the river is crossed in open boats at certain fixed points. To-day a very pretty effect was produced, by the number of well-dressed ladies, who, their features concealed beneath large black veils, were being ferried over in large parties at a time, in order to go to the church of the Archangel, whose festival was being solemnised. I left the bridge and went to one of the points of landing, to see the parties as they left the boats. I discovered some very fine forms and faces among them.\nAfter I had become tired of this amusement. I seated myself in a gondola, and, quitting the narrow streets with the intention of witnessing a spectacle of an opposite description, went along the northern part of the grand canal, into the lagunes, and then entered the canal della Guidecca, going as far as the square of St. Mark. Now was I also one of the birds of the Adriatic sea, as every Venetian feels himself to be, whilst reclining in his gondola. I then thought with due honour of my good father, who knew of nothing better than to talk about the things I now witnessed. And will it not be so with me likewise? All that surrounds me is dignified—a grand venerable work of combined human energies, a noble monument, not of a ruler, but of a people. And if their lagunes are gradually filling up, if unwholesome vapours are floating over the marsh, if their trade is declining and their power has sunk, still the great place and the essential character will not for a moment, be less venerable to the observer. Venice succumbs to time, like everything that has a phenomenal existence.\n\nSept. 30.\nTowards evening I again rambled, without a guide, into the remotest quarters of the city. The bridges here are all provided with stairs, that gondolas, and even larger vessels, may pass conveniently under the arches. I sought to find my way in and out of this labyrinth, without asking anybody, and, on this occasion also, only guiding myself by the points of the compass. One disentangles one's self at last, but it is a wonderful complication, and my manner of obtaining a sensible impression of it, is the best. I have now been to the remotest points of the city, and observed the conduct, mode of life, manners, and character of the inhabitants; and in every quarter they are different. Gracious Heaven!—What a poor good sort of animal man is, after all!\nMost of the smaller houses stand immediately on the canals, but there are here and there quays of stone, beautifully paved, along which one may take a pleasant walk between the water, and the churches, and palaces. Particularly cheerful and agreeable is the long stone quay on the northern side, from which the islands are visible, especially Murano, which is a Venice on a small scale. The intervening lagunes are all alive with little gondolas.\n\nSept. 30. Evening.\nTo-day I have enlarged my notions of Venice by procuring a plan of it. When I had studied it for some time, I ascended the tower of St. Mark, where an unique spectacle is presented to the eye. It was noon, and the sun was so bright that I could see places near and distant without a glass. The tide covered the lagunes, and when I turned my eyes towards what is called the Lido (this is a narrow strip of earth, which bounds the lagunes), I saw the sea for the first time with some sails upon it. In the lagunes themselves some gallies and frigates are lying, destined to join the Chevalier Emo, who is making war on the Algerines, but detained by unfavorable winds. The mountains of Padua and Vicenza, and the mountain-chain of Tyrol, beautifully bound the picture between the north and west.\n\nOctober 1.\nI went out and surveyed the city from many points of view, and as it was Sunday, I was struck by the great want of cleanliness in the streets, which forced me to make some reflections. There seems to be a sort of policy in this matter, for the people scrape the sweepings into the corners, and I see large ships going backwards and forwards, which at several points He to, and take off the accumulation. They belong to the people of the surrounding islands, who are in want of manure. But, however, there is neither consistency nor strictness in this method, and the want of cleanliness in the city is the more unpardonable, as in it, as much provision has been made for cleaning it, as in any Dutch town.\nAll the streets are paved—even those in the remotest quarters, with bricks at least, which are laid down lengthwise, with the edges slightly canting: the middle of the street where necessary is raised a little, while channels are formed on each side to receive the water, and convey it into covered drains. There are other architectural arrangements in the original well-considered plan, which prove the intention of the excellent architects to make Venice the most cleanly, as well as the most singular of cities. As I walked along I could not refrain from sketching a body of regulations on the subject, anticipating in thought some superintendent of police, who might act in earnest. Thus one always feels an inclination to sweep one's neighbour's door.\n\nOct. 2, 1786.\nBefore all things I hastened to the Carità. I had found in Palladio's works that he had planned a monastic building here, in which he intended to represent a private residence of the rich and hospitable ancients. The plan, which was excellently drawn, both as a whole and in detail, gave me infinite delight, and I hoped to find a marvel. Alas! scarcely a tenth part of the edifice is finished. However, even this part is worthy of that heavenly genius. There is a completeness in the plan, and an accuracy in the execution, which I had never before witnessed. One ought to pass whole years in the contemplation of such a work. It seems to me that I have seen nothing grander, nothing more perfect, and I fancy that I am not mistaken. Only imagine the admirable artist, born with an inner feeling for the grand and the pleasing, now, for the first time, forming himself by the ancients, with incredible labour, that he may be the means of reviving them. He finds an opportunity to carry out a favorite thought in building a convent, which is destined as a dwelling for so many monks, and a shelter for so many strangers, in the form of an antique private residence.\nThe church was already standing and led to an atrium of Corinthian columns. Here one feels delighted, and forgets all priestcraft. At one end, the sacristy, at another, a chapter-room is found, while there is the finest winding stair-case in the world, with a wide well, and the stone-steps built into the wall, and so laid, that one supports another. One is never tired of going up and down this stair-case, and we may judge of its success, from the fact that Palladio himself declares that he has succeeded. The fore-court leads to the large inner-court. Unfortunately, nothing is finished of the building which was to surround this, except the left side. Here there are three rows of columns, one over the other; on the ground-floor are the halls, on the first story is an archway in front of the cells, and the upper story consists of a plain wall with windows. However, this description should be illustrated by a reference to the sketches. I will just add a word about the execution.\nOnly the capitals and bases of the columns, and the key-stones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is—I will not say of brick, but-of burned clay. This description of tile I never saw before. The frieze and cornice are of the same material, as well as the parts of the arch. All is but half burnt, and lastly the building is put together with a very little lime. As it stands it looks as if it had been produced at one cast. If the whole had been finished, and it had been properly rubbed up and coloured, it would have been a charming sight.\nHowever, as so often happens with buildings of a modern time, the plan was too large. The artist had pre-supposed not only that the existing convent would be pulled down, but also that the adjoining houses would be bought, and here money and inclination probably began to fail. Kind Destiny, thou who hast formed and perpetuated so much stupidity, why didst thou not allow this work to be completed!\n\nOct. 3.\nThe church Il Redentore is a large and beautiful work by Palladio, with a façade even more worthy of praise than that of S. Giorgio. These works, which have often been engraved, must be placed before you, to elucidate what is said. I will only add a few words.\nPalladio was thoroughly imbued with the antique mode of existence, and felt the narrow, petty spirit of his own age, like a great man who will not give way to it, but strives to mould all that it leaves him, as far as possible, into accordance with his own ideas. From a slight perusal of his book I conclude that he was displeased with the continued practice of building Christian churches after the form of the ancient Basilica, and, therefore, sought to make his own sacred edifices approximate to the form of the antique temple. Hence arose certain discrepancies, which, as it seemed to me, are happily avoided in Il Redentore, but are rather obvious in the S. Giorgio. Volckmann says something about it, but does not hit the nail on the head.\nThe interior of Il Redentore is likewise admirable. Everything, including even the designs of the altars, is by Palladio. Unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are glaring with wooden figures, flat, carved, and painted.\n\nOctober 3.\nIn honour of S. Francis, S. Peter's capuchins have splendidly adorned a side altar. There was nothing to be seen of stone but the Corinthian capitals; all the rest seemed to be covered with tasteful but splendid embroidery, in the arabesque style, and the effect was as pretty as could be desired. I particularly admired the broad tendrils and foliage, embroidered in gold. Going nearer, I discovered an ingenious deception. All that I had taken for gold was, in fact, straw pressed flat, and glued upon paper, according to some beautiful outlines, while the ground was painted with lively colours. This is done with such variety and tact, that the design, which was probably worked in the convent itself, with a material that was worth nothing, must have cost several thousand dollars, if the material had been genuine. It might on occasion be advantageously imitated.\nOn one of the quays, and in front of the water I have often remarked a little fellow telling stories in the Venetian dialect, to a greater or less concourse of auditors. Unfortunately I cannot understand a word, but I observe that no one laughs, though the audience, who are composed of the lowest class, occasionally smile. There is nothing striking or ridiculous in the man's appearance, but, on the contrary, something very sedate, with such admirable variety and precision in his gestures, that they evince art and reflection.\n\nOctober 3.\nWith my plan in my hand I endeavored to find my way through the strangest labyrinth to the church of the Mendicanti. Here is the conservatorium, which stands in the highest repute at the present day. The ladies performed an oratorio behind the grating, the church was filled with hearers, the music was very beautiful, and the voices were magnificent. An alto sung the part of King Saul, the chief personage in the poem. Of such a voice I had no notion whatever; some passages of the music were excessively beautiful, and the words, which were Latin, most laughably Italianized in some places, were perfectly adapted for singing. Music here has a wide field.\nThe performance would have been a source of great enjoyment, if the accursed Maestro di Capella had not beaten time with a roll of music against the grating, as conspicuously as if he had to do with school-boys, whom he was instructing. As the girls had repeated the piece often enough, his noise was quite unnecessary, and destroyed all impression, as much as he would, who, in order to make a beautiful statue intelligible to us, should stick scarlet patches on the joints. The foreign sound destroys all harmony. Now this man is a musician, and yet he seems not to be sensible of this; or, more properly speaking, he chooses to let his presence be known by an impropriety, when it would have been much better to allow his value to be perceived by the perfection of the execution. I know that this is the fault of the French, but I did not give the Italians credit for it, and yet the public seems accustomed to it. This is not the first time that that which spoils enjoyment, has been supposed to belong directly to it.\n\nOctober 3.\nYesterday evening I went to the Opera at the S. Moses (for the theatres take their name from the church to which they lie nearest); nothing very delightful! In the plan, the music, and the singers, that energy was wanting, which alone can elevate opera to the highest point. One could not say of any part that it was bad, but the two female actresses alone took pains, not so much to act well, but to set themselves off and to please. That is something, after all. These two actresses have beautiful figures, and good voices, and are nice, lively, compact, little bodies. Among the men, on the other hand, there is no trace of national power, or even of pleasure, in working on the imaginations of their audience. Neither is there among them any voice of decided brilliancy.\nThe ballet, which was wretchedly conceived, was condemned as a whole, but some excellent dancers and danseuses, the latter of whom considered it their duty to make the spectators acquainted with all their person charms, were heartily applauded.\n\nOctober 5.\nTo-day, however, I saw another comedy, which gave me more pleasure. In the ducal palace I heard the public discussion of a law case. It was important, and, happily for me, was brought forward in the holidays. One of the advocates had all the qualifications for an exaggerated buffo. His figure was short and fat, but supple; in profile his features were monstrously prominent. He had a stentorian voice, and a vehemence as if everything that he said came in earnest from the very bottom of his heart. I call this a comedy, because, probably, everything had been already prepared when the public exhibition took place. The judges knew what they had to say, and the parties what they had to expect. However, this plan pleases me infinitely more than our hobbling law affairs. I will endeavor to give some notion of the particulars, and of the neat, natural, and unostentatious manner in which everything takes place.\nIn a spacious hall of the palace the judges were sitting on one side, in a half circle. Opposite to them, in a tribune which could hold several persons, were the advocates for both parties; and upon a bench immediately in front of them, the plantiff, and defendant in person. The advocate for the plaintiff had descended from the tribune, since there was to be no controversy at this day's sitting. All the documents, on both sides, were to be read, although they were already printed.\nA lean clerk, in a black scanty gown, and with a thick bundle in his hand, prepared to perform the office of a reader. The hall was completely crammed with persons who came to see and to hear. The point of law itself, and the persons whom it concerned, must have appeared highly important to the Venetians.\nTrust-estates are so decidedly secured in Venice, that a property once stamped with this character, preserves it for ever, though it may have been divested ages ago by appropriations or other circumstances, and though it may have passed through ever so many hands. When the matter comes into dispute the descendants of the first family recover their right, and the property must be delivered up.\nOn this occasion the discussion was highly important, for the action was brought against the doge himself, or rather against his wife, who veiled by her zendal, or little hood, sat only at a little distance from the plaintiff. She was a lady of a certain age, of noble stature, and with well-formed features, in which there was something of an earnest, not to say fretful character. The Venetians make it a great boast that the princess in her own palace, is obliged to appear before them and the tribunal.\nWhen the clerk began to read, I for the first time clearly discerned the business of a little man who sat on a low stool behind a small table opposite the judges, and near the advocates. More especially I learned the use of an hour-glass, which was placed before him. As long as the clerk reads, time is not heeded, but the advocate is only allowed a certain time, if he speaks in the course of the reading. The clerk reads, and the hour-glass lies in a horizontal position, with the little man's hand upon it. As soon as the advocate opens his mouth, the glass is raised, and sinks again, as soon as he is silent. It is the great duty of the advocate to make remarks on what is read, to introduce cursory observations in order to excite and challenge attention. This puts the little Saturn in a state of the greatest perplexity. He is obliged every moment to change the horizontal and vertical position of the glass, and finds himself in the situation of the evil spirits in the puppet-show, who by the quickly varying \"Berliche, Berloche\" of the mischievous Hanswurst[4], are puzzled whether they are to come or to go.\nWhoever has heard documents read over in a law-court, can imagine the reading on this occasion,—quick and monotonous, but plain and articulate enough. The ingenious advocate contrives to interrupt the tedium by jests, and the public shows its delight in his jokes by immoderate laughter. I must mention one, the most striking of those I could understand. The reader was just reciting the document, by which, one, who was considered to have been illegally possessed of it, had disposed of the property in question. The advocate bade him lead more slowly, and when he plainly uttered the words: \"I give and bequeath,\" the orator flew violently at the clerk and cried: \"What will you give? What will you bequeath? you poor starved-out devil, nothing in the world belongs to you?\" \"However,\"—he continued, as he seemed to collect himself—\"the illustrious owner was in the same predicament. He wished to give, he wished to bequeath that which belonged to him no more than to you.\" A burst of inextinguishable laughter followed this sally, but the hour-glass at once resumed its horizontal position. The reader went mumbling on, and made a saucy face at the advocate; but all these jokes are prepared beforehand.\n[4]\nAn allusion to the comic scene, in the puppet-play of Faust, from which Göethe took the subject of his poem. One of the two magic words (Berliche, Berloche) summons the devils, the other drives them away, and the Hanswurst (or buffoon), in a mock-incantation scene, perplexes the fiends, by uttering one word after the other, as rapidly as possible.—Trans.\n\nOct. 4.\nI was yesterday at the play, in the theatre of S. Luke, and was highly pleased. I saw a piece acted extempore in masks, with a great deal of nature, energy, and vigour. The actors are not, indeed, all equal; the pantaloon is excellent, and one of the actresses, who is stout and well-built, speaks admirably, and deports herself cleverly, though she is no extraordinary actress. The subject of the piece is extravagant, and resembled that which is treated by us under the name of Der Verschlag (the partition). With inexhaustible variety it amused us for more than three hours. But even here the people is the base upon which everything rests, the spectators are themselves actors, and the multitude is melted into one whole with the stage. All day long the buyer and the seller, the beggar, the sailor, the female gossip, the advocate and his opponent, are living and acting in the square and on the bench, in the gondolas and in the palaces, and make it their business to talk and to asseverate, to cry and to offer for sale, to sing and to play, to curse and to brawl. In the evening they go into the theatre, and see and hear the life of the day artificially put together, prettily set off, interwoven with a story, removed from reality by the masks, and brought near to it by manners. In all this they take a childish delight and again shout and clap, and make a noise. From day to night,—nay, from midnight to midnight, it is always the same.\nI have not often seen more natural acting than that by these masks. It is such acting as can only be sustained by a remarkably happy talent and long practice.\nWhile I am writing this, they are making a tremendous noise on the canal under my window, though it is past midnight. Whether for good or for evil, they are always doing something.\n\nOctober 4.\nI have now heard public orators; viz., three fellows in the square and on the stone-bench, each telling tales after his fashion, two advocates, two preachers, and the actors, among whom I must especially commend the pantaloon. All these have something in common, both because they belong to one and the same nation, which, as it always lives in public, always adopts an impassioned manner of speaking, and because they imitate each other. There is besides a marked language of gesticulations, with which they accompany the expressions of their intentions, views, and feelings.\nThis day was the festival of S. Francis, and I was in his church Alle Vigne. The loud voice of the capuchin was accompanied by the cries of the salesmen in front of the church, as by an antiphone. I stood at the church-door between the two, and the effect was singular enough.\n\nOct. 5.\nThis morning I was in the arsenal, which I found interesting enough, though I know nothing of maritime affairs, and visited the lower school there. It has an appearance like that of an old family, which still bustles about, although its best time of blossom and fruit has passed. By paying attention to the handicraftsmen, I have seen much that is remarkable, and have been on board an eighty-four gun ship, the hull of which is just completed.\nSix months ago a thing of the sort was burned down to the water's edge, off the Riva dei Schiavoni. The powder-room was not very full, and when it blew up, it did no great damage. The windows of the neighbouring houses were destroyed.\nI have seen worked the finest oak from Istria, and have made my observations in return upon this valuable tree. That knowledge of the natural things used by man as materials, and employed for his wants, which I have acquired with so much difficulty, has been incalculably serviceable in explaining to me the proceedings of artists and artisans. The knowledge of mountains and of the stone taken out of them has been to me a great advance in art.\n\nOct. 5.\nTo give a notion of the Bucentaur in one word, I should say that it is a state-galley. The older one, of which we still have drawings, justified this appellation still more than the present one, which, by its splendour makes us forget its original.\nI am always returning to my old opinions. When a genuine subject is given to an artist, his productions will be something genuine also. Here the artist was commissioned to form a galley, worthy to carry the heads of the Republic, on the highest festivals in honour of its ancient rule on the sea; and the problem has been admirably solved. The vessel is all ornament; we ought to say, it is overladen with ornament; it is altogether one piece of gilt carving, for no other use, but that of a pageant to exhibit to the people its leaders in right noble style. We know well enough that a people, who likes to deck out its boats, is no less pleased to see their rulers bravely adorned. This state-galley is a good index to show what the Venetians were, and what they considered themselves.\n\nOct. 5. Night.\nI came home laughing from a tragedy, and must at once make the jest secure upon paper. The piece was not bad, the author had brought together all the tragic matadors, and the actors played well. Most of the situations were well known, but some were new and highly felicitous. There are two fathers, who hate each other, sons and daughters of these severed families, who respectively are passionately in love with each other, and one couple is even privately married. Wild and cruel work goes on, and at last nothing remains to render the young people happy, but to make the two fathers kill each other, upon which the curtain falls amid the liveliest applause. Now the applause becomes more vehement, now \"fuora\" was called out, and this lasted until the two principal couples vouchsafed to crawl forward from behind the curtain, make their bow, and retire at the opposite side.\nThe public was not yet satisfied, but went on clapping and crying: \"i morti!\" till the two dead men also come forward and made their bow, when some voices cried \"bravi i morti!\" The applause detained them for a long time, till at last they were allowed to depart. The effect is infinitely more droll to the eye-and-ear-witness, who, like me, has ringing in his ears the \"bravo! bravi!\" which the Italians have incessantly in their mouths, and then suddenly hears the dead also called forward with this word of honour.\nWe of the north can say \"good night\" at any hour, when we take leave after dark, but the Italian says: \"Felicissima notte\" only once, and that is when the candles are brought into a room. Day and night are thus divided, and something quite different is meant. So impossible is it to translate the idioms of any language! From the highest to the lowest word all has reference to the peculiarities of the natives, in character, opinions, or circumstances.\n\nOct. 6.\nThe tragedy yesterday taught me a great deal. In the first place, I have heard how the Italians treat and declaim their Eleven-syllable iambics, and in the next place, I have understood the tact of Gozzi in combining masks with his tragic personages. This is the proper sort of play for this people, which likes to be moved in a rough fashion. It has no tender, heart-felt sympathy for the unfortunate personage, but is only pleased when the hero speaks well. The Italians attach a great deal of importance to the speaking, and then they like to laugh, or to hear something silly.\nTheir interest in the drama is like that in a real event. When the tyrant gave his son a sword and required him to kill his own wife, who was standing opposite, the people began loudly to express their disapprobation of this demand, and there was a great risk that the piece would have been interrupted. They insisted that the old man should take his sword back, in which case all the subsequent situations in the drama would have been completely spoiled. At last, the distressed son plucked up courage, advanced to the proscenium, and humbly entreated that the audience would have patience for a moment, assuring them that all would turn out to their entire satisfaction. But even judging from an artistical point of view, this situation was, under the circumstances, silly and unnatural, and I commended the people for their feeling.\nI can now better understand the long speeches and the frequent dissertations, pro and con, in the Greek tragedy. The Athenians liked still more to hear speaking, and were still better judges of it, than the Italians. They learned something from the courts of law, where they spent the whole day.\n\nOct. 6.\nIn those works of Palladio, which are completed, I have found much to blame, together with much that is highly valuable. While I was thinking it over in my mind how far I was right or wrong in setting my judgment in opposition to that of so extraordinary a man, I felt as if he stood by and said, \"I did so and so against my will, but, nevertheless, I did it, because in this manner alone was it possible for me, under the given circumstances, to approximate to my highest idea.\" The more I think the matter over, it seems to me, that Palladio, while contemplating the height and width of an already existing church, or of an old house to which he was to attach facades, only considered: \"How will you give the greatest form to these dimensions? Some part of the detail must from the necessity of the case, be put out of its place or spoiled, and something unseemly is sure to arise here and there. Be that as it may, the whole will have a grand style, and you will be pleased with your work.\"\nAnd thus he carried out the great image which he had within his soul, just to the point where it was not quite suitable, and where he was obliged in the detail to mutilate or to overcrowd it.\nOn the other hand, the wing of the Carità cannot be too highly prized, for here the artist's hands were free, and he could follow the bent of his own mind without constraint. If the convent were finished there would, perhaps, be no work of architecture more perfect throughout the present world.\nHow he thought and how he worked becomes more and more clear to me, the more I read his works, and reflect how he treated the ancients; for he says few words, but they are all important. The fourth book, which illustrates the antique temples, is a good introduction to a judicious examination of ancient remains.\n\nOct. 6.\nYesterday evening I saw the Electra of Crebillon—that is to say, a translation—at the theatre S. Crisostomo. I cannot say, how absurd the piece appeared to me, and how terribly it tired me out.\nThe actors are generally good, and know how to put off the public with single passages.\nOrestes alone has three narratives, poetically set off, in one scene. Electra, a pretty little woman of the middle size and stature, with almost French vivacity, and with a good deportment, delivered the verses beautifully, only she acted the part madly from beginning to end, which, alas! it requires. However, I have again learned something. The Italian Iambic, which is invariably of eleven syllables, is very inconvenient for declamation, because the last syllable is always short, and causes an elevation of the voice against the will of the declaimer.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis morning I was present at high mass, which annually on this day the Doge must attend, in the church of St. Justina, to commemorate an old victory over the Turks. When the gilded barks, which carry the princes and a portion of the nobility approach the little square, when the boatmen, in their rare liveries, are plying their red-painted oars, when on the shore the clergy and the religious fraternities are standing, pushing, moving about, and waiting with their lighted torches fixed upon poles and portable silver chandeliers; then, when the gangways covered with carpet are placed from the vessels to the shore, and first the full violet dresses of the Savii, next the ample red robes of the Senators are unfolded upon the pavement, and lastly when the old Doge adorned with his golden Phrygian cap, in his long golden talar and his ermine cloak, steps out of the vessel—when all this, I say, takes place in a little square before the portal of a church, one feels as if one were looking at an old worked tapestry, exceedingly well designed and coloured. To me, northern fugitive as I am, this ceremony gave a great deal of pleasure. With us, who parade nothing but short coats in our processions of pomp, and who conceive nothing greater than one performed with shouldered arms, such an affair might be out of place. But these trains, these peaceful celebrations are all in keeping here.\nThe Doge is a well-grown and well-shaped man, who, perhaps, suffers from ill health, but, nevertheless, for dignity's sake, bears himself upright under his heavy robe. In other respects he looks like the grandpapa of the whole race, and is kind and affable. His dress is very becoming, the little cap, which he wears under the large one, does not offend the eye, resting as it does upon the whitest and finest hair in the world.\nAbout fifty nobili, with long dark-red trains, were with him. For the most part they were handsome men, and there was not a single uncouth figure among them. Several of them were tall with large heads, so that the white curly wigs were very becoming to them. Their features are prominent; the flesh of their faces is soft and white, without looking flabby and disagreeable. On the contrary, there is an appearance of talent without exertion, repose, self-confidence, easiness of existence, and a certain joyousness-pervades the whole.\nWhen all had taken their places in the church, and mass began, the fraternities entered by the chief door, and went out at the side door to the right, after they had received holy water in couples, and made their obeisance to the high altar, to the Doge, and the nobility.\n\nOct. 6.\nThis evening I bespoke the celebrated song of the mariners, who chaunt Tasso and Ariosto to melodies of their own. This must actually be ordered, as it is not to be beard as a thing, of course, but rather belongs to the half forgotten traditions of former times. I entered a gondola by moon-light, with one singer before and the other behind me. They sing their song taking up the verses alternately. The melody, which we know through Rousseau, is of a middle kind, between choral and recitative, maintaining throughout the same cadence, with out any fixed time. The modulation is also uniform, only varying with a sort of declamation both tone and measure, according to the subject of the verse. But the spirit—the life of it, is as follows:—\nWithout inquiring into the construction of the melody, suffice it to say that it is admirably suited to that easy class of people, who, always humming something or other to themselves, adapt such tunes to any little poem they know by heart.\nSitting on the shore of an island, on the bank of a canal, or on the side of a boat, a gondolier will sing away with a loud penetrating voice—the multitude admire force above everything—anxious only to be heard as far as possible. Over the silent mirror it travels far. Another in the distance, who is acquainted with the melody and knows the words, takes it up and answers with the next verse, and then the first replies, so that the one is as it were the echo of the other. The song continues through whole nights and is kept up without fatigue. The further the singers are from each other, the more touching sounds the strain. The best place for the listener is halfway between the two.\nIn order to let me hear it, they landed on the bank of the Guidecca, and took up different positions by the canal. I walked backwards and forwards between them, so as to leave the one whose turn it was to sing, and to join the one who had just left off. Then it was that the effect of the strain first opened upon me. As a voice from the distance it sounds in the highest degree strange—as a lament without sadness: it has an incredible effect and is moving even to tears. I ascribed this to my own state of mind, but my old boatsman said: \"è singolare, como quel canto intenerisce, e molto piu quando è piu ben cantato.\" He wished that I could hear the women of the Lido, especially those of Malamocco, and Pelestrina. These also, he told me, chanted Tasso and Ariosto to the same or similar melodies. He went on: \"in the evening, while their husbands are on the sea fishing, they are accustomed to sit on the beach, and with shrill-penetrating voice to make these strains resound, until they catch from the distance the voices of their partners, and in this way they keep up a communication with them.\" Is not that beautiful? and yet, it is very possible that one who heard them close by, would take little pleasure in such tones which have to vie with the waves of the sea. Human, however, and true becomes the song in this way: thus is life given to the melody, on whose dead elements we should otherwise have been sadly puzzled. It is the song of one solitary, singing at a distance, in the hope that another of kindred feelings and sentiments may hear and answer.\n\nVenice, Oct. 8, 1786.\nI paid a visit to the palace Pisani Moretta, for the sake of a charming picture by Paul Veronese. The females of the family of Darius are represented kneeling before Alexander and Hephæstion; his mother, who is in the foreground, mistakes Hephæstion for the king;—turning away from her he points to Alexander. A strange story is told about this painting; the artist had been well received and for a long time honorably entertained in the palace; in return he secretly painted the picture and left it behind him as a present, rolled up under his bed. Certainly it well deserves to have had a singular origin, for it gives an idea of all the peculiar merits of this master. The great art with which he manages by a skilful distribution of light and shade, and by an equally clever contrast of the local colors, to produce a most delightful harmony without throwing any sameness of tone over the whole picture, is here most strikingly visible. For the picture is in excellent preservation, and stands before us almost with the freshness of yesterday.—Indeed, whenever a painting of this order has suffered from neglect, our enjoyment of it is marred on the spot, even before we are conscious what the cause may be.\nWhoever feels disposed to quarrel with the artist on the score of costume has only to say he ought to have painted a scene of the sixteenth century; and the matter is at an end. The gradation in the expression from the mother through the wife to the daughters, is in the highest degree true and happy. The youngest princess, who kneels behind all the rest, is a beautiful girl, and has a very pretty, but somewhat independent and haughty countenance. Her position does not at all seem to please her.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nMy old gift of seeing the world with the eyes of that artist, whose pictures have most recently made an impression on me, has occasioned me some peculiar reflections. It is evident that the eye forms itself by the objects, which, from youth up, it is accustomed to look upon, and so the Venetian artist must see all things in a clearer and brighter light than other men. We, whose eye when out of doors, falls on a dingy soil, which, when not muddy, is dusty,—and which, always colourless, gives a sombre hue to the reflected rays, or at home spend our lives in close, narrow rooms, can never attain to such a cheerful view of nature.\nAs I floated down the lagunes in the full sunshine, and observed how the figures of the gondoliers in their motley costume, and as they rowed, lightly moving above the sides of the gondola, stood out from the bright green surface and against the blue sky, I caught the best and freshest type possible of the Venetian school. The sunshine brought out the local colours with dazzling brilliancy, and the shades even were so luminous, that, comparatively, they in their turn might serve as lights. And the same may be said of the reflection from the sea-green water. All was painted \"chiaro nell chiaro,\" so that foamy waves and lightning flashes were necessary to give it a grand finish (um die Tüpfchen auf sie zu setzen).\nTitian and Paul have this brilliancy in the highest degree, and whenever we do not find it in any of their works, the piece is either damaged or has been touched up.\nThe cupola and vaulting of St. Mark's, with its side-walls,—are covered with paintings—a mass of richly colored figures on a golden ground; all in mosaic work: some of them very good, others but poor, according to the masters who furnished the cartoons.\nCircumstances here have strangely impressed on my mind how everything depends on the first invention, and that this constitutes the right standard—the true genius—since with little square-pieces of glass (and here not in the soberest manner), it is possible to imitate the good as well as the bad. The art which furnished to the ancients their pavements, and to the Christians the vaulted ceilings of their churches, fritters itself away in our days on snuff-box lids and bracelets-clasps. The present times are worse even than one thinks.\n\nVenice, October 8, 1786.\nIn the Farsetti palace there is a valuable collection of casts from the best antiques. I pass over all such as I had seen before at Mannheim or elsewhere, and mention only new acquaintances. A Cleopatra in intense repose, with the asp coiled round her arm, and sinking into the sleep of death;—a Niobe shrouding with her robe her youngest daughter from the arrows of Apollo;—some gladiators;—a winged genius, resting in his flight;—some philosophers, both in sitting and standing postures.\nThey are works from which, for thousands of years to come, the world may receive delight and instruction, without ever being able to equal with their thanks the merits of the artists.\nMany speaking busts transported me to the old glorious times. Only I felt, alas, how backward I am in these studies; however, I will go on with them—at least I know the way. Palladio has opened the road for me to this and every other art and life. That sounds probably somewhat strange, and yet not so paradoxical as when Jacob Böhme says that, by seeing a pewter platter by a ray from Jupiter, he was enlightened as to the whole universe. There is also in this collection a fragment of the entablature of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina in Rome.\nThe bold front of this noble piece of architecture reminded me of the capitol of the Pantheon at Mannheim. It is, indeed, something very different from our queer saints, piled up one above the other on little consoles after the gothic style of decoration,—something different from our tobacco-pipe-like shafts,—our little steeple-crowned towers, and foliated terminals,—from all taste for these—I am now, thank God, set free for ever!\nI will further mention a few works of statuary, which, as I passed along these last few days, I have observed with astonishment and instruction: before the gate of the arsenal two huge lions of white marble,-the one is half recumbent, raising himself up on his fore-feet,—the other is lying down: noble emblems of the variety of life. They are of such huge proportions, that all around appears little, and man himself would become as nought, did not sublime objects elevate him. They are of the best times of Greece, and were brought here from the Piraeus in the better days of the Republic.\nFrom Athens, too, in all probability, came two bas-reliefs which have been introduced in the church of St. Justina, the conqueress of the Turks. Unfortunately they are in some degree hidden by the church seats. The sacristan called my attention to them on account of the tradition that Titian, modelled from them the beautiful angel in his picture of the martyrdom of St. Peter. The relievos represent genii who are decking themselves out with, the attributes of the gods,—so beautiful in truth, as to transcend all idea or conception.\nNext I contemplated with quite peculiar feelings the naked colossal statue of Marcus Agrippa, in the court of a palace; a dolphin which is twisting itself by his side, points out the naval hero. How does such a heroic representation make the mere man equal to the gods!\nI took a close view of the horses of S. Mark's. Looking up at them from below, it is easy to see that they are spotted: in places they exhibit a beautiful yellow-metallic lustre, in others a coppery green has run over them. Viewing them more closely, one sees distinctly that once they were gilt all over, and long streaks are still to be seen over them, as the barbarians did not attempt to file off the gold, but tried to cut it off. That, too, is well: thus the shape at least has been preserved.\nA glorious team of horses,—I should like to hear the opinion of a good judge of horse-flesh. What seemed strange to me was, that closely viewed, they appear heavy, while from the piazza below they look as light as deer.\n\nOctober 8, 1786.\nYesterday I set out early with my tutelary genius for the \"Lido,\" the tongue of land which shuts in the lagunes, and divides them from the sea. We landed and walked straight across the isthmus. I heard a loud hollow murmur,—it was the sea! I soon saw it: it crested high against the shore, as it retired,—it was about noon, and time of ebb. I have then at last seen the sea with my own eyes, and followed it on its beautiful bed, just as it quitted it. I wished the children had been there to gather the shells; child-like I myself picked up plenty of them; however, I attempted to make them useful; I tried to dry in them some of the fluid of the cuttle fish, which here dart away from you in shoals.\nOn the \"Lido,\" not far from the sea, is the burial place of Englishmen, and a little further on, of the Jews: both alike are refused the privilege of resting in consecrated ground. I found here the tomb of Smith, the noble English consul, and of his first wife. It is to him that I owe my first copy of Palladio; I thanked him for it here in his unconsecrated grave. And not only unconsecrated, but half buried is the tomb. The \"Lido\" is at best but a sand-bank (daune): The sand is carried from it backwards and forwards by the wind, and thrown up in heaps is encroaching on every side. In a short time the monument, which is tolerably high, will no longer be visible.\nBut the sea—it is a grand sight! I will try and get a sail upon it some day in a fishing-boat: the gondolas never venture out so far.\n\nOct. 8, 1786.\nOn the sea-coast I found also several plants, whose characters similar to others I already knew, enabled me to recognize pretty well their properties. They are all alike, fat and strong-full of sap and clammy,—and it is evident that the old salt of the sandy soil, but still more the saline atmosphere, gives them these properties. Like aquatic plants they abound in sap, and are fleshy and tough, like mountainous ones; those whose leaves shew a tendency to put forth prickles, after the manner of thistles, have them extremely sharp and strong. I found a bush with leaves of this kind. It looked very much like our harmless coltsfoot, only here it is armed with sharp weapons,—the leaves like leather, as also are the seed-vessels, and the stalk very thick and succulent. I bring with me seeds and specimens of the leaves. (Eryngium maritimum.)\nThe fish-market, with its numberless marine productions, afforded me much amusement. I often go there to contemplate the poor captive inhabitants of the sea.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nA delicious day from morning to night! I have been towards Chiozza, as far as Pelestrina, where are the great structures, called Murazzi, which the Republic has caused to be raised against the sea. They are of hewn stone, and properly are intended to protect from the fury of the wild element the tongue of land called the Lido, which separates the lagoons from the sea.\nThe lagunes are the work of old nature. First of all, the land and tide, the ebb and flow, working against one another, and then the gradual sinking of the primal waters, were, together, the causes why, at the upper end of the Adriatic, we find a pretty extensive range of marshes, which, covered by the flood-tide, are partly left bare by the ebb. Art took possession of the highest spots, and thus arose Venice, formed out of a groupe of a hundred isles, and surrounded by hundreds more. Moreover, at an incredible expense of money and labour, deep canals have been dug through the marshes, in order that at the time of high water, ships of war might pass to the chief points. What human industry and wit contrived and executed of old, skill and industry must now keep up. The Lido, a long narrow strip of land, separates the lagunes from the sea, which can enter only at two points—at the castle and at the opposite end near Chiozza. The tide flows in usually twice a-day, and with the ebb again carries out the waters twice, and always by the same channel and in the same direction. The flood covers the lower parts of the morass, but leaves the higher, if not dry, yet visible.\nThe case would be quite altered were the sea to make new ways for itself, to attack the tongue of land and flow in and out wherever it chose. Not to mention that the little villages on the Lido, Pelestrina, viz., S. Peter's and others would be overwhelmed, the canals of communication would be choked up, and while the water involved all in ruin, the Lido would be changed into an island, and the islands which now lie behind it be converted into necks and tongues of land. To guard against this it was necessary to protect the Lido as far as possible, lest the furious element should capriciously attack and overthrow what man had already taken possession of, and with a certain end and purpose given shape and use to.\nIn extraordinary cases when the sea rises above measure, it is especially necessary to prevent it entering at more than two points. Accordingly the rest of the sluice-gates being shut, with all its violence it is unable to enter, and in a few hours submits to the law of the ebb, and its fury lessens.\nOtherwise Venice has nothing to fear; the extreme slowness with which the sea-line retires, assures to her thousands of years yet, and by prudently deepening the canals from time to time, they will easily maintain their possessions against the inroads of the water.\nI could only wish that they kept their streets a little cleaner—a duty which is as necessary as it is easy of performance, and which in fact becomes of great consequence in the course of centuries. Even now in the principal thoroughfares it is forbidden to throw anything into the canals: the sweepings even of the streets may not be cast into them. No measures, however, are taken to prevent the rain, which here falls in sudden and violent torrents, from carrying off the dirt which is collected in piles at the corner of every street, and washing it into the lagunes—nay, what is still worse, into the gutters for carrying off the water, which consequently are often so completely stopped up, that the principal squares are in danger of being under water. Even in the smaller piazza of S. Mark's, I have seen the gullies which are well laid down there, as well as in the greater square, choked up and full of water.\nWhen a rainy day comes, the filth is intolerable; every one is cursing and scolding. In ascending and descending the bridges one soils one's mantle and great coat (Tabarro), which is here worn all the year long, and as one goes along in shoes and silk stockings, one gets splashed, and then scolds, for it is not common mud, but mud that adheres and stains that one is here splashed with. The weather soon becomes fine again, and then no one thinks of cleaning the streets. How true is the saying: the public is ever complaining that is ill served, and never knows how to set about getting better served. Here if the sovereign-people wished it, it might be done forthwith.\n\nVenice, Oct. 9, 1786.\nYesterday evening I ascended the tower of S. Mark's: as I had lately seen from its top the lagunes in their glory at flood time, I wished also to see them at low water; for in order to have a correct idea of the place, it is necessary to take in both views. It looks rather strange to see land all around one, where a little before the eye fell upon a mirror of waters. The islands are no longer islands—merely higher and house-crowned spots in one large morass of a gray-greenish colour, and intersected by beautiful canals. The marshy parts are overgrown with aquatic plants, a circumstance which must tend in time to raise their level, although the ebb and flow are continually shaking and tossing them and leave no rest to the vegetation.\nI now turn with my narrative once more to the sea.—I there saw yesterday the haunts of the sea-snails, the limpets, and the crab, and was highly delighted with the sight. What a precious glorious object is a living thing!—how wonderfully adapted to its state of existence, how true, how real (seyend). What great advantages do I not derive now from my former studies of nature, and how delighted am I with the opportunity of continuing them! But as the present is a matter that admits of being communicated to my friends, I will not seek to excite their sympathy merely by exclamations.\nThe stone-works which have been built against the inroads of the sea consist first of all of several steep steps; then comes a slightly inclined plane, then again they rise a step, which is once more succeeded by a gently ascending surface, and last of all comes a perpendicular wall with an overhanging coping—over these steps—over these planes the raging sea rises until in extraordinary cases it even dashes over the highest wall with its projecting head.\nThe sea is followed by its inhabitants;—little periwinkles good to eat, monovalve limpets, and whatever else has the power of motion, especially by the pungar-crabs. But scarcely have these little creatures taken possession of the smooth walls, ere the sea retires again, swelling and cresting as it came. At first the crowd knows not where they are, and keep hoping that the briny flood will soon return to them—but it still keeps away; the sun comes out and quickly dries them up, and now begins the retreat. It is on these occasions that the pungars seek their prey. Nothing more wonderful or comical can be seen than the manœuvres of these little creatures, with their round bodies and two long claws (for the other spider-feet are scarcely worth noticing). On these stilted fore-legs, as it were, they stride along watching the limpets, and as soon as one moves itself under its shell on the rock, a pungar comes up and inserting the point of his claw in the tiny interstice between the shell and the rock turns it over, and so manages to swallow the oyster. The limpets, on the other hand, proceed cautiously on their way, and by suction fasten themselves firmly to the rocky surface as soon as they are aware of the proximity of their foe. In such cases the pungar deports himself amusingly enough; round and round the pulpy animal who keeps himself safe beneath his roof will he go with singular politeness; but not succeeding with all his coaxing and being unable to overcome its powerful muscle, he leaves in despair this intended victim, and hastens after another who may be wandering less cautiously on his way.\nI never saw a crab succeed in his designs, although I have watched for hours the retreat of the little troop as they crawled down the two planes and the intermediate steps.\n\nVenice, Oct. 10, 1786.\nAt last I am able to say that I have seen a comedy; Yesterday at the theatre of St. Luke, was performed \"Le Baruffe-Chiozotte,\" which I should interpret the Frays and Feuds of Chiozza. The \"dramatis personæ,\" are principally seafaring people, inhabitants of Chiozza, with their wives, sisters, and daughters. The usual noisy demonstrations of such sort of people in their good or ill luck—their dealings one with another, their vehemence, but goodness of heart, common-place remarks and unaffected manners, their naïve wit and humour—all this was excellently imitated. The piece, moreover, is Goldoni's, and as I had been only the day before in the place itself, and as the tones and manners of the sailors and people of the sea-port still echoed in my ears and floated before my eyes, it delighted me very much, and although I did not understand a single allusion, I was, nevertheless, on the whole, able to follow it pretty well. I will now give you the plan of the piece:—it opens with the females of Chiozza sitting, as usual, on the strand before their cabins, spinning, mending nets, sewing, or making lace; a youth passes by and notices one of them with a more friendly greeting than the rest. Immediately the joking begins—and observes no bounds; becoming tarter and tarter, and growing ill-tempered it soon bursts out into reproaches; abuse vies with abuse; in the midst of all one dame more vehement than the rest, bounces out with the truth; and now an endless din of scolding, railing, and screaming; there is no lack of more decided outrage, and at last the peace-officers are compelled to interfere.\nThe second act opens with the Court of Justice. In the absence of the Podestà (who as a noble could not lawfully be brought upon the stage) the Actuarius presides. He orders the women to be brought before him one by one. This gives rise to an interesting scene. It happens that this official personage is himself enamoured of the first of the combatants who is brought before him. Only too happy to have an opportunity of speaking with her alone, instead of hearing what she has to say on the matter in question, he makes her a declaration of love. In the midst of it a second woman, who is herself in love with the actuary, in a fit of jealousy rushes in, and with her the suspicious lover of the first damsel—who is followed by all the rest, and now the same demon of confusion riots in the court as a little before, had set at loggerheads the people of the harbour. In the third act the fun gets more and more boisterous, and the whole ends with a hasty and poor denouement. The happiest thought, however, of the whole piece, is a character who is thus drawn,—an old sailor who from the hardships he has been exposed to from his childhood, trembles and falters in all his limbs, and even in his very organs of speech, is brought on the scene to serve as a foil to this restless, screaming, and jabbering crew. Before he can utter a word, he has to make a long preparation by a slow twitching of his lips, and an assistant motion of his hands and arms; at last he blurts out what his thoughts are on the matter in dispute. But as he can only manage to do this in very short sentences, he acquires thereby a sort of laconic gravity, so that all he utters sounds like an adage or maxim; and in this way a happy contrast is afforded to the wild and passionate exclamations of the other personages.\nBut even as it was, I never witnessed anything like the noisy delight the people evinced at seeing themselves and their mates represented with such truth of nature. It was one continued laugh and tumultuous shout of exultation from beginning to end. I must, however, confess that the piece was extremely well acted by the players. According to the cast of their several parts, they had adopted among them the different tones of voice which usually prevail among the inhabitants of the place. The first actress was the universal favorite, more so even than she had recently been in an heroic dress and a scene of passion. The female players generally, but especially this one, in the most pleasing manner possible imitated the twang, the manners, and other peculiarities of the people they represented. Great praise is due to the author, who out of nothing has here created the most amusing divertissement. However, he never could have done it with any other people than his own merry and lighthearted countrymen. The farce is written throughout with a practised hand.\nOf Sacchi's company, for whom Gozzi wrote (but which by-the-by is now broken up), I saw Smeraldina, a short plump figure, full of life, tact, and good humour. With her I saw Brighella—a slight well-made man and an excellent actor, especially in pantomime. These masks which we scarcely know except in the form of mummings, and which to our minds possess neither life nor meaning, succeed here only too well as the creation of the national taste. Here the most distinguished characters, persons of every age and condition, think nothing of dressing themselves out in the strangest costumes, and as for the greater part of the year they are accustomed to wander about in masks, they feel no surprise at seeing the black visors on the stage also.\n\nVenice, October 11, 1786.\nSince solitude, in the midst of a great crowd of human beings, is after all not possible, I have taken up with an old Frenchman, who knows nothing of Italian, and suspects that he is cheated on all hands and taken advantage of, and who, with plenty of letters of recommendation, nevertheless, does not make his way with the good people here. A man of rank, and living in good style, but one whose mind cannot go beyond himself and his own immediate circle—he is perhaps full fifty, and has at home a boy seven years old, of whom he is always anxious to get news. He is travelling through Italy for pleasure, but rapidly—in order to be able to say that he has seen it, but is willing to learn whatever is possible as he hurries along. I have shewn him some civilities, and have given him information about many matters. While I was speaking to him about Venice, he asked me how long I had been here, and when he heard that this was my first visit, and that I had only been here fourteen days, he replied: \"Il paraît que vous n'avez pas perdu votre temps.\" This is the first \"testimonium\" of my good behaviour that I can furnish you. This is the eighth day since he arrived here, and he leaves us to-morrow. It was highly delicious to me, to meet in a strange land with such a regular Versailles'-man. He is now about to quit me! It caused me some surprise to think that any one could ever travel in this temper without a thought for anything beyond himself, and yet he is in his way a polished, sensible, and well conducted person.\n\nVenice, Oct. 12, 1786.\nYesterday at S. Luke's a new piece was acted:—L'Inglicismo in Italia (the English in Italy). As there are many Englishmen living in Italy, it is not unnatural that their ways and habits should excite notice, and I expected to learn from this piece what the Italians thought of their rich and welcome visitors. But it was a total failure. There were, of course, (as is always the case here,) some clever scenes between buffoons, but the rest was cast altogether in too grave and heavy a mould, and yet nob a trace of the English good sense: plenty of the ordinary Italian commonplaces of morality, and those, too, upon the very commonest of topics.\nAnd it did not take: indeed, it was on the very point of being hissed off the stage. The actors felt themselves out of their element—not on the strand of Chiozza. As this was the last piece that I saw here, my enthusiasm for these national representations did not seem likely to be increased by this piece of folly.\nAs I have at last gone through my journal and entered some occasional remarks from my tablets, my proceedings are now enrolled and left to the sentence of my friends. There is, I am conscious, very much in these leaves which I might qualify, enlarge upon, and improve. Let, however, what is written, stand as the memorial of first impressions, which, if not always correct, will nevertheless be ever dear and precious to me. Oh that I could but transmit to my friends a breath merely of this light existence! Verily to the Italian, \"ultramontane\" is a very vague idea; and to me even—\"beyond the Alps,\" rises very obscurely before my mind, although from out of their mists friendly forms are beckoning to me. It is the climate only that seduces me to prefer awhile these lands to those; for birth and habit forge strong fetters. Here, however, I could not live, nor indeed in any place where I had nothing to occupy my mind; but at present novelty furnishes me here with endless occupation. Architecture rises, like an ancient spirit from the tombs, and bids me study its laws just as people do the rules of a dead language, not in order to practise or to take a living joy in them, but only in order to enable myself in the quiet depths of my own mind to do honor to her existence in bygone ages, and her for ever departed glory. As Palladio everywhere refers one to Vitruvius, I have bought an edition of the latter by Galiani; but this folio suffers in my portmanteau as much as my brain does in the study of it. Palladio by his words and works, by his method and way, both of thinking and of executing, has brought Vitruvius home to me and interpreted him far better than the Italian translator ever can. Vitruvius himself is no easy reading; his book is obscurely written, and requires a critical study. Notwithstanding I have read it through cursorily, and it has left on my mind many a glorious impression. To express my meaning better: I read it like a breviary: more out of devotion, than for instruction. Already the days begin to draw in and allow more time for reading and writing.\nGod be praised! whatever from my youth up appeared to me of worth, is beginning once more to be dear to me. How happy do I feel that I can again venture to approach the ancient authors. For now, I may dare tell it—and confess at once my disease and my folly. For many a long year I could not bear to look at a Latin author, or to cast my eye upon anything that might serve to awaken in my mind the thoughts of Italy. If by accident I did so, I suffered the most horrible tortures of mind. It was a frequent joke of Herder's at my expense, that I had learned all my Latin from Spinoza, for he had noticed that this was the only Latin work I ever read; but he was not aware how carefully I was obliged to keep myself from the ancients—how even these abstruse generalities were but cursorily read by me, and even then not without pain. At last matters came to that pitch that even the perusal of Wieland's translation of the Satires made me utterly wretched; scarcely had I read two of them, before I was compelled to lay the book aside.\nHad I not made the resolve, which I am now carrying into effect, I should have been altogether lost—to such a degree of intensity had the desire grown to see these objects with my own eyes. Historical acquaintance with them did me no good;—the things stood only a hand's-breadth away from me; but still they were separated from me by an impenetrable wall. And, in fact, at the present moment, I somehow feel as if this were not the first time that I had seen these things, but as if I were paying a second visit to them. Although I have been but a short time in Venice, I have adapted myself pretty well to the ways of the place, and feel confident that I shall carry away with me, though a very incomplete, yet, nevertheless, clear and true idea of it.\n\nVenice, Oct. 14, 1786. 2 o'clock, morning.\nIn the last moments of my stay here: for I am to start almost immediately with the packet-boat for Ferrara. I quit Venice without reluctance; for to stay here longer with any satisfaction and profit to myself, I must take other steps which would carry me beyond my present plan. Besides everybody is now leaving this city and making for the beautiful gardens and seats on the Terra-Firma; I, however, go away well-loaded, and shall carry along with me its rich, rare, and unique image.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 page story in english that enhances the event contained in:[EVENT_Goethe], keep everything already present and build around it.
