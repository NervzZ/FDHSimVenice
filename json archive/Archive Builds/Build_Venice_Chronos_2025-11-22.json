      "content": "\nSimulation Data Sheet: The Great Council of Venice (1740)\n\n\nDocument Objective\n\nThis document serves as a knowledge base for a text-based simulation (LLM). It details the mechanics, atmosphere, and procedures of the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council) in 1740, based on the institutional analysis of Amelot de La Houssaye and historical data regarding the daily life of the Republic.\n\n1. The Space: La Sala del Maggior Consiglio\n\nFor the simulation, the space acts as a constraining environment that dictates movement and social interaction.\n\nArchitecture and Symbolism\n\nDimensions: A massive hall (53m x 25m) free of supporting columns, capable of holding between 1,000 and 2,000 patricians.\nThe Ceiling: Heavy with gold leaf and paintings (notably Veronese’s The Triumph of Venice). It serves as a constant reminder of the divine and state hierarchy.\nThe East Wall (Il Paradiso): Dominated by Tintoretto’s immense canvas, located above the Signoria's tribune. By 1740, the painting had darkened with time, creating a severe backdrop behind the Doge.\nThe Tribune (La Signoria): A raised platform where the Doge, his six counselors, and the three chiefs of the Quarantia sit. They physically overlook the assembly.\nThe Benches (Banchi): Arranged in double rows parallel to the walls, leaving a vast central aisle empty for voting procedures.1\n\nAnnexed Spaces (Crucial for Intrigue)\n\nThe Liagò: A closed loggia or terrace adjacent to the hall. It is a \"decompression\" zone where nobles withdraw to speak freely, negotiate votes away from the Signoria’s gaze, or escape the stifling air of the main hall.2\nThe Sala dello Scrutinio: An adjacent hall often used for counting votes or secondary balloting procedures.3\n\nSensory Atmosphere\n\nAcoustics: The sheer volume of the hall and the number of participants create a constant background hum (buzzing). Official readings by the Chancellor are often inaudible to those seated at the far ends.\nLight and Temperature: The hall is lit by large windows facing the lagoon. In winter, it is notoriously freezing (nobles keep their fur-lined cloaks on). In summer, the heat and the proximity of bodies make the air oppressive.4\n\n2. The Actors: Patrician Sociology (1740)\n\nThe simulation must distinguish between three classes of nobles, who are legally equal but economically and politically divided.\n\nThe Three Classes\n\nThe \"Case Vecchie\" and the Rich: Historic families or immense new fortunes. They monopolize high executive offices (Savi, Council of Ten, Ambassadors). They use the Great Council to validate their power, though real decisions are made in the Senate.5\nThe Middle Nobility: They aim for judicial (Quarantie) and administrative offices. They are often legalistic and attached to procedure.\nThe Barnabotti (The Noble Plebs):\nDefinition: Impoverished nobles, often living in the parish of San Barnaba. They have lost their fortunes but retain their vote in the Council.6\nRole in Simulation: They constitute an electoral maneuver mass. Barred from trade and manual labor, their only \"commodity\" is their vote. They are known to be unruly and to sell their suffrage in exchange for informal gratuities (protection, loans, meals).7\n\nCostume (Visual Code)\n\nThe Vesta (Toga): Mandatory for all. A long black gown with large sleeves (a comito). In winter, it is lined with fur; in summer, it is made of light silk.9\nThe Stola (Stole): A band of black cloth worn over the left shoulder. Its width and lining indicate rank (ordinary for a simple noble, wide and fur-lined for Senators and Councilors).10\nThe Wig: By 1740, the use of the powdered wig is generalized, creating an anachronistic contrast between the medieval costume (toga) and the Rococo hairstyle. High, voluminous wigs are a sign of fashion and wealth.\n\n3. The Political Ritual\n\n\nBefore the Session: The Broglio\n\nLocation: The Piazzetta San Marco, before the bell rings.\nAction: This is the time for electoral solicitation. Candidates (\"solicitors\") stand on one side, electors on the other.12\nGestures: Open campaigning is forbidden by law. Everything occurs through codes of exaggerated politeness: deep bows, kissing of the sleeve or stole, and whispered requests for support (\"Mi raccomando\").12\nThe Trottiera: The specific bell that announces the imminent start of the session, urging latecomers to hasten to the palace.4\n\nDuring the Session: Voting and Chance\n\nThe Venetian system, detailed by Amelot de La Houssaye, relies on a complex mix of Sortition (to prevent factions) and Election (to ensure competence).\n\nThe Tools\n\nThe Ballottino: A boy aged 8 to 10, often dressed in white, tasked with drawing balls from the urns to guarantee the innocence of chance.3\nThe Bussole (Urns): Wooden structures allowing for secret voting. The noble inserts his hand and drops his ball into a hidden tube (the \"Yes\" tube or \"No\" tube).\nThe Balls (Balote): Small balls made of compressed linen (for silence).\nGold: Winning ball (for sortition).\nSilver: Losing ball.\nWhite / Red (or Green): Used for voting \"Yes\" or \"No\" during legislative or judicial scrutinies.3\n\nThe \"Four Hands\" Procedure (Election of Magistrates)\n\nThis is the standard procedure for electing state officials.14\nThe Sortition: Each noble passes before an urn. The Ballottino draws a ball for him. If he gets a Gold ball, he becomes an Elector. This continues until 36 electors are chosen.14\nThe Division: The 36 electors are isolated and divided into 4 groups of 9, called \"Hands\" (Mani).\nThe Nomination (Secret): Each \"Hand,\" isolated in a separate room, must agree (by a majority of 6 out of 9) to propose one candidate for the vacant post.\nThe General Ballot: The 4 names proposed (one by each \"Hand\") are announced to the Great Council. The entire assembly then votes for or against each candidate. The one with the most votes wins.14\n\n4. Simulation Data Cards\n\n\nCard A: Sequence of Actions (Sunday Routine)\n\n10:00 AM - Broglio: Social interaction on the Piazza. Informal negotiations.\n10:30 AM - Trottiera: Sound signal. Crowd movement towards the Giants' Staircase.\n11:00 AM - Installation: Entry into the hall. Barnabotti seek strategic seats or cluster together.\n11:30 AM - Reading: The Chancellor reads the list of vacant posts. Ambient hubbub.\n12:00 PM - Lottery (Ballottino): Slow procession before the urn. Tension of the Gold/Silver draw.\n1:00 PM - Conclave of the 4 Hands: Session suspension for the 36 electors. Others wait, chat in the Liagò.\n2:00 PM - Final Vote: Procession to the Bussole to validate candidates.\n\nCard B: Tension Variables\n\nThese modifiers can be used to generate incidents or intrigues in the simulation.\nCold/Heat: Impatience factor. Can push nobles to rush a vote or leave the session early (if the quorum is not threatened).\nVote Selling: A player may be approached by an agent of a rich family: \"A dinner invitation in exchange for a white ball for candidate Cornaro.\"6\nProcedural Error: If the Ballottino makes a mistake or an urn is improperly closed, the Quarantie (judges) must intervene, creating a dramatic interruption.\n\n5.

Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

September  iyS6. \r\n\r\nFRÜH  drei  Uhr  stahl  ich  mich  aus  Karlsbad,  weil  man \r\nmich  sonst  nicht  fortgelassen  hätte.  Die  Gesell- \r\nschaft, die  den  achtundzwanzigsten  August,  mei- \r\nnen Geburtstag,  auf  eine  sehr  freundliche  Weise  feiern \r\nmochte,  erwarb  sich  wohl  dadurch  ein  Recht,  mich  fest- \r\nzuhalten; allein  hier  war  nicht  länger  zu  säumen.  Ich \r\nwarf  mich,  ganz  allein,  nur  einen  Mantelsack  und  Dachs - \r\nranzen  aufpackend,  in  eine  Postchaise  und  gelangte  halb \r\nacht  Uhr  nach  Zwoda,  an  einem  schönen  stillen  Nebel- \r\nmorgen. Die  obern  Wolken  streifig  und  wollig,  die  untern \r\nschwer.  Mir  schienen  das  gute  Anzeichen.  Ich  hoffte \r\nnach  einem  so  schlimmen  Sommer  einen  guten  Herbst \r\nzu  genießen.  Um  zwölf  in  Eger,  bei  heißem  Sonnen- \r\nschein; und  nun  erinnerte  ich  mich,  daß  dieser  Ort  die- \r\nselbe Polhöhe  habe  wie  meine  Vaterstadt,  und  ich  freute \r\nmich,  wieder  einmal  bei  klarem  Himmel  unter  dem  fünf- \r\nzigsten Grade  zu  Mittag  zu  essen. \r\n\r\nIn  Bayern  stößt  einem  sogleich  das  Stift  Waldsassen  ent- \r\ngegen— köstliche  Besitztümer  der  geistlichen  Herrn,  die \r\nfrüher  als  andere  Menschen  klug  waren.  Es  liegt  in  einer \r\nTeller-,  um  nicht  zu  sagen  Kesseltiefe,  in  einem  schönen \r\nWiesengrunde,  rings  von  fruchtbaren  sanften  Anhöhen \r\numgeben.  Auch  hat  dieses  Kloster  im  Lande  weit  umher \r\nBesitzungen.  Der  Boden  ist  aufgelöster  Tonschiefer.  Der \r\nQuarz,  der  sich  in  dieser  Gebirgsart  befindet  und  sich \r\nnicht  auflöst  noch  verwittert,  macht  das  Feld  locker  und \r\ndiurchaus  fruchtbar.  Bis  gegen  Tirschenreuth  steigt  das \r\nLand  noch.  Die  Wasser  fließen  einem  entgegen,  nach \r\nder  Eger  und  Elbe  zu.  Von  Tirschenreuth  an  fällt  es  nun \r\nsüdwärts  ab,  und  die  Wasser  laufen  nach  der  Donau. \r\nMir  gibt  es  sehr  schnell  einen  Begriff  von  jeder  Gegend, \r\nwenn  ich  bei  dem  kleinsten  Wasser  forsche,  wohin  es \r\nläuft,  zu  welcher  Flußregion  es  gehört.  Man  findet  als- \r\ndann, selbst  in  Gegenden,  die  man  nicht  übersehen  kann, \r\neinen  Zusammenhang  der  Berge  und  Täler  gedanken- \r\nweise. Vor  gedachtem  Ort  beginnt  die  treffliche  Chaussee \r\nvon  Granitsand;  es  läßt  sich  keine  vollkommenere  denken: \r\n\r\n\r\n1 2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ndenn  da  der  aufgelöste  Granit  aus  Kiesel-  und  Tone \r\nbesteht,  so  gibt  das  zugleich  einen  festen  Grund  und \r\nschönes  Bindungsmittel,  die  Straße  glatt  wie  eine  Ten \r\nzu  machen.  Die  Gegend,  durch  die  sie  geführt  ist,  sie \r\ndesto  schlechter  aus:  gleichfalls  Granitsand,  flachliegend, \r\nmoorig,  und  der  schöne  Weg  desto  erwünschter.  Dr \r\nnun  zugleich  das  Land  abfällt,  so  kömmt  man  fort  mi \r\nunglaublicher  Schnelle,  die  gegen  den  böhmischen \r\nSchneckengang  recht  absticht.  Beiliegendes  Blättchen \r\nbenennt  die  verschiedenen  Stationen.  Genug,  ich  war \r\nden  andern  Morgen  um  zehn  Uhr  in  Regensburg  und  hatte \r\nalso  diese  vierundzwanzig  und  eine  halbe  Meile  in  ein- \r\nunddreißig Stunden  zurückgelegt.  Da  es  anfing,  Tag  zu \r\nwerden,  befand  ich  mich  zwischen  Schwandorf  und \r\nRegenstauf,  und  nun  bemerkte  ich  die  Veränderung  des \r\n•^^.ckerbodens  ins  Bessere.  Es  war  nicht  mehr  Verwitterung \r\ndes  Gebirgs,  sondern  aufgeschwemmtes  gemischtes  Erd- \r\nreich. Den  Regenfluß  herauf  hatte  in  uralten  Zeiten  Ebbe \r\nund  Flut  aus  dem  Donautal  in  alle  die  Täler  gewirkt,  die \r\ngegenwärtig  ihre  Wasser  dorthin  ergießen,  und  so  sind \r\ndiese  natürlichen  Polder  entstanden,  worauf  der  Acker- \r\nbau gegründet  ist.  Diese  Bemerkung  gilt  in  der  Nachbar- \r\nschaft aller  größern  und  kleinern  Flüsse,  und  mit  diesem \r\nLeitfaden  kann  der  Beobachter  einen  schnellen  Aufschluß \r\nüber  jeden  der  Kultur  geeigneten  Boden  erlangen. \r\nRegensburg  liegt  gar  schön.  Die  Gegend  mußte  eine \r\nStadt  herlocken;  auch  haben  sich  die  geistlichen  Herrn \r\nwohl  bedacht.  Alles  Feld  um  die  Stadt  gehört  ihnen,  in \r\nder  Stadt  steht  Kirche  gegen  Kirche  und  Stift  gegen \r\nStift.  Die  Donau  erinnert  mich  an  den  alten  Main.  Bei \r\nFrankfurt  haben  Fluß  und  Brücke  ein  besseres  Ansehn, \r\nhier  aber  nimmt  sich  das  gegenüberliegende  Stadt-am- \r\nHof  recht  artig  aus.  Ich  verfügte  mich  gleich  in  das  Jesu- \r\nitenkollegium, wo  das  jälirliche  Schauspiel  durch  Schüler \r\ngegeben  ward,  sah  das  Ende  der  Oper  und  den  Anfang \r\ndes  Trauerspiels.  Sie  machten  es  nicht  schlimmer  als \r\neine  angehende  Liebhabertruppe  und  waren  recht  schön, \r\nfast  zu  prächtig  gekleidet.  Auch  diese  öffentliche  Dar- \r\nstellung hat  mich  von  der  Klugheit  der  Jesuiten  aufs  neue \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      13 \r\n\r\nüberzeugt.  Sie  verschmähten  nichts,  was  irgend  wirken \r\nkonnte,  und  wußten  es  mit  Liebe  und  Aufmerksamkeit  zu \r\nbehandeln.  Hier  ist  nicht  Klugheit,  wie  man  sie  sich  in \r\nAbstracto  denkt,  es  ist  eine  Freude  an  der  Sache  dabei, \r\nein  Mit-  und  Selbstgenuß,  wie  er  aus  dem  Gebrauche \r\ndes  Lebens  entspringt.  Wie  diese  große  geistliche  Ge- \r\nsellschaft Orgelbauer,  Bildschnitzer  und  Vergulder  unter \r\nsich  hat,  so  sind  gewiß  auch  einige,  die  sich  des  Theaters \r\nmit  Kenntnis  und  Neigung  annehmen,  und  wie  durch  ge- \r\nfälligen Prunk  sich  ihre  Kirchen  auszeichnen,  so  bemäch- \r\ntigen sich  die  einsichtigen  Männer  hier  der  weltlichen \r\nSinnlichkeit  durch  ein  anständiges  Theater. \r\nHeute  schreibe  ich  unter  dem  neunundvierzigsten  Grade. \r\nEr  läßt  sich  gut  an.  Der  Morgen  war  kühl,  und  man \r\nklagt  auch  hier  über  Nässe  und  Kälte  des  Sommers;  aber \r\nes  entwickelte  sich  ein  herrlicher  gelinder  Tag.  Die  milde \r\nLuft,  die  ein  großer  Fluß  mitbringt,  ist  ganz  was  Eigenes. \r\nDas  Obst  ist  nicht  sonderlich.  Gute  Birnen  hab'  ich  ge- \r\nspeist; aber  ich  sehne  mich  nach  Trauben  und  Feigen. \r\nDer  Jesuiten  Tun  und  Wesen  hält  meine  Betrachtungen \r\nfest.  Kirchen,  Türme,  Gebäude  haben  etwas  Großes  und \r\nVollständiges  in  der  Anlage,  das  allen  Menschen  insge- \r\nheim Ehrfurcht  einflößt.  Als  Dekoration  ist  nun  Gold, \r\nSilber,  Metall,  geschliffene  Steine  in  solcher  Pracht  und \r\nReichtum  gehäuft,  der  die  Bettler  aller  Stände  blenden \r\nmuß.  Hier  und  da  fehlt  es  auch  nicht  an  etwas  Abge- \r\nschmacktem, damit  die  Menschheit  versöhnt  und  ange- \r\nzogen werde.  Es  ist  dieses  überhaupt  der  Genius  des \r\nkatholischen  äußeren  Gottesdienstes;  noch  nie  habe  ich \r\nes  aber  mit  so  viel  Verstand,  Geschick  und  Konsequenz \r\nausgeführt  gesehen  als  bei  den  Jesuiten.  Alles  trifft  darin \r\nüberein,  daß  sie  nicht  wie  andere  Ordensgeistliche  eine \r\nalte  abgestumpfte  Andacht  fortsetzten,  sondern  sie,  dem \r\nGeist  der  Zeit  zuliebe,  durch  Prunk  und  Pracht  wieder \r\naufstutzten. \r\n\r\nEin  sonderbar  Gestein  wird  hier  zu  Werkstücken  ver- \r\narbeitet, dem  Scheine  nach  eine  Art  Totliegendes,  das \r\njedoch  für  älter,  für  ursprünglich,  ja  für  porphyrartig  ge- \r\nhalten werden  muß.  Es  ist  grünlich,  mit  Quarz  gemischt, \r\n\r\n\r\n1 4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nlöcherig,  und  es  finden  sich  große  Flecke  des  festesten \r\nJaspis  darin,  in  welchen  sich  wieder  kleine  runde  Flecken \r\nvon  Breccienart  zeigen.  Ein  Stück  war  gar  zu  instruktiv \r\nund  appetitlich,  der  Stein  aber  zu  fest,  und  ich  habe \r\ngeschworen,  mich  auf  dieser  Reise  nicht  mit  Steinen  zu \r\nschleppen. \r\n\r\nMi'mchen,  den  6.  September. \r\nDen  fünften  September  halb  ein  Uhr  Mittag  reiste  ich \r\nvon  Regensburg  ab.  Bei  Abach  ist  eine  schöne  Gegend, \r\nwo  die  Donau  sich  an  Kalkfelsen  bricht,  bis  gegen  Saal. \r\nEs  ist  der  Kalk  wie  der  bei  Osteroda  am  Harz,  dicht, \r\naber  im  ganzen  löcherig.  Um  sechs  Uhr  morgens  war \r\nich  in  München,  und  nachdem  ich  mich  zwölf  Stunden \r\numgesehen ,  will  ich  nur  weniges  bemerken.  In  der \r\nBildergalerie  fand  ich  mich  nicht  einheimisch;  ich  muß \r\nmeine  Augen  erst  wieder  an  Gemälde  gewöhnen.  Es  sind \r\ntreffliche  Sachen.  Die  Skizzen  von  Rubens,  von  der \r\nLuxemburger  Galerie,  haben  mir  große  Freude  gemacht. \r\nHier  steht  auch  das  vornehme  Spielwerk,  die  Trajanische \r\nSäule  in  Modell.  Der  Grund  Lapis  Lazuli,  die  Figuren \r\nverguldet.  Es  ist  immer  ein  schön  Stück  Arbeit,  und \r\nman  betrachtet  es  gern. \r\n\r\nIm  Antikensaale  konnte  ich  recht  bemerken,  daß  meine \r\nAugen  auf  diese  Gegenstände  nicht  geübt  sind;  deswegen \r\nwollte  ich  nicht  verweilen  und  Zeit  verderben.  Vieles \r\nsprach  mich  gar  nicht  an,  ohne  daß  ich  sagen  könnte, \r\nwarum.  Ein  Drusus  erregte  meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  zwei \r\nAntonine  gefielen  mir,  imd  so  noch  einiges.  Im  ganzen \r\nstehen  die  Sachen  auch  nicht  glücklich,  ob  man  gleich \r\nmit  ihnen  hat  aufputzen  wollen  und  der  Saal  oder  viel- \r\nmehr das  Gewölbe  ein  gutes  Ansehn  hätte,  wenn  es  nur \r\nreinlicher  und  besser  unterhalten  wäre.  Im  Naturalien- \r\nkabinett fand  ich  schöne  Sachen  aus  Tirol,  die  ich  in \r\nkleinen  Musterstücken  schon  kenne,  ja  besitze. \r\nEs  begegnete  mir  eine  Frau  mit  Feigen,  welche  als  die \r\nersten  vortreftlich  schmeckten.  Aber  das  Obst  über- \r\nhaupt i.st  doch  für  den  achtundvierzigsten  Grad  nicht  be- \r\nsonders gut.    Man  klagt  hier  durchaus  über  Kälte  und \r\n\r\n\r\nKART -SB  AD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      15 \r\n\r\nNässe.  Ein  Nebel,  der  für  einen  Regen  gelten  konnte, \r\nempfing  mich  heute  früh  vor  München.  Den  ganzen  Tag \r\nblies  der  Wind  sehr  kalt  vom  Tiroler  Gebirg.  Als  ich \r\nvomTiu-m  dahin  sah,  fand  ich  es  bedeckt  und  den  ganzen \r\nHimmel  überzogen.  Nun  scheint  die  Sonne  im  Unter- \r\ngehen noch  an  den  alten  Turm,  der  mir  vor  dem  Fenster \r\nsteht.  Verzeihung,  daß  ich  so  sehr  auf  Wind  und  Wetter \r\nacht  habe:  der  Reisende  zu  Lande,  fast  so  sehr  als  der \r\nSchiffer,  hängt  von  beiden  ab,  und  es  wäre  ein  Jammer, \r\nwenn  mein  Herbst  in  fremden  Landen  so  wenig  begünstigt \r\nsein  sollte  als  der  Sommer  zu  Hause. \r\nNun  soll  es  gerade  auf  Innsbruck.  Was  lass'  ich  nicht \r\nalles  rechts  und  links  liegen,  um  den  einen  Gedanken \r\nauszuführen,  der  fast  zu  alt  in  meiner  Seele  geworden  ist! \r\n\r\nMittenzüald.  den  7.  September  abends. \r\nEs  scheint,  mein  Schutzgeist  sagt  Amen  zu  meinemKredo, \r\nund  ich  danke  ihm,  der  mich  an  einem  so  schönen  Tage \r\nhierher  geführt  hat.  Der  letzte  Postillion  sagte  mit  ver- \r\ngnüglichem Ausruf,  es  sei  der  erste  im  ganzen  Sommer. \r\nIch  nähre  meinen  stillen  Aberglauben,  daß  es  so  fort- \r\ngehen soll,  doch  müssen  mir  die  Freunde  verzeihen,  wenn \r\nwieder  von  Luft  und  Wolken  die  Rede  ist. \r\nAls  ich  um  fünf  Uhr  von  München  wegfuhr,  hatte  sich \r\nder  Himmel  aufgeklärt.  An  den  Tiroler  Bergen  standen \r\ndie  Wolken  in  Ungeheuern  Massen  fest.  Die  Streifen  der \r\nuntern  Regionen  bewegten  sich  auch  nicht.  Der  Weg \r\ngeht  auf  den  Höhen,  wo  man  unten  die  Isar  fließen  sieht, \r\nüber  zusammengeschwemmte  Kieshügel  hin.  Hier  wird \r\nuns  die  Arbeit  der  Strömungen  des  uralten  Meeres  faß- \r\nlich. In  manchem  Granitgeschiebe  fand  ich  Geschwister \r\nund  Verwandte  meiner  Kabinettsstücke,  die  ich  Knebeln \r\nverdanke. \r\n\r\nDie  Nebel  des  Flusses  und  der  Wiesen  wehrten  sich  eine \r\nWeile,  endlich  wurden  auch  diese  aufgezehrt.  Zwischen \r\ngedachten  Kieshügeln,  die  man  sich  mehrere  Stunden \r\nweit  und  breit  denken  muß,  das  schönste  fruchtbarste \r\nErdreich,  wie  im  Tale  des  Regenflusses.  Nun  muß  man \r\nwieder  an  die  Isar  und  sieht  einen  Durchschnitt  und  Ab- \r\n\r\n\r\n1 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nhang  der  Kieshügel,  wohl  hundertundfunfzig  Fuß  hoch. \r\nIch  gelangte  nach  Wolfrathshausen  und  erreichte  den \r\nachtundvierzigsten  Grad.  Die  Sonne  brannte  heftig;  nie- \r\nmand traut  dem  schönen  Wetter,  man  schreit  über  das \r\nböse  des  vergehenden  Jahres,  man  jammert,  daß  der  große \r\nGott  gar  keine  Anstalt  machen  will. \r\nNun  ging  mir  eine  neue  Welt  auf.  Ich  näherte  mich  den \r\nGebirgen,  die  sich  nach  und  nach  entwickelten. \r\nBenediktbeuern  liegt  köstlich  und  überrascht  beim  ersten \r\nAnblick.  In  einer  fruchtbaren  Fläche  ein  lang  und  breites \r\nweißes  Gebäude  und  ein  breiter  hoher  Felsrücken  da- \r\nhinter. Nun  geht  es  hinauf  zum  Kochelsee;  noch  höher \r\nins  Gebirge  zum  Walchensee.  Hier  begrüßte  ich  die \r\nersten  beschneiten  Gipfel,  und  auf  meine  Verwunderung, \r\nschon  so  nahe  bei  den  Schneebergen  zu  sein,  vernahm \r\nich,  daß  es  gestern  in  dieser  Gegend  gedonnert,  geblitzt \r\nund  auf  den  Bergen  geschneit  habe.  Aus  diesen  Mete- \r\noren wollte  man  Hoffnung  zu  besserem  Wetter  schöpfen \r\nund  aus  dem  ersten  Schnee  eine  Umwandlung  der  Atmo- \r\nsphäre vermuten.  Die  Felsklippen,  die  mich  umgeben, \r\nsind  alle  Kalk,  von  dem  ältesten,  der  noch  keine  Ver- \r\nsteinerungen enthält.  Diese  Kalkgebirge  gehen  in  Unge- \r\nheuern ununterbrochenen  Reihen  von  Dalmatien  bis  an \r\nden  St.  Gotthard  und  weiter  fort.  Hacquet  hat  einen \r\ngroßen  Teil  der  Kette  bereist.  Sie  lehnen  sich  an  das \r\nquarz-  und  tonreiche  Urgebirge. \r\n\r\nNach  Walchensee  gelangte  ich  um  halb  fünf.  Etwa  eine \r\nStunde  von  dem  Orte  begegnete  mir  ein  artiges  Aben- \r\nteuer: ein  Harfner  mit  seiner  Tochter,  einem  Mädchen \r\nvon  eilf  Jahren,  gingen  vor  mir  her  und  baten  mich,  das \r\nKind  einzunehmen.  Er  trug  das  Instrument  weiter;  ich \r\nließ  sie  zu  mir  sitzen,  und  sie  stellte  mir  eine  große  neue \r\nSchachtel  sorgfältig  zu  ihren  Füßen.  Ein  artiges  ausge- \r\nbildetes Geschöpf,  in  der  Welt  schon  ziemlich  bewandert. \r\nNach  Maria  Einsiedeln  war  sie  mit  ihrer  Mutter  zu  Fuß \r\ngewallfahrtet,  und  beide  wollten  eben  die  größere  Reise \r\nnach  St.  Jago  von  Compostell  antreten,  als  die  Mutter \r\nmit  Tode  abging  und  ihr  Gelübde  nicht  erfüllen  sollte. \r\nMan  könne  in  der  Verehrung  der  Mutter  Gottes  nie  zu \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      17 \r\n\r\nviel  tun,  meinte  sie.    Nach  einem  großen  Brande  habe \r\nsie  selbst  gesehen  ein  ganzes  Haus  niedergebrannt  bis  auf \r\ndie  untersten  Mauern,  und  über  der  Türe,  hinter  einem \r\nGlase,  das  Muttergottesbild,  Glas  und  Bild  unversehrt, \r\nwelches   denn  doch   ein   augenscheinliches  Wunder  sei. \r\nAll   ihre  Reisen  habe  sie  zu  Fuße  gemacht,    zuletzt   in \r\nMünchen  vor  dem  Kurfürsten  gespielt  und  sich  überhaupt \r\nvor  einundzwanzig  fürsthchen  Personen  hören  lassen.   Sie \r\nunterhielt  mich  recht  gut.  Hübsche  große  braune  Augen, \r\neine  eigensinnige  Stirn,    die  sich  manchmal  ein  wenig \r\nhinaufwärts  faltete.    Wenn  sie  sprach,  war  sie  angenehm \r\nund  natürlich,  besonders  wenn  sie  kindisch  laut  lachte; \r\nhingegen  wenn  sie  schwieg,  schien  sie  etwas  bedeuten  zu \r\nwollen  und  machte  mit  der  Oberlippe  eine  fatale  Miene. \r\nIch   sprach  sehr  viel  mit  ihr  durch,  sie  war  überall  zu \r\nHause  und  merkte  gut  auf  die  Gegenstände.    So  fragte \r\nsie  mich  einmal,  was  das  für  ein  Baum  sei?  Es  war  ein \r\nschöner  großer  Ahorn,  der  erste,  der  mir  auf  der  ganzen \r\nReise  zu  Gesichte  kam.    Den  hatte  sie  doch  gleich  be- \r\nmerkt und  freute  sich,  da  mehrere  nach  und  nach  er- \r\nschienen, daß  sie  auch  diesen  Baum  unterscheiden  könne. \r\nSie  gehe,  sagte  sie,  nach  Bozen  auf  die  Messe,  wo  ich \r\ndoch  wahrscheinlich  auch  hinzöge.    Wenn  sie  mich  dort \r\nanträfe,  müsse  ich  ihr  einen  Jahrmarkt  kaufen,  welches \r\nich  ihr  denn  auch  versprach.    Dort  wolle  sie  auch  ihre \r\nneue  Haube  aufsetzen,  die  sie  sich  in  München  von  ihrem \r\nVerdienst  habe  machen  lassen.    Sie  wolle  mir  solche  im \r\nvoraus  zeigen.    Nun  eröffnete  sie  die  Schachtel,  und  ich \r\nmußte   mich   des   reichgestickten   und  wohlbebänderten \r\nKopfschmuckes  mit  ihr  erfreuen. \r\n\r\nÜber  eine  andere  frohe  Aussicht  vergnügten  wir  uns  gleich- \r\nfalls zusammen.  Sie  versicherte  nämlich,  daß  es  gut  Wetter \r\ngäbe.  Sie  trügen  ihren  Barometer  mit  sich,  und  das  sei \r\ndie  Harfe.  Wenn  sich  der  Diskant  hinaufstimme,  so  gebe \r\nes  gutes  Wetter,  und  das  habe  er  heute  getan.  Ich  ergriff \r\ndas  Omen,  und  wir  schieden  im  besten  Humor  in  der \r\nHoffnung  eines  baldigen  Wiedersehns. \r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  2 \r\n\r\n\r\nt8  italienische  REISE  I \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Brenner^  den  8.  September  abends. \r\n\r\nHier  gekommen,  gleichsam  gezwungen,  endlich  an  einen \r\nRuhepunkt,  an  einen  stillen  Ort,  wie  ich  ihn  mir  nur  hätte \r\nwünschen  können.  Es  war  ein  Tag,  den  man  jahrelang \r\nin  der  Erinnerung  genießen  kann.  Um  sechs  Uhr  verließ \r\nich  Mittenwald,  den  klaren  Himmel  reinigte  ein  scharfer \r\n\\Vind  vollkommen.  Es  war  eine  Kälte,  wie  sie  nur  im \r\nFebruar  erlaubt  ist.  Nun  aber,  bei  dem  Glänze  der  auf- \r\ngehenden Sonne,  die  dunkeln,  mit  Fichten  bewachsenen \r\nVordergründe,  die  grauen  Kalkfelsen  dazwischen  und  da- \r\nhinter die  beschneiten  höchsten  Gipfel  auf  einem  tieferen \r\nHimmelsblau,  das  waren  köstliche,  ewig  abwechselnde \r\nBilder. \r\n\r\nRei  Scharnitz  kommt  man  ins  Tirol.  Die  Grenze  ist  mit \r\neinem  Walle  geschlossen,  der  das  Tal  verriegelt  und  sich \r\nan  die  Berge  anschließt.  Es  sieht  gut  aus:  an  der  einen \r\nSeite  ist  der  Felsen  befestigt,  an  der  andern  steigt  er \r\nsenkrecht  in  die  Höhe.  Von  Seefeld  wird  der  Weg  immer \r\ninteressanter,  und  wenn  er  bisher,  seit  Benediktbeuern \r\nherauf,  von  Höhe  zu  Höhe  stieg  und  alle  Wasser  die \r\nRegion  der  Isar  suchten,  so  blickt  man  nun  über  einen \r\nRücken  in  das  Inntal,  und  Inzingen  liegt  vor  uns.  Die \r\nSonne  war  hoch  und  heiß,  ich  mußte  meine  Kleidung  er- \r\nleichtern, die  ich  bei  der  veränderlichen  Atmosphäre  des \r\nTages  oft  wechsele. \r\n\r\nBei  Zirl  fährt  man  ins  Inntal  herab.  Die  Lage  ist  un- \r\nbeschreiblich schön,  und  der  hohe  Sonnenduft  machte  sie \r\nganz  herrlich.  Der  Postillion  eilte  mehr,  als  ich  wünschte: \r\ner  hatte  noch  keine  Messe  gehört  und  wollte  sie  in  Inns- \r\nbruck— es  war  eben  Marientag — um  desto  andächtiger  zu \r\nsich  nehmen.  Nun  rasselte  es  immer  an  dem  Inn  hinab, \r\nan  der  Martinswand  vorbei,  einer  steil  abgehenden  Un- \r\ngeheuern Kalkwand.  Zu  dem  Platze,  wohin  Kaiser  Maxi- \r\nmilian sich  verstiegen  haben  soll,  getraute  ich  mir  wohl \r\nohne  Engel  hin  und  her  zu  kommen,  ob  es  gleich  immer \r\nein  frevelhaftes  Unternehmen  wäre. \r\nInnsbruck  liegt  herrlich  in  einem  breiten  reichen  Tale, \r\nzwischen  hohen  Felsen  und  Gebirgen.     F>st  wollte  ich \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      19 \r\n\r\ndableiben,  aber  es  ließ  mir  keine  Ruhe.  Kurze  Zeit  er- \r\ngötzte ich  mich  an  dem  Sohne  des  Wirts,  einem  leib- \r\nhaftigen Söller.  So  begegnen  mir  nach  und  nach  meine \r\nMenschen.  Das  Fest  Maria  Geburt  zu  feiern,  ist  alles \r\ngeputzt.  Gesund  und  wohlhäbig,  zu  Scharen,  wallfahrten \r\nsie  nach  Wüten,  einem  Andachtsorte,  eine  Viertel- \r\nstunde von  der  Stadt  gegen  das  Gebirge  zu.  Um  zwei \r\nUhr,  als  mein  rollender  Wagen  das  muntere  bunte  Ge- \r\ndränge teilte,  war  alles  in  frohem  Zug  und  Gang. \r\nVon  Innsbruck  herauf  wird  es  immer  schöner,  da  hilft \r\nkein  Beschreiben.  Auf  den  gebahntesten  Wegen  steigt \r\nman  eine  Schlucht  herauf,  die  das  Wasser  nach  dem  Inn \r\nzu  sendet,  eine  Schlucht,  die  den  Augen  unzählige  Ab- \r\nwechselungen bietet.  Wenn  der  Weg  nah  am  schroffsten \r\nFelsen  hergeht,  ja  in  ihn  hineingehauen  ist,  so  erblickt \r\nman  die  Seite  gegenüber  sanft  abhängig,  so  daß  noch  kann \r\nder  schönste  Feldbau  darauf  geübt  werden.  Es  liegen \r\nDörfer,  Häuser,  Häuschen,  Hütten,  alles  weiß  angestrichen, \r\nzwischen  Feldern  und  Hecken  auf  der  abhängenden  hohen \r\nund  breiten  Fläche.  Bald  verengert  sich  das  Ganze:  das \r\nBenutzbare  wird  zur  Wiese,  bis  sich  auch  das  in  einen \r\nsteilen  Abhang  verliert. \r\n\r\nZu  meiner  Welterschaffung  habe  ich  manches  erobert, \r\ndoch  nichts  ganz  Neues  und  Unerwartetes.  Auch  habe  ich \r\nviel  geträumt  von  dem  Modell,  wovon  ich  so  lange  rede, \r\nworan  ich  so  gern  anschaulich  machen  möchte,  was  in \r\nmeinem  Innern  herumzieht  und  was  ich  nicht  jedem  in \r\nder  Natiu:  vor  Augen  stellen  kann. \r\n\r\nNun  wurde  es  dunkler  und  dunkler,  das  einzelne  verlor \r\nsich,  die  Massen  wurden  immer  größer  und  herrlicher; \r\nendlich,  da  sich  alles  nur  wie  ein  tiefes  geheimes  Bild  vor \r\nmir  bewegte,  sah  ich  auf  einmal  wieder  die  hohen  Schnee- \r\ngipfel, vom  Mond  beleuchtet,  und  nun  erwarte  ich,  daß \r\nder  Morgen  diese  Felsenkluft  erhelle,  in  der  ich  auf  der \r\nGrenzscheide  des  Südens  und  Nordens  eingeklemmt  bin. \r\n\r\nIch  füge  noch  einige  Bemerkungen  hinzu  über  die  Witte- \r\nrung, die  mir  vielleicht  eben  deswegen  so  günstig  ist,  weil \r\nich  ihr  so  viele  Betrachtungen  widme.    Auf  dem  flachen \r\n\r\n\r\n2  0  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nLande  empfängt  man  gutes  und  böses  Wetter,  wenn  es \r\nschon  fertig  geworden,  im  Gebirge  ist  man  gegenwärtig, \r\nwenn  es  entsteht.  Dieses  ist  mir  nun  so  oft  begegnet, \r\nwenn  ich  auf  Reisen,  Spaziergängen,  auf  der  Jagd,  Tag' \r\nund  Nächte  lang  in  den  Bergwäldern,  zwischen  Klippen \r\nverweilte,  und  da  ist  mir  eine  Grille  aufgestiegen,  die  ich \r\nauch  für  nichts  anders  geben  will,  die  ich  aber  nicht  los- \r\nwerden kann,  wie  man  denn  eben  die  Grillen  am  wenigsten \r\nlos  wird.  Ich  sehe  sie  überall,  als  wenn  es  eine  Wahrheit \r\nwäre;  und  so  will  ich  sie  denn  auch  aussprechen,  da  ich \r\nohnehin  die  Nachsicht  meiner  Freunde  so  oft  zu  prüfen \r\nim  Falle  bin. \r\n\r\nBetrachten  wir  die  Gebirge  näher  oder  ferner  und  sehen \r\nihre  Gipfel  bald  im  Sonnenscheine  glänzen,  bald  vom \r\nNebel  umzogen,  von  stürmenden  Wolken  umsaust,  von \r\nRegenstrichen  gepeitscht,  mit  Schnee  bedeckt,  so  schreiben \r\nwir  das  alles  der  Atmosphäre  zu,  da  wir  mit  Augen  ihre \r\nBewegungen  und  Veränderungen  gar  wohl  sehen  und  fassen. \r\nDie  Gebirge  hingegen  liegen  vor  unserm  äußeren  Sinn  in \r\nihrer  herkömmlichen  Gestalt  unbeweglich  da.  Wir  halten \r\nsie  für  tot,  weil  sie  erstarrt  sind;  wir  glauben  sie  untätig, \r\nweil  sie  ruhen.  Ich  aber  kann  mich  schon  seit  längerer \r\nZeit  nicht  entbrechen,  einer  innern,  stillen,  geheimen \r\nWirkung  derselben  die  Veränderungen,  die  sich  in  der \r\nAtmosphäre  zeigen,  zum  großen  Teile  zuzuschreiben.  Ich \r\nglaube  nämlich,  daß  die  Masse  der  Erde  überhaupt,  und \r\nfolglich  auch  besonders  ihre  hervorragenden  Grundfesten, \r\nnicht  eine  beständige,  immer  gleiche  Anziehungskraft  aus- \r\nüben, sondern  daß  diese  Anziehungskraft  sich  in  einem \r\ngewissen  Pulsieren  äußert,  so  daß  sie  sich  durch  innere \r\nnotwendige,  vielleicht  auch  äußere  zufällige  Ursachen  bald \r\nvermehrt,  bald  vermindert.  Mögen  alle  anderen  Ver- \r\nsuche, diese  Oszillation  darzustellen,  zu  beschränkt  und \r\nroh  sein,  die  Atmosphäre  ist  zart  und  weit  genug,  um \r\nuns  von  jenen  stillen  Wirkungen  zu  unterrichten.  Ver- \r\nmindert sich  jene  Anziehungskraft  im  geringsten,  alsobald \r\ndeutet  uns  die  verringerte  Schwere,  die  verminderte \r\nElastizität  der  Luft  diese  Wirkung  an.  Die  Atmosphäre \r\nkann  die  Feuchtigkeit,  die  in  ihr  chemisch  und  mechanisch \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      21 \r\n\r\nverteilt  war,  nicht  mehr  tragen:  Wolken  senken  sich,  Regen \r\nstürzen  nieder,  und  Regenströme  ziehen  nach  dem  Lande \r\nzu.  Vermehrt  aber  das  Gebirg  seine  Schwerkraft,  so  wird \r\nalsobald  die  Elastizität  der  Luft  wieder  hergestellt,  und \r\nes  entspringen  zwei  wichtige  Phänomene.  Einmal  ver- \r\nsammeln die  Berge  ungeheuere  Wolkenmassen  um  sich \r\nher,  halten  sie  fest  und  starr,  wie  zweite  Gipfel  über  sich, \r\nbis  sie,  durch  Innern  Kampf  elektrischer  Kräfte  bestimmt, \r\nals  Gewitter,  Nebel  und  Regen  niedergehen;  sodann  wirkt \r\nauf  den  Überrest  die  elastische  Luft,  welche  nun  wieder \r\nmehr  Wasser  zu  fassen,  aufzulösen  und  zu  verarbeiten \r\nfähig  ist.  Ich  sah  das  Aufzehren  einer  solchen  Wolke  ganz \r\ndeutlich:  sie  hing  um  den  steilsten  Gipfel,  das  Abendrot \r\nbeschien  sie.  Langsam,  langsam  sonderten  ihre  Enden \r\nsich  ab,  einige  Flocken  wurden  weggezogen  und  in  die \r\nHöhe  gehoben;  diese  verschwanden,  und  so  verschwand \r\ndie  ganze  Masse  nach  und  nach  und  ward  vor  meinen \r\nAugen  wie  ein  Rocken  von  einer  unsichtbaren  Hand  ganz \r\neigentlich  abgesponnen. \r\n\r\nWenn  die  Freunde  über  den  ambulanten  Wetterbeobachter \r\nund  dessen  seltsame  Theorien  gelächelt  haben,  so  gebe \r\nich  ihnen  vielleicht  durch  einige  andere  Betrachtungen \r\nGelegenheit  zum  Lachen;  denn  ich  muß  gestehen,  da \r\nmeine  Reise  eigentlich  eine  Flucht  war,  vor  allen  den \r\nUnbilden,  die  ich  unter  dem  einundfunfzigsten  Grade  er- \r\nhtten,  daß  ich  Hoffnung  hatte,  unter  dem  achtundvier- \r\nzigsten ein  wahres  Gosen  zu  betreten.  Allein  ich  fand \r\nmich  getäuscht,  wie  ich  früher  hätte  wissen  sollen:  denn \r\nnicht  die  Polhöhe  allein  macht  Klima  und  Witterung, \r\nsondern  die  Bergreihen,  besonders  jene,  die  von  Morgen \r\nnach  Abend  die  Länder  durchschneiden.  In  diesen  er- \r\neignen sich  immer  große  Veränderungen,  und  nordwärts \r\nliegende  Länder  haben  am  meisten  darunter  zu  leiden. \r\nSo  scheint  auch  die  Witterung  für  den  ganzen  Norden  die- \r\nsen Sommer  über  durch  die  große  Alpenkette,  auf  der  ich \r\ndieses  schreibe,  bestimmt  worden  zu  sein.  Hier  hat  es  die \r\nletzten  Monate  her  immer  geregnet,  und  Südwest  und  Süd- \r\nost haben  den  Regen  durchaus  nordwärts  geführt.  In  Ita- \r\nlien sollen  sie  schön  Wetter,  ja  zu  trocken  gehabt  haben. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nNun  von  dem  abhängigen,  durch  Klima,  Berghöhe,  Feuch- \r\ntigkeit auf  das  mannigfaltigste  bedingten  Pflanzenreich \r\neinige  Worte.  Auch  hierin  habe  ich  keine  sonderliche \r\nVeränderung,  doch  Gewinn  gefunden.  Äpfel  und  Birnen \r\nhängen  schon  häufig  vor  Innsbruck  in  dem  Tale,  Ffirschen \r\nund  Trauben  hingegen  bringen  sie  aus  Welschland  oder \r\nvielmehr  aus  dem  mittägigen  Tirol.  Um  Innsbruck  bauen \r\nsie  viel  Türkisch-  und  Heidekorn,  das  sie  Blende  nennen. \r\nDen  Brenner  herauf  sah  ich  die  ersten  Lärchenbäume, \r\nbei  Schönberg  den  ersten  Zirbel.  Ob  wohl  das  Harfner- \r\nmädchen hier  auch  nachgefragt  hätte? \r\nDie  Pflanzen  betreffend,  fühl'  ich  noch  sehr  meine  Schüler- \r\nschaft. Bis  München  glaubt  ich  wirklich  nur  die  gewöhn- \r\nlichen zu  sehen.  Freilich  war  meine  eilige  Tag-  und \r\nNachtfahrt  solchen  feinern  Beobachtungen  nicht  günstig. \r\nNun  habe  ich  zwar  meinen  Linntf  bei  mir,  und  seine \r\nTerminologie  wohl  eingeprägt;  wo  soll  aber  Zeit  und  Ruhe \r\nzum  Analysieren  herkommen,  das  ohnehin,  wenn  ich  mich \r\nrecht  kenne,  meine  Stärke  niemals  werden  kann?  Daher \r\nschärf  ich  mein  Auge  aufs  Allgemeine,  und  als  ich  am \r\nWalchensee  die  erste  Gentiana  sah,  fiel  mir  auf,  daß  ich \r\nauch  bisher  zuerst  am  Wasser  die  neuen  Pflanzen  fand. \r\nWas  mich  noch  aufmerksamer  machte,  war  der  Einfluß, \r\nden  die  Gebirgshöhe  auf  die  Pflanzen  zu  haben  schien. \r\nNicht  nur  neue  Pflanzen  fand  ich  da,  sondern  Wachs- \r\ntum der  alten  verändert;  wenn  in  der  tiefern  Gegend \r\nZweige  und  Stengel  stärker  und  mastiger  waren,  die  Augen \r\nnäher  aneinander  standen  und  die  Blätter  breit  waren, \r\nso  wurden  höher  ins  Gebirg  hinauf  Zweige  und  Stengel \r\nzarter,  die  Augen  rückten  auseinander,  so  daß  von  Knoten \r\nzu  Knoten  ein  größerer  Zwischenraum  stattfand  und  die \r\nBlätter  sich  lanzenförmiger  bildeten.  Ich  bemerkte  dies \r\nbei  einer  Weide  und  einer  Gentiana  und  überzeugte  mich, \r\ndaß  es  nicht  etwa  verschiedene  Arten  wären.  Auch  am \r\nWalchensee  bemerkte  ich  längere  und  schlankere  Binsen \r\nals  im  Unterlande. \r\n\r\nDie  Kalkalpen,  welche  ich  bisher  durchschnitten,  haben \r\neine  graue  Farbe  und  schöne,  sonderbare,  unregelmäßige \r\nFormen,  ob  sich  gleich  der  Fels  in  Lager  und  Bänke  teilt. \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      23 \r\n\r\nAber  weil  auch  geschwungene  Lager  vorkommen  und  der \r\nFels  überhaupt  ungleich  verwittert,  so  sehen  die  Wände \r\nund  Gipfel  seltsam  aus.  Diese  Gebirgsart  steigt  den \r\nBrenner  weit  herauf.  In  der  Gegend  des  oberen  Sees  fand \r\nich  eine  Veränderung  desselben.  An  dunkelgrünen  und \r\ndunkelgrauen  Glimmerschiefer,  stark  mit  Quarz  durch- \r\nzogen, lehnte  sich  ein  weißer  dichter  Kalkstein,  der  an \r\nder  Ablösung  glimmerig  war  und  in  großen,  obgleich  un- \r\nendlich zerklüfteten  Massen  anstand.  Über  demselben \r\nfand  ich  wieder  Glimmerschiefer,  der  mir  aber  zarter  als \r\nder  vorige  zu  sein  schien.  Weiter  hinauf  zeigt  sich  eine \r\nbesondere  Art  Gneis  oder  vielmehr  eine  Granitart,  die \r\nsich  dem  Gneis  zubildet,  wie  in  der  Gegend  von  Elbogen. \r\nHier  oben,  gegen  dem  Hause  über,  ist  der  Fels  Glimmer- \r\nschiefer. Die  Wasser,  die  aus  dem  Berge  kommen, \r\nbringen  nur  diesen  Stein  und  grauen  Kalk  mit. \r\nNicht  fern  muß  der  Granitstock  sein,  an  den  sich  alles \r\nanlehnt.  Die  Karte  zeigt,  daß  man  sich  an  der  Seite  des \r\neigentlichen  großen  Brenners  befindet,  von  dem  aus  die \r\nWasser  sich  ringsum  ergießen. \r\n\r\nVom  Äußern  des  Menschengeschlechts  habe  ich  so  viel \r\naufgefaßt.  Die  Nation  ist  wacker  und  gerade  vor  sich \r\nhin.  Die  Gestalten  bleiben  sich  ziemlich  gleich:  braune \r\nwohlgeöffnete  Augen  und  sehr  gut  gezeichnete  schwarze \r\nAugenbraunen  bei  den  Weibern;  dagegen  blonde  und \r\nbreite  Augenbraunen  bei  den  Männern.  Diesen  geben \r\ndie  grünen  Hüte  zwischen  den  grauen  Felsen  ein  fröh- \r\nliches Ansehn.  Sie  tragen  sie  geziert  mit  Bändern  oder \r\nbreiten  Schärpen  von  Taft  mit  Fransen,  die  mit  Nadeln \r\ngar  zierlich  aufgeheftet  werden.  Auch  hat  jeder  eine \r\nBlume  oder  eine  Feder  auf  dem  Hut.  Dagegen  verbilden \r\nsich  die  Weiber  durch  weiße,  baumwollene,  zottige,  sehr \r\nweite  Mützen,  als  wären  es  unförmliche  Mannesnacht- \r\nmützen. Das  gibt  ihnen  ein  ganz  fremdes  Ansehn,  da  sie \r\nim  Auslande  die  grünen  Mannshüte  tragen,  die  sehr  schön \r\nkleiden. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  Gelegenheit  gehabt,  zu  sehen,  welchen  Wert  die \r\ngemeinen  Leute  auf  Pfauenfedern  legen,  und  wie  über- \r\nhaupt jede  bunte  Feder  geehrt  wird.    Wer  diese  Gebirge \r\n\r\n\r\n2  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nbereisen  wollte,  müßte  dergleichen  mit  sich  führen.  Eine \r\nsolche  am  rechten  Orte  angebrachte  Feder  würde  statt \r\ndes  willkommensten  Trinkgeldes  dienen. \r\nIndem  ich  nun  diese  Blätter  sondere,  sammele,  hefte  und \r\ndergestalt  einrichte,  daß  sie  meinen  Freunden  bald  einen \r\nleichten  Überblick  meiner  bisherigen  Schicksale  gewähren \r\nkönnen,  und  daß  ich  mir  zugleich,  was  ich  bisher  erfahren \r\nund  gedacht,  von  der  Seele  wälze,  betrachte  ich  dagegen \r\nmit  einem  Schauer  manche  Pakete,  von  denen  ich  ein \r\nkurz  und  gutes  Bekenntnis  ablegen  muß:  sind  es  doch \r\nmeine  Begleiter,  werden  sie  nicht  viel  Einfluß  auf  meine \r\nnächsten  Tage  haben! \r\n\r\nIch  hatte  nach  Karlsbad  meine  sämtlichen  Schriften  mit- \r\ngenommen, um  die  von  Göschen  zu  besorgende  Ausgabe \r\nschließlich  zusammenzustellen.  Die  ungedruckten  besaß \r\nich  schon  längst  in  schönen  Abschriften,  von  der  ge- \r\nschickten Hand  des  Sekretär  Vogel.  Dieser  wackere \r\nMann  begleitete  mich  auch  diesmal,  um  mir  durch  seine \r\nFertigkeit  beizustehen.  Dadurch  ward  ich  in  den  Stand \r\ngesetzt,  die  vier  ersten  Bände,  unter  der  treusten  Mit- \r\nwirkung Herders,  an  den  Verleger  abzusenden,  und  war \r\nim  Begrifi\",  mit  den  vier  letzten  das  gleiche  zu  tun.  Diese \r\nbestanden  teils  aus  nur  entworfenen  Arbeiten,  ja  aus \r\nFragmenten,  wie  denn  meine  Unart,  vieles  anzufangen \r\nund  bei  vermindertem  Interesse  liegen  zu  lassen,  mit  den \r\nJahren,  Beschäftigungen  und  Zerstreuungen  allgemach  zu- \r\ngenommen hatte. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  nun  diese  Dinge  sämtlich  mit  mir  führte,  so  ge- \r\nhorchte ich  gern  den  Anforderungen  der  Karlsbader  geist- \r\nreichen Gesellschaft  und  las  ihr  alles  vor,  was  bisher \r\nunbekannt  geblieben,  da  man  sich  denn  jede.smal  über \r\ndasNichtvoUbringen  derjenigen  Dinge,  an  denen  man  sich \r\ngern  länger  unterhalten  hätte,  bitterlich  beschwerte. \r\nDie  Feier  meines  Geburtstages  bestand  hauptsächlich \r\ndarin,  daß  ich  mehrere  Gedichte  erhielt,  im  Namen  mei- \r\nner unternommenen  aber  vernachlässigten  Arbeiten,  worin \r\nsich  jedes  nach  seiner  Art  über  mein  Verfahren  beklagte. \r\nDarunter  zeichnete  sich  ein  Gedicht  im  Namen  der  Vögel \r\naus.  wo  eine  an  Treufreund  gesendete  Deputation  dieser \r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSBAD  BIS  AUF  DEN  BRENNER  1786      25 \r\n\r\nmuntern  Geschöpfe  inständig  bat,  er  möchte  doch  das \r\nihnen  zugesagte  Reich  nunmehr  auch  gründen  und  ein- \r\nrichten. Nicht  weniger  einsichtig  und  anmutig  waren \r\ndie  Äußerungen  über  meine  andern  Stückwerke,  so  daß \r\nsie  mir  auf  einmal  wieder  lebendig  wurden  und  ich  den \r\nFreunden  meine  gehabten  Vorsätze  und  vollständigen  Plane \r\nmit  Vergnügen  erzählte.  Dies  veranlaßte  dringende  For- \r\nderungen und  Wünsche  und  gab  Herdem  gewonnen  Spiel, \r\nals  er  mich  zu  überreden  suchte,  ich  möchte  diese  Papiere \r\nnochmals  mit  mir  nehmen,  vor  allen  aber  Iphigenien \r\nnoch  einige  Aufmeiksamkeit  schenken,  welche  sie  wohl \r\nverdiene.  Das  Stück^  wie  es  gegenwärtig  liegt,  ist  m^ehr \r\nEntwurf  als  Ausführung;  es  ist  in  poetischer  Prosa  ge- \r\nschrieben, die  sich  manchmal  in  einen  jambischen  Rhyth- \r\nmus verliert,  auch  wohl  andern  Silbenmaßen  ähnelt. \r\nDieses  tut  freilich  der  Wirkung  großen  Eintrag,  wenn  man \r\nes  nicht  sehr  gut  liest  und  durch  gewisse  Kunstgriffe  die \r\nMängel  zu  verbergen  weiß.  Er  legte  mir  dieses  so  dringend \r\nans  Herz,  und  da  ich  meinen  größeren  Reiseplan  ihm \r\nwie  allen  verborgen  hatte,  so  glaubte  er,  es  sei  nur  wieder \r\nvon  einer  Bergwanderung  die  Rede,  und  weil  er  sich \r\ngegen  Mineralogie  und  Geologie  immer  spöttisch  erwies, \r\nmeinte  er,  ich  sollte,  anstatt  taubes  Gestein  zu  klopfen, \r\nmeine  Werkzeuge  an  diese  Arbeit  wenden.  Ich  gehorchte \r\nso  vielen  wohlgemeinten  Andrängen;  bis  hierher  aber \r\nwar  es  nicht  möglich,  meine  Aufmerksamkeit  dahin  zu \r\nlenken.  Jetzt  sondere  ich  Iphigenien  aus  dem  Paket  und \r\nnehme  sie  mit  in  das  schöne,  warme  Land  als  Begleiterin. \r\nDer  Tag  ist  so  lang,  das  Nachdenken  ungestört,  und  die \r\nherrlichen  Bilder  der  Umwelt  verdrängen  keineswegs  den \r\npoetischen  Sinn,  sie  rufen  ihn  vielmehr,  von  Bewegung \r\nund  freier  Luft  begleitet,  nur  desto  schneller  hervor. \r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA \r\n\r\nTrient,  den  11.  Septe?nber  iy86  früh. \r\n\r\nNACHDEM  ich  völlig  fünfzig  Stunden  am  Leben  und  in \r\nsteter  Beschäftigung  gewesen,  kam  ich  gestern  abend \r\num  acht  Uhr  hier  an,  begab  mich  bald  zur  Ruhe  und  finde \r\n\r\n\r\n2  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nmich  nun  wieder  imstande,  in  meiner  Erzählung  fortzu- \r\nfahren. Am  neunten,  abends,  als  ich  das  erste  Stück \r\nmeines  Tagebuchs  geschlossen  hatte,  wollte  ich  noch  die \r\nHerberge,  das  Posthaus  auf  dem  Brenner,  in  seiner  Lage \r\nzeichnen;  aber  es  gelang  nicht,  ich  verfehlte  den  Charak- \r\nter und  ging  halb  verdrießlich  nach  Hause.  Der  Wirt \r\nfragte  mich,  ob  ich  nicht  fort  wollte:  es  sei  Mondenschein \r\nund  der  beste  Weg,  und  ob  ich  wohl  wußte,  daß  er  die \r\nPferde  morgen  früh  zum  Einfahren  des  Grummets  brauchte \r\nund  bis  dahin  gern  wieder  zu  Hause  hätte,  sein  Rat  also \r\neigennützig  war,  so  nahm  ich  ihn  doch,  weil  er  mit  meinem \r\ninnern  Triebe  übereinstimmte,  als  gut  an.  Die  Sonne  ließ \r\nsich  wieder  blicken,  die  Luft  war  leidlich;  ich  packte  ein, \r\nund  um  sieben  Uhr  fuhr  ich  weg.  Die  Atmosphäre  ward \r\nüber  die  Wolken  Herr  und  der  Abend  gar  schön. \r\nDer  Postillion  schlief  ein,  und  die  Pferde  liefen  den \r\nschnellsten  Trab  bergunter,  immer  auf  dem  bekannten \r\nWege  fort;  kamen  sie  an  ein  eben  Fleck,  so  ging  es  desto \r\nlangsamer.  Der  Führer  wachte  auf  und  trieb  wieder  an, \r\nund  so  kam  ich  sehr  geschwind,  zwischen  hohen  Felsen, \r\nan  dem  reißenden  Etschtiuß  hinunter.  Der  Mond  ging \r\nauf  und  beleuchtete  ungeheuere  Gegenstände.  Einige \r\nMühlen  zwischen  uralten  Fichten  über  dem  schäumenden \r\nStrom  waren  völlige  Everdingen. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  um  neun  Uhr  nach  Sterzing  gelangte,  gab  man \r\nmir  zu  verstehen,  daß  man  mich  gleich  wieder  weg- \r\nwünsche. In  Mittewald  Punkt  zwölf  Uhr  fand  ich  alles \r\nin  tiefem  Schlafe,  außer  dem  Postillion,  und  so  ging  es \r\nweiter  auf  Brixen,  wo  man  mich  wieder  gleichsam  ent- \r\nführte, so  daß  ich  mit  dem  Tage  in  Collman  ankam.  Die \r\nPostillions  fuhren,  daß  einem  Sehen  und  Hören  verging; \r\nund  so  leid  es  mir  tat,  diese  herrlichen  Gegenden  mit \r\nder  entsetzlichsten  Schnelle  und  bei  Nacht  wie  im  Fluge \r\nzu  durchreisen,  so  freuete  es  mich  doch  innerlich,  daß  ein \r\ngünstiger  Wind  hinter  mir  herblies  und  mich  meinen \r\nWünschen  zujagte.  Mit  Tagesanbruch  erblickte  ich  die \r\nersten  Rebhügel.  Eine  Frau  mit  Birnen  und  Pfirschen \r\nbegegnete  mir;  und  so  ging  es  auf  Teutschen  los,  wo  ich \r\num  sieben  Uhr  ankam  und  gleich  weiter  befördert  wurde. \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  27 \r\n\r\nNun  erblickte  ich  endlich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  nach- \r\ndem ich  wieder  eine  Weile  nordwärts  gefahren  war,  das \r\nTal,  worin  Bozen  liegt.  Von  steilen,  bis  auf  eine  ziem- \r\nliche Höhe  angebauten  Bergen  umgeben,  ist  es  gegen \r\nMittag  ofien,  gegen  Norden  von  den  Tiroler  Bergen  ge- \r\ndeckt. Eine  milde  sanfte  Luft  füllte  die  Gegend.  Hier \r\nwendet  sich  die  Etsch  wieder  gegen  Mittag.  Die  Hügel \r\nam  Fuße  der  Berge  sind  mit  Wein  bebaut.  Über  lange, \r\nniedrige  Lauben  sind  die  Stöcke  gezogen,  die  blauen  Trau- \r\nben hängen  gar  zierlich  von  der  Decke  herunter  und  reifen \r\nan  der  Wärme  des  nahen  Bodens.  Auchin  der  Fläche  desTals, \r\nwo  sonst  nur  Wiesen  sind,  wird  der  Wein  in  solchen  eng  an- \r\neinander stehendenReihenvonLauben  gebaut,  dazwischen \r\ndas  türkische  Korn,  das  nun  immer  höhere  Stengel  treibt. \r\nIch  habe  es  oft  zu  zehn  Fuß  hoch  gesehen.  Die  zaselige \r\nmännliche  Blüte  ist  noch  nicht  abgeschnitten,  wie  es  ge- \r\nschieht, wenn  die  Befruchtung  eine  Zeitlang  vorbei  ist. \r\nBei  heiterm  Sonnenschein  kam  ich  nach  Bozen.  Die  vielen \r\nKaufmannsgesichter  freuten  mich  beisammen.  Ein  ab- \r\nsichtliches, wohlbehagliches  Dasein  drückt  sich  recht \r\nlebhaft  aus.  Auf  dem  Platze  saßen  Obstweiber  mit  runden, \r\nflachen  Körben,  über  vier  Fuß  im  Duixhmesser,  worin \r\ndie  Pfirschen  nebeneinander  lagen,  daß  sie  sich  nicht \r\ndrücken  sollten.  Ebenso  die  Birnen.  Hier  fiel  mir  ein, \r\nwas  ich  in  Regensburg  am  Fenster  des  Wirtshauses  ge- \r\nschrieben sah: \r\n\r\nComme  les  peches  et  les  melons \r\n\r\nSont  poiur  la  bouche  d'un  baron, \r\n\r\nAinsi  les  verges  et  les  bätons \r\n\r\nSont  pour  les  fous,  dit  Salomon. \r\n\r\nDaß  ein  nordischer  Baron  dieses  geschrieben,  ist  offenbar, \r\n\r\nund  daß  er  in  diesen  Gegenden  seine    BegTiffe  ändern \r\n\r\nwürde,  ist  auch  natürlich. \r\n\r\nDie  Bozner  Messe  bewirkt  einen  starken  Seidenvertrieb; \r\nauch  Tücher  werden  dahin  gebracht,  und  was  an  Leder \r\naus  den  gebirgigen  Gegenden  zusammengeschafft  wird. \r\nDoch  kommen  mehrere  Kaufleute  hauptsächlich,  um \r\nGelder  einzukassieren,  Bestellungen  anzunehmen  und \r\nneuen  Kredit  zu  geben,   dahin.    Ich  hatte  große  Lust, \r\n\r\n\r\n2  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nalle  die  Produkte  zu  beleuchten,  die  hier  auf  einmal  zu- \r\nsammen gefunden  werden;  doch  der  Trieb,  die  Unruhe, \r\ndie  hinter  mir  ist,  läßt  mich  nicht  rasten,  und  ich  eile \r\nsogleich  wieder  fort.  Dabei  kann  ich  mich  trösten,  daß \r\nin  unsern  statistischen  Zeiten  dies  alles  wohl  schon  ge- \r\ndruckt ist  und  man  sich  gelegentlich  davon  aus  Büchern \r\nunterrichten  kann.  Mir  ist  jetzt  nur  um  die  sinnlichen \r\nEindrücke  zu  tun,  die  kein  Buch,  kein  Bild  gibt.  Die \r\nSache  ist,  daß  ich  wieder  Interesse  an  der  Welt  nehme, \r\nmeinen  Beobachtungsgeist  versuche  und  prüfe,  wie  weit \r\nes  mit  meinen  Wissenschaften  und  Kenntnissen  geht,  ob \r\nmein  Auge  licht,  rein  und  hell  ist,  wie  viel  ich  in  der  Ge- \r\nschwindigkeit fassen  kann,  und  ob  die  Falten,  die  sich  in \r\nmein  Gemüt  geschlagen  und  gedrückt  haben,  wieder  aus- \r\nzutilgen sind.  Schon  jetzt,  daß  ich  mich  selbst  bediene, \r\nimmer  aufmerksam,  immer  gegenwärtig  sein  muß,  gibt \r\nmir  diese  wenigen  Tage  her  eine  ganz  andere  Elastizität \r\ndes  Geistes;  ich  muß  mich  um  den  Geldkurs  bekümmern, \r\nwechseln,  bezahlen,  notieren,  schreiben,  anstatt  daß  ich \r\nsonst  nur  dachte,  wollte,  sann,  befahl  und  diktierte. \r\nVon  Bozen  auf  Trient  geht  es  neun  Meilen  weg  in  einem \r\nfruchtbaren  und  fruchtbareren  Tale  hin.  Alles,  was  auf \r\nden  höheren  Gebirgen  zu  vegetieren  versucht,  hat  hier \r\nschon  mehr  Kraft  und  Leben,  die  Sonne  scheint  heiß,  und \r\nman  glaubt  wieder  einmal  an  einen  Gott. \r\nEine  arme  Frau  rief  mich  an,  ich  möchte  ihr  Kind  in  den \r\nWagen  nehmen,  weil  ihm  der  heiße  Boden  die  Füße  ver- \r\nbrenne. Ich  übte  diese  Mildtätigkeit  zu  Ehren  des  ge- \r\nwaltigen Himmelslichtes.  Das  Kind  war  sonderbar  geputzt \r\nund  aufgeziert,  ich  konnte  ihm  aber  in  keiner  Sprache \r\netwas  abgewinnen. \r\n\r\nDie  Etsch  fließt  nun  sanfter  und  macht  an  vielen  Orten \r\nbreite  Kiese.  Auf  dem  Lande,  nah  am  Fluß,  die  Hügel \r\nhinauf,  ist  alles  so  enge  an  und  in  einander  gepflanzt,  daß \r\nman  denkt,  es  müsse  eins  das  andere  ersticken:  Weinge- \r\nländer, Mais,  Maulbeerbäume,  Äpfel,  Birnen,  Quitten  und \r\nNüsse.  Über  Mauern  wirft  sich  der  Attich  lebhaft  herüber. \r\nEfeu  wächst  in  starken  Stämmen  die  Felsen  hinauf  und \r\nverbreitet  sich  weit  über  sie;  die  Eidechse  schlüpft  durch \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  29 \r\n\r\ndie  Zwischenräume;  auch  alles,  was  hin  und  her  wandelt, \r\nerinnert  einen  an  die  liebsten  Kunstbilder.  Die  aufge- \r\nbundenen Zöpfe  der  Frauen,  der  Männer  bloße  Brust  und \r\nleichte  Jacken,  die  trefflichen  Ochsen,  die  sie  vom  Markt \r\nnach  Hause  treiben,  die  beladenen  Eselchen,  alles  bildet \r\neinen  lebendigen,  bewegten  Heinrich  Roos.  Und  nun, \r\nwenn  es  Abend  wird,  bei  der  milden  Luft  wenige  Wolken \r\nan  den  Bergen  ruhen,  am  Himmel  mehr  stehen  als  ziehen, \r\nund  gleich  nach  Sonnenuntergang  das  Geschrille  der  Heu- \r\nschrecken laut  zu  werden  anfängt,  da  fühlt  man  sich  doch \r\neinmal  in  der  Welt  zu  Hause  und  nicht  wie  geborgt  oder \r\nim  Exil.  Ich  lasse  mir's  gefallen,  als  wenn  ich  hier  ge- \r\nboren und  erzogen  wäre  und  nun  von  einer  Grönlands- \r\nfahrt, von  einem  Walfischfange  zurückkäme.  Auch  der \r\nvaterländische  Staub,  der  manchmal  den  Wagen  umwirbelt, \r\nvon  dem  ich  so  lange  nichts  erfahren  habe,  wird  begrüßt. \r\nDas  Glocken-  und  Schellengeläute  der  Heuschrecken  ist \r\nallerliebst,  durchdringend  und  nicht  unangenehm.  Lustig \r\nklingt  es,  wenn  mutwillige  Buben  mit  einem  Feld  solcher \r\nSängerinnen  um  die  Wette  pfeifen;  man  bildet  sich  ein, \r\ndaß  sie  einander  wirklich  steigern.  Auch  der  Abend  ist \r\nvollkommen  milde,  wie  der  Tag. \r\n\r\nWenn  mein  Entzücken  hierüber  jemand  vernähme,  der \r\nin  Süden  wohnte,  von  Süden  herkäme,  er  würde  mich  für \r\nsehr  kindisch  halten.  Ach,  was  ich  hier  ausdrücke,  habe \r\nich  lange  gewußt,  so  lange  als  ich  unter  einem  bösen \r\nHimmel  dulde;  und  jetzt  mag  ich  gern  diese  Freude  als \r\nAusnahme  fühlen,  die  wir  als  eine  ewige  Naturnotwendig- \r\nkeit immer  fort  genießen  sollten. \r\n\r\nTrient,  den  11.  September,  abends. \r\nIch  bin  in  der  Stadt  herumgegangen,  die  uralt  ist  und  in \r\neinigen  Straßen  neue  wohlgebaute  Häuser  hat.  In  der \r\nKirche  hängt  ein  Bild,  wo  das  versammelte  Konzilium \r\neiner  Predigt  des  Jesuitengenerals  zuhört.  Ich  möchte \r\nwohl  wissen,  was  er  ihnen  aufgebunden  hat.  Die  Kirche \r\ndieser  Väter  bezeichnet  sich  gleich  von  außen  durch  rote \r\nMarmorpilaster  an  der  Fassade;  ein  schwerer  Vorhang \r\nschließt  die  Türe,  den  Staub  abzuhalten.    Ich  hob  ihn \r\n\r\n\r\n30  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nauf  und  trat  in  eine  kleine  Vorkirche;  die  Kirche  selbst \r\nist  durch  ein  eisernes  Gitter  geschlossen,  doch  so,  daß \r\nman  sie  ganz  übersehen  kann.  Es  war  alles  still  und  aus- \r\ngestorben, denn  es  wird  hier  kein  Gottesdienst  mehr  ge- \r\nhalten. Die  vordere  Türe  stand  nur  auf,  weil  zur  Vesper- \r\nzeit alle  Kirchen  geöftnet  sein  sollen. \r\nWie  ich  nun  so  dastehe  und  der  Bauart  nachdenke,  die \r\nich  den  übrigen  Kirchen  dieser  Väter  ähnlich  fand,  tritt \r\nein  alter  Mann  herein,  das  schwarze  Käppchen  sogleich \r\nabnehmend.  Sein  alter  schwarzer,  vergrauter  Rock  deu- \r\ntete auf  einen  verkümmerten  Geistlichen;  er  kniet  vor \r\ndem  Gitter  nieder  und  steht  nach  einem  kurzen  Gebet \r\nwieder  auf.  Wie  er  sich  umkehrt,  sagt  er  halblaut  für \r\nsich:  Da  haben  sie  nun  die  Jesuiten  herausgetrieben,  sie \r\nhätten  ihnen  auch  zahlen  sollen,  was  die  Kirche  gekostet \r\nhat;  ich  weiß  wohl,  was  sie  gekostet  hat  und  das  Semi- \r\nnarium,  wie  viele  Tausende.  Indessen  war  er  hinaus  und \r\nhinter  ihm  der  Vorhang  zugefallen,  den  ich  lüftete  und \r\nmich  still  hielt.  Er  war  auf  der  obem  Stufe  stehen  ge- \r\nblieben und  sagte:  Der  Kaiser  hat  es  nicht  getan,  der \r\nPapst  hat  es  getan.  Mit  dem  Gesicht  gegen  die  Straße \r\ngekehrt  und  ohne  mich  zu  vermuten,  fuhr  er  fort:  Erst \r\ndie  Spanier,  dann  wir,  dann  die  Franzosen;  Abels  Blut \r\nschreit  über  seinen  Bruder  Kain!  Und  so  ging  er  die \r\nTreppe  hinab,  immer  mit  sich  redend,  die  Straße  hin. \r\nWahrscheinlich  ist  es  ein  Mann,  den  die  Jesuiten  erhielten \r\nund  der  über  den  Ungeheuern  Fall  des  Ordens  den  Ver- \r\nstand verlor  und  nun  täglich  kommt,  in  dem  leeren  Ge- \r\nfäß die  alten  Bewohner  zu  suchen  und  nach  einem  kurzen \r\nGebet  ihren  Feinden  den  Fluch  zu  geben. \r\nEin  junger  Mann,  den  ich  um  die  Merkwürdigkeiten  der \r\nStadt  fragte,  zeigte  mir  ein  Haus,  das  man  des  Teufels \r\nHaus  nennt,  welches  der  sonst  allzeitfertige  Zerstörer  in \r\neiner  Nacht  mit  schnell  herbeigeschaftten  Steinen  erbaut \r\nhaben  soll.  Das  eigentliche  Merkwürdige  daran  bemerkte \r\nder  gute  Mensch  aber  nicht,  daß  es  nämlich  das  einzige \r\nHaus  von  gutem  Geschmack  ist,  das  ich  in  Trient  ge- \r\nsehen habe,  in  einer  altern  Zeit  gewiß  von  einem  guten \r\nItaliener  aufgeführt. \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  31 \r\n\r\nAbends  um  fünf  Uhr  reiste  ich  ab;  wieder  das  Schauspiel \r\nvon  gestern  abend  und  die  Heuschrecken,  die  gleich  bei \r\nSonnenuntergang  zu  schrillen  anfangen.  Wohl  eine  Meile \r\nweit  fährt  man  zwischen  Mauern,  über  welche  sich \r\nTraubengeländer  sehen  lassen;  andere  Mauern,  die  nicht \r\nhoch  genug  sind,  hat  man  mit  Steinen,  Dornen  und  sonst \r\nzu  erhöhen  gesucht,  um  das  Abrupfen  der  Trauben  den \r\nVorbeigehenden  zu  wehren.  Viele  Besitzer  bespritzen  die \r\nvordersten  Reihen  mit  Kalk,  der  die  Trauben  ungenieß- \r\nbar macht,  dem  Wein  aber  nichts  schadet,  weil  die \r\nGärung  alles  wieder  heraustreibt. \r\n\r\nDen  II.  September,  abends. \r\nHier  bin  ich  nun  in  Roveredo,  wo  die  Sprache  sich  ab- \r\nschneidet; oben  herein  schwankt  es  noch  immer  vom \r\nDeutschen  zum  Italienischen.  Nun  hatte  ich  zum  ersten- \r\nmal einen  stockwelschen  Postillion,  der  Wirt  spricht  kein \r\nDeutsch,  und  ich  muß  nun  meine  Sprachkünste  versuchen. \r\nWie  froh  bin  ich,  daß  nunmehr  die  geliebte  Sprache \r\nlebendig,  die  Sprache  des  Gebrauchs  wird, \r\n\r\nTorbole,  den  12.  September  nach  Tische. \r\nWie  sehr  wünschte  ich  meine  Freunde  einen  Augenblick \r\nneben  mich,  daß  sie  sich  der  Aussicht  freuen  könnten, \r\ndie  vor  mir  liegt. \r\n\r\nHeute  abend  hätte  ich  können  in  Verona  sein,  aber  es \r\nlag  mir  noch  eine  herrliche  Naturwirkung  an  der  Seite, \r\nein  köstliches  Schauspiel,  der  Gardasee;  den  wollte  ich \r\nnicht  versäumen,  und  bin  herrlich  für  meinen  Umweg \r\nbelohnt.  Nach  fünfen  fuhr  ich  von  Roveredo  fort,  ein \r\nSeitental  hinauf,  das  seine  Wasser  noch  in  die  Etsch  gießt. \r\nWenn  man  hinauf  kommt,  liegt  ein  ungeheurer  Felsriegel \r\nhinten  vor,  über  den  man  nach  dem  See  hinunter  muß \r\nHier  zeigten  sich  die  schönsten  Kalkfelsen  zu  malerischen \r\nStudien.  Wenn  man  hinab  kommt,  liegt  ein  Örtchen  am \r\nnördlichen  Ende  des  Sees,  und  ist  ein  kleiner  Hafen  oder \r\nvielmehr  Anfahrt  daselbst;  es  heißt  Torbole.  Die  Feigen- \r\nbäume hatten  mich  schon  den  Weg   herauf  häufig   be- \r\n\r\n\r\n32  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  1 \r\n\r\ngleitet,  und  indem  ich  in  das  Fels-Amphitheater  hinab- \r\nstieg, fand  ich  die  ersten  Ölbäume  voller  Oliven.  Hier \r\ntraf  ich  auch  zum  erstenmal  die  weißen  kleinen  Feigen \r\nals  gemeine  Frucht,  welche  mir  die  Gräfin  Lanthieri  ver- \r\nheißen hatte. \r\n\r\nAus  dem  Zimmer,  in  dem  ich  sitze,  geht  eine  Türe  nach \r\ndem  Hof  hinunter;  ich  habe  meinen  Tisch  davor  gerückt \r\nund  die  Aussicht  mit  einigen  Linien  gezeichnet.  Man \r\nübersieht  den  See  beinah  in  seiner  ganzen  Länge,  nur \r\nam  Ende  links  entwendet  er  sich  unsern  Augen.  Das  Ufer, \r\nauf  beiden  Seiten  von  Hügeln  und  Bergen  eingefaßt, \r\nglänzt  von  unzähligen  kleinen  Ortschaften. \r\nNach  Mitternacht  bläst  der  Wind  von  Norden  nach  Süden: \r\nwer  also  den  See  hinab  will,  muß  zu  dieser  Zeit  fahren; \r\ndenn  schon  einige  Stunden  vor  Sonnenaufgang  wendet \r\nsich  der  Luftstrom  und  zieht  nordwärts.  Jetzo,  Nach- \r\nmittag, wehet  er  stark  gegen  mich  und  kühlt  die  heiße \r\nSonne  gar  lieblich.  Zugleich  lehrt  mich  Volkmann,  daß \r\ndieser  See  ehemals  Benacus  geheißen,  und  bringt  einen \r\nVers  des  Virgil,  worin  dessen  gedacht  wird: \r\n\r\nFluctibus  et  fremitu  re.sonans  Benace  marino. \r\nDer  erste  lateinische  Vers,  dessen  Inhalt  lebendig  vor  mir \r\nsteht  und  der  in  dem  Augenblicke,  da  der  Wind  immer \r\nstärker  wächst  und  der  See  höhere  Wellen  gegen  die  An- \r\nfahrt wirft,  noch  heute  so  wahr  ist  als  vor  vielen  Jahr- \r\nhunderten. So  manches  hat  sich  verändert,  noch  aber \r\nstürmt  der  Wind  in  dem  See,  dessen  Anblick  eine  Zeile \r\nVirgils  noch  immer  veredelt. \r\n\r\nGeschrieben  unter  dem  fünfundvierzigsten  Grade  fünfzig \r\nMinuten. \r\n\r\nIn  der  Abendkühle  ging  ich  spazieren  und  befinde  mich \r\nnun  wirklich  in  einem  neuen  Lande,  in  einer  ganz  frem- \r\nden Umgebung.  Die  Menschen  leben  ein  nachlässiges \r\nSchlaraffenleben:  erstlich  haben  die  Türen  keine  Schlösser; \r\nder  Wirt  aber  versicherte  mir,  ich  könne  ganz  ruhig  sein, \r\nund  wenn  alles,  was  ich  bei  mir  hätte,  aus  Diamanten \r\nbestünde;  zweitens  sind  die  Fenster  mit  Ölpapier  statt \r\nGlasscheiben  geschlossen;  drittens  fehlt  eine  höchst  nötige \r\nBequemlichkeit,    so  daß   man   dem   Naturzustande   hier \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  33 \r\n\r\nziemlich  nahe  kömmt.  Als  ich  den  Hausknecht  nach  einer \r\ngewissen  Gelegenheit  fragte,  deutete  er  in  den  Hof  hin- \r\nunter: Qui  abasso  puo  servirsi!  Ich  fragte:  Dove? — Da \r\nper  tutto,  dove  vuol!  antwortete  er  freundlich.  Durch- \r\naus zeigt  sich  die  größte  Sorglosigkeit,  doch  Leben  und \r\nGeschäftigkeit  genug.  Den  ganzen  Tag  verführen  die \r\nNachbarinnen  ein  Geschwätz,  ein  Geschrei,  und  haben \r\nalle  zugleich  etwas  zu  tun,  etwas  zu  schaften.  Ich  habe \r\nnoch  kein  müßiges  Weib  gesehn. \r\n\r\nDer  Wirt  verkündigte  mir  mit  italienischer  Emphase,  daß \r\ner  sich  glücklich  finde,  mir  mit  der  köstlichsten  Forelle \r\ndienen  zu  können.  Sie  werden  bei  Torbole  gefangen,  wo \r\nder  Bach  vom  Gebirge  herunter  kommt  und  der  Fisch \r\nden  Weg  hinauf  sucht.  Der  Kaiser  erhält  von  diesem \r\nFange  zehntausend  Gulden  Pacht.  Es  sind  keine  eigent- \r\nlichen Forellen,  groß,  manchmal  fünfzig  Pfund  schwer, \r\nüber  den  ganzen  Körper  bis  auf  den  Kopf  hinauf  punk- \r\ntiert: der  Geschmack  zwischen  Forelle  und  Lachs,  zart \r\nund  trefflich. \r\n\r\nMein  eigentlich  Wohlleben  aber  ist  in  Früchten,  in  Feigen, \r\nauch  Birnen,  welche  da  wohl  köstlich  sein  müssen,  wo \r\nschon  Zitronen  wachsen. \r\n\r\nDen  13.  Scpk/iibtr  abends. \r\nHeute  früh  um  drei  Uhr  fuhr  ich  von  Torbole  weg,  mit \r\nzwei  Ruderern.  Anfangs  war  der  Wind  günstig,  daß  sie \r\ndie  Segel  brauchen  konnten.  Der  Morgen  war  herrlich, \r\nzwar  wolkig,  doch  bei  der  Dämmrung  still.  Wir  fuhren \r\nbei  Limone  vorbei,  dessen  Berggärten,  terrassenweise \r\nangelegt  und  mit  Zitronenbäumen  bepflanzt,  ein  reiches \r\nund  reinliches  Ansehen  geben.  Der  ganze  Garten  besteht \r\naus  Reihen  von  weißen  viereckigen  Pfeilern,  die  in  einer \r\ngewissen  Entfernung  voneinander  stehen  und  stufenweis \r\nden  Berg  hinaufrücken.  Über  diese  Pfeiler  sind  starke \r\nStangen  gelegt,  um  im  Winter  die  dazwischen  gepflanzten \r\nBäume  zu  decken.  Das  Betrachten  und  Beschauen  dieser \r\nangenehmen  Gegenstände  ward  durch  eine  langsame \r\nFahrt  begünstigt,  und  so  waren  wir  schon  an  Malcesine \r\nvorbei,  als  der  Wind  sich  völlig  umkehrte,  seinen  gewöhn- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  5 \r\n\r\n\r\n34  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nliehen  Tagweg  nahm  und  nach  Norden  zog.  Das  Rudern \r\nhalf  wenig  gegen  die  übennächtige  Gewalt,  und  so  mußten \r\nwir  im  Hafen  von  Malcesine  landen.  Es  ist  der  erste \r\nvenezianische  Ort  an  der  Morgenseite  des  Sees.  Wenn \r\nman  mit  dem  Wasser  zu  tun  hat,  kann  man  nicht  sagen: \r\nich  werde  heute  da  oder  dort  sein.  Diesen  Aufenthalt \r\nwill  ich  so  gut  als  möglich  nutzen,  besonders  das  Schloß \r\nzu  zeichnen,  das  am  Wasser  liegt  und  ein  schöner  Gegen- \r\nstand ist.  Heute  im  Vorbeifahren  nahm  ich  eine  Skizze \r\ndavon. \r\n\r\nDen  14.  September. \r\nDer  Gegenwind,  der  mich  gestern  in  den  Hafen  von \r\nMalcesine  trieb,  bereitete  mir  ein  gefährliches  Abenteuer, \r\nwelches  ich  mit  gutem  Humor  überstand  und  in  der  Er- \r\ninnerung lustig  finde.  Wie  ich  mir  vorgenommen  hatte, \r\nging  ich  morgens  beizeiten  in  das  alte  Schloß,  welches \r\nohne  Tore,  ohne  Verwahrung  und  Bewachung,  jedermann \r\nzugänglich  ist.  Im  Schloßhofe  setzte  ich  mich  dem  alten, \r\nauf  und  in  den  Felsen  gebauten  Turm  gegenüber;  hier \r\nhatte  ich  zum  Zeichnen  ein  sehr  bequemes  Plätzchen  ge- \r\nfunden: neben  einer  drei,  vier  Stufen  erhöhten  ver- \r\nschlossenen Türe  im  Türgewände  ein  verziertes  steinernes \r\nSitzchen,  wie  wir  sie  wohl  bei  uns  in  alten  Gebäuden \r\nauch  noch  antreffen. \r\n\r\nIch  saß  nicht  lange,  so  kamen  verschiedene  Menschen \r\nin  den  Hof  herein,  betrachteten  mich  und  fingen  hin  und \r\nwieder.  Die  Menge  vermehrte  sich,  blieb  endlich  stehen, \r\nso  daß  sie  mich  zuletzt  umgab.  Ich  bemerkte  wohl,  daß \r\nmein  Zeichnen  Aufsehen  erregt  hatte;  ich  ließ  mich  aber \r\nnicht  stören  und  fuhr  ganz  gelassen  fort.  Endlich  drängte \r\nsich  ein  Mann  zu  mir,  nicht  von  dem  besten  Ansehen, \r\nund  fragte,  was  ich  da  mache.  Ich  erwiderte  ihm,  daß \r\nich  den  alten  Turm  abzeichne,  um  mir  ein  Andenken  von \r\nMalcesine  zu  erhalten.  Er  sagte  darauf,  es  sei  dies  nicht \r\nerlaubt,  und  ich  sollte  es  unterlassen.  Da  er  dieses  in \r\ngemeiner  venezianischer  Sprache  sagte,  so  daß  ich  ihn \r\nwirklich  kaum  verstand,  so  erwiderte  ich  ihm,  daß  ich \r\nihn  nicht  verstehe.    Er  ergrift\"  darauf  mit  wahrer  italie- \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  35 \r\n\r\nnischer  Gelassenheit  mein  Blatt,  zerriß  es,  ließ  es  aber \r\nauf  der  Pappe  liegen.  Hierauf  könnt'  ich  einen  Ton  der \r\nUnzufriedenheit  unter  den  Umstehenden  bemerken,  be- \r\nsonders sagte  eine  ältliche  Frau,  es  sei  nicht  recht!  man \r\nsolle  den  Podesta  rufen,  welcher  dergleichen  Dinge  zu \r\nbeurteilen  wisse.  Ich  stand  auf  meinen  Stufen,  den \r\nRücken  gegen  die  Türe  gelehnt,  und  überschaute  das \r\nimmer  sich  vermehrende  Publikum.  Die  neugierigen \r\nstarren  Blicke,  der  gutmütige  Ausdruck  in  den  meisten \r\nGesichtern,  und  was  sonst  noch  alles  eine  fremde  Volks- \r\nmasse charakterisieren  mag,  gab  mir  den  lustigsten  Ein- \r\ndruck. Ich  glaubte  das  Chor  der  Vögel  vor  mir  zu  sehen, \r\ndas  ich  als  Treufreund  auf  dem  Ettersburger  Theater  oft \r\nzum  besten  gehabt.  Dies  versetzte  mich  in  die  heiterste \r\nStimmung,  so  daß,  als  der  Podesta  mit  seinem  Aktuarius \r\nherankam,  ich  ihn  freimütig  begrüßte  und  auf  seine  Frage, \r\nwarum  ich  ihre  Festung  abzeichnete,  ihm  bescheiden  er- \r\nwiderte, daß  ich  dieses  Gemäuer  nicht  für  eine  Festung \r\nanerkenne.  Ich  machte  ihn  und  das  Volk  aufmerksam \r\nauf  den  Verfall  dieser  Türme  und  dieser  Mauern,  auf  den \r\nMangel  von  Toren,  kurz  auf  die  Wehrlosigkeit  des  ganzen \r\nZustandes,  und  versicherte,  ich  habe  hier  nichts  als  eine \r\nRuine  zu  sehen  und  zu  zeichnen  gedacht. \r\nMan  entgegnete  mir:  wenn  es  eine  Ruine  sei,  was  denn \r\ndran  wohl  merkwürdig  scheinen  könne?  Ich  erwiderte \r\ndarauf,  weil  ich  Zeit  und  Gunst  zu  gewinnen  suchte,  sehr \r\numständlich,  daß  sie  wüßten,  wie  viele  Reisende  nur  um \r\nder  Ruinen  willen  nach  Italien  zögen,  daß  Rom,  die \r\nHauptstadt  der  Welt,  von  den  Barbaren  verwüstet,  voller \r\nRuinen  stehe,  welche  hundert-  und  aber  hundertmal  ge- \r\nzeichnet worden,  daß  nicht  alles  aus  dem  Altertum  so \r\nerhalten  sei  wie  das  Amphitheater  zu  Verona,  welches \r\nich  denn  auch  bald  zu  sehen  hoftte. \r\nDer  Podesta,  welcher  vor  mir,  aber  tiefer  stand,  war  ein \r\nlanger,  nicht  gerade  hagerer  Mann  von  etwa  dreißig \r\nJahren.  Die  stumpfen  Züge  seines  geistlosen  Gesichts \r\nstimmten  ganz  zu  der  langsamen  und  trüben  Weise,  wo- \r\nmit er  seine  Fragen  hervorbrachte.  Der  Aktuarius,  kleiner \r\nund  gewandter,  schien  sich  in  einen  so  neuen  und  seltnen \r\n\r\n\r\n36  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nFall  auch  nicht  gleich  finden  zu  können.  Ich  sprach  noch \r\nmanches  dergleichen,  man  schien  mich  gern  zu  hören, \r\nluid  indem  ich  mich  an  einige  wohlwollende  Frauenge- \r\nsichter wendete,  glaubte  ich  Beistimmung  und  Billigung \r\nwahrzunehmen. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  jedoch  des  Amphitheaters  zu  Verona  erwähnte, \r\ndas  man  im  Lande  unter  dem  Namen  Arena  kennt,  sagte \r\nder  Aktuarius,  der  sich  unterdessen  besonnen  hatte,  das \r\nmöge  wohl  gelten,  denn  jenes  sei  ein  weltberühmtes, \r\nrömisches  Gebäude;  an  diesen  Türmen  aber  sei  nichts \r\nMerkwürdiges,  als  daß  es  die  Grenze  zwischen  dem  Ge- \r\nbiete Venedigs  und  dem  östreichischen  Kaiserstaate  be- \r\nzeichne und  deshalb  nicht  ausspioniert  werden  solle.  Ich \r\nerklärte  mich  dagegen  weitläufig,  daß  nicht  allein  grie- \r\nchische und  römische  Altertümer,  sondern  auch  die  der \r\nmittlem  Zeit  Aufmerksamkeit  verdienten.  Ihnen  sei \r\nfreilich  nicht  zu  verargen,  daß  sie  an  diesem  von  Jugend \r\nauf  gekannten  Gebäude  nicht  so  viele  malerische  Schön- \r\nheiten als  ich  entdecken  könnten.  Glücklicherweise  setzte \r\ndie  Morgensonne  Turm,  Felsen  und  Mauern  in  das \r\nschönste  Licht,  und  ich  fing  an,  ihnen  dieses  Bild  mit \r\nEnthusiasmus  zu  beschreiben.  Weil  aber  mein  Publikum \r\njene  belobten  Gegenstände  im  Rücken  hatte  und  sich \r\nnicht  ganz  von  mir  abwenden  wollte,  so  drehten  sie  auf \r\neinmal,  jenen  Vögeln  gleich,  die  man  Wendehälse  nennt, \r\ndie  Köpfe  herum,  dasjenige  mit  Augen  zu  schauen,  was \r\nich  ihren  Ohren  anpries,  ja  der  Podesta  selbst  kehrte  sich, \r\nobgleich  mit  etwas  mehr  Anstand,  nach  dem  beschrie- \r\nbenen Bilde  hin.  Diese  Szene  kam  mir  so  lächerlich  vor, \r\ndaß  mein  guter  Mut  sich  vermehrte  und  ich  ihnen  nichts, \r\nam  wenigsten  den  Efeu  schenkte,  der  Fels  und  Gemäuer \r\nauf  das  reichste  zu  verzieren  schon  Jahrhunderte  Zeit  ge- \r\nhabt hatte. \r\n\r\nDer  Aktuarius  versetzte  drauf,  das  lasse  sich  alles  hören, \r\naber  Kaiser  Joseph  sei  ein  unruhiger  Herr,  der  gewiß \r\ngegen  die  Republik  Venedig  noch  manches  Böse  im \r\nSchilde  führe,  und  ich  möchte  wohl  sein  Untertan,  ein \r\nAbgeordneter  sein,  um  die  Grenzen  auszuspähen. \r\nWeit  entfernt,  rief  ich  aus,  dem  Kaiser  anzugehören,  darf \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  1786  37 \r\n\r\nich  mich  wohl  rühmen,  so  gut  als  ihr,  Bürger  einer \r\nRepublik  zu  sein,  welche  zwar  an  Macht  und  Größe  dem \r\nerlauchten  Staat  von  Venedig  nicht  verglichen  werden  kann, \r\naber  doch  auch  sich  selbst  regiert  und  an  Handelstätig- \r\nkeit, Reichtum  und  Weisheit  ihrer  Vorgesetzten  keiner \r\nStadt  in  Deutschland  nachsteht.  Ich  bin  nämlich  von \r\nFrankfurt  am  Main  gebürtig,  einer  Stadt,  deren  Name  und \r\nRuf  gewiß  bis  zu  euch  gekommen  ist. \r\nVon  Frankfurt  am  IMain!  rief  eine  hübsche  junge  Frau: \r\nda  könnt  Ihr  gleich  sehen,  Herr  Podesta,  was  an  dem \r\nFremden  ist,  den  ich  für  einen  guten  Mann  halte;  laßt \r\nden  Gregorio  rufen,  der  lange  daselbst  konditioniert  hat, \r\nder  wird  am  besten  in  der  Sache  entscheiden  können. \r\nSchon  hatten  sich  die  wohlwollenden  Gesichter  um  mich \r\nher  vermehrt,  der  erste  Widerwärtige  war  verschwunden, \r\nund  als  nun  Gregorio  herbeikam,  wendete  sich  die  Sache \r\nganz  zu  meinem  Vorteil.  Dieser  war  ein  Mann  etwa  in \r\nden  Funfzigen,  ein  braunes  italienisches  Gesicht,  wie  man \r\nsie  kennt.  Er  sprach  und  betrug  sich  als  einer,  dem  etwas \r\nFremdes  nicht  fremd  ist,  erzählte  mir  sogleich,  daß  er \r\nbei  Bolongaro  in  Diensten  gestanden  und  sich  freue,  durch \r\nmich  etwas  von  dieser  Familie  und  von  der  Stadt  zu \r\nhören,  an  die  er  sich  mit  Vergnügen  erinnere.  Glück- \r\nlicherweise war  sein  Aufenthalt  in  meine  jüngeren  Jahre \r\ngefallen,  und  ich  hatte  den  doppelten  Vorteil,  ihm  genau \r\nsagen  zu  können,  wie  es  zu  seiner  Zeit  gewesen,  und  was \r\nsich  nachher  verändert  habe.  Ich  erzählte  ihm  von  den \r\nsämtlichen  italienischen  Familien,  deren  mir  keine  fremd \r\ngeblieben;  er  war  sehr  vergnügt,  manches  einzelne  zu \r\nhören,  zum  Beispiel  daß  der  Herr  Allesina  im  Jahr  1774 \r\nseine  goldene  Hochzeit  gefeiert,  daß  darauf  eine  Medaille \r\ngeschlagen  worden,  die  ich  selbst  besitze;  er  erinnerte \r\nsich  recht  wohl,  daß  die  Gattin  dieses  reichen  Handels- \r\nherrn eine  geborne  Brentano  sei.  Auch  von  den  Kindern \r\nund  Enkeln  dieser  Häuser  wußte  ich  ihm  zu  erzählen, \r\nwie  sie  herangewachsen,  versorgt,  verheiratet  worden  und \r\nsich  in  Enkeln  vermehrt  hätten. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  ihm  nun  die  genauste  Auskunft  fast  über  alles \r\ngegeben,  um  was  er  mich  befragt,  wechselten  Heiterkeit \r\n\r\n\r\n38  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nund  Ernst  in  den  Zügen  des  Mannes.  Er  war  froh  und \r\ngerührt;  das  Volk  erheiterte  sich  immer  mehr  und  konnte \r\nunserm  Zwiegespräch  zuzuhören  nicht  satt  werden,  wo- \r\nvon er  freilich  einen  Teil  erst  in  ihren  Dialekt  übersetzen \r\nmußte. \r\n\r\nZuletzt  sagte  er:  Herr  Podesta,  ich  bin  überzeugt,  daß \r\ndieses  ein  braver,  kunstreicher  Mann  ist,  wohlerzogen, \r\nwelcher  herumreist,  sich  zu  unterrichten.  Wir  wollen  ihn \r\nfreundlich  entlassen,  damit  er  bei  seinen  Landsleuten \r\nGutes  von  uns  rede  und  sie  aufmuntere,  Malcesine  zu \r\nbesuchen,  dessen  schöne  Lage  wohl  wert  ist,  von  Fremden \r\nbewundert  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nIch  verstärkte  diese  freundlichen  Worte  durch  das  Lob \r\nder  Gegend,  der  Lage  und  der  Einwohner,  die  Gerichts- \r\npersonen als  weise  und  vorsichtige  Männer  nicht  ver- \r\ngessend. \r\n\r\nDieses  alles  ward  für  gut  erkannt,  und  ich  erhielt  die \r\nErlaubnis,  mit  Meister  Gregorio  nach  Belieben  den  Ort \r\nund  die  Gegend  zu  besehen.  Der  Wirt,  bei  dem  ich  ein- \r\ngekehrt war,  gesellte  sich  nun  zu  uns  und  freute  sich \r\nschon  auf  die  Fremden,  welche  auch  ihm  zuströmen \r\nwürden,  wenn  die  Vorzüge  Malcesines  erst  recht  ans \r\nLicht  kämen.  Mit  lebhafter  Neugierde  betrachtete  er \r\nmeine  Kleidungsstücke,  besonders  aber  beneidete  er  mich \r\num  die  kleinen  Terzerole,  die  man  so  bequem  in  die \r\nTasche  stecken  konnte.  Er  pries  diejenigen  glücklich, \r\ndie  so  schöne  Gewehre  tragen  dürften,  welches  bei  ihnen \r\nunter  den  peinlichsten  Strafen  verboten  sei.  Diesen \r\nfreundlich  Zudringlichen  unterbrach  ich  einigemal,  meinem \r\nBefreier  mich  dankbar  zu  erweisen. \r\n\r\nDankt  mir  nicht,  versetzte  der  brave  Mann,  mir  seid  Ihr \r\nnichts  schuldig.  Verstünde  der  Podesta  sein  Handwerk, \r\nund  wäre  der  Aktuar  nicht  der  eigennützigste  aller \r\nMenschen,  Ihr  wäret  nicht  so  losgekommen.  Jener  war \r\nverlegner  als  Ihr,  und  diesem  hätte  Eure  Verhaftung,  die \r\nBerichte,  die  Abführung  nach  Verona  auch  nicht  einen \r\nHeller  eingetragen.  Das  hat  er  geschwind  überlegt,  und \r\nIhr  wart  schon  befreit,  ehe  unsere  Unterredung  zu  Ende \r\nwar. \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  17 86  39 \r\n\r\nGegen  Abend  holte  mich  der  gute  Mann  in  seinen  Wein- \r\nberg ab,  der  den  See  hinabwärts  sehr  wohlgelegen  war. \r\nUns  begleitete  sein  fünfzehnjähriger  Sohn,  der  auf  die \r\nBäume  steigen  und  mir  das  beste  Obst  brechen  mußte, \r\nindessen  der  Alte  die  reifsten  Weintrauben  aussuchte. \r\nZwischen  diesen  beiden  weltfremden,  wohlwollenden \r\nMenschen,  in  der  unendhchen  Einsamkeit  dieses  Erd- \r\nwinkels ganz  allein,  fühlte  ich  denn  doch,  wenn  ich  die \r\nAbenteuer  des  Tages  überdachte,  auf  das  lebhafteste, \r\nwelch  ein  wunderliches  Wesen  der  Mensch  ist,  daß  er \r\ndasjenige,  was  er  mit  Sicherheit  und  Bequemlichkeit  in \r\nguter  Gesellschaft  genießen  könnte,  sich  oft  unbequem \r\nund  gefährlich  macht,  bloß  aus  der  Grille,  die  Welt  und \r\nihren  Inhalt  sich  auf  seine  besondere  Weise  zuzueignen. \r\nGegen  Mitternacht  begleitete  mich  mein  Wirt  an  die \r\nBarke,  das  Fruchtkörbchen  tragend,  welches  mir  Gregorio \r\nverehrt  hatte,  und  so  schied  ich,  mit  günstigem  Wind,  von \r\ndem  Ufer,  welches  mir  lästrygonisch  zu  werden  gedroht \r\nhatte. \r\n\r\nNun  von  meiner  Seefahrt!  Sie  endete  glücklich,  nach- \r\ndem die  Herrlichkeit  des  Wasserspiegels  und  des  daran \r\nliegenden  brescianischen  Ufers  mich  recht  im  Herzen  er- \r\nquickt hatte.  Da,  wo  an  der  Abendseite  das  Gebirge  auf- \r\nhört, steil  zu  sein,  und  die  Landschaft  flächer  nach  dem \r\nSee  fällt,  liegen  in  einer  Reihe,  in  einer  Länge  von  un- \r\ngefähr anderthalb  Stunden,  Gargnano,  Bogliacco,  Cecina, \r\nToscolano,  Maderno,  Gardone,  Salö,  alle  auch  wieder \r\nmeist  in  die  Länge  gezogen.  Keine  Worte  drücken  die \r\nAnmut  dieser  so  reich  bewohnten  Gegend  aus.  Früh  um \r\nzehen  Uhr  landete  ich  in  Bardolino,  lud  mein  Gepäck  auf \r\nein  Maultier  und  mich  auf  ein  anderes.  Nun  ging  der \r\nWeg  über  einen  Rücken,  der  das  Tal  der  Etsch  von  der \r\nSeevertiefung  scheidet.  Die  Urwasser  scheinen  hier  von \r\nbeiden  Seiten  gegeneinander  in  Ungeheuern  Strömungen \r\ngewirkt  und  diesen  kolossalen  Kieseldamm  aufgeführt  zu \r\nhaben.  Fruchtbares  Erdreich  ward  in  ruhigem  Epochen \r\ndarüber  geschlemmt;  aber  der  Ackersmann  ist  doch  stets \r\naufs  neue  von  denen   immer  wieder  hervordringenden \r\n\r\n\r\n40  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nGeschieben  geplagt.  Man  sucht  so  viel  als  möglich  ihrer \r\nlos  zu  werden,  baut  sie  reihen-  und  schichtenweise  über- \r\neinander und  bildet  dadurch  am  Wege  hin  sehr  dicke \r\nQuasimauern.  Die  Maulbeerbcäume  sehen,  wegen  Mangel \r\nan  Feuchtigkeit,  nicht  fröhlich  auf  dieser  Höhe.  An \r\nQuellen  ist  nicht  zu  denken.  Von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  trifft  man \r\nPfützen  zusammengeleiteten  Regenwassers,  woraus  die \r\nMaultiere,  auch  wohl  die  Treiber  ihren  Durst  löschen. \r\nUnten  am  Flusse  sind  Schöpfräder  angebracht,  um  die \r\ntiefer  liegenden  Pflanzungen  nach  Gefallen  zu  wässern. \r\nNun  aber  kann  die  Herrlichkeit  der  neuen  Gegend,  die \r\nman  beim  Herabsteigen  übersieht,  durch  Worte  nicht  dar- \r\ngestellt werden.  Es  ist  ein  Garten,  Meilen  lang  und  breit, \r\nder  am  Fuß  hoher  Gebirge  und  schroffer  Felsen,  ganz \r\nflach,  in  der  größten  Reinlichkeit  daliegt.  Und  so  kam \r\nich  denn  am  14.  September,  gegen  ein  Uhr,  hier  in  Verona \r\nan,  wo  ich  zuerst  noch  dieses  schreibe,  das  zweite  Stück \r\nmeines  Tagebuchs  schließe  und  hefte  und  gegen  Abend \r\nmit  freudigem  Geiste  das  Amphitheater  zu  sehen  hoffe. \r\nVon  der  Witterung  dieser  Tage  her  melde  ich  folgendes. \r\nI  )ie  Nacht  vom  neunten  auf  den  zehnten  war  abwechselnd \r\nhell  und  bedeckt,  der  Mond  behielt  immer  einen  Schein \r\num  sich.  Morgens,  gegen  fünf  Uhr,  überzog  sich  der \r\nganze  Himmel  mit  grauen,  nicht  schweren  Wolken,  die \r\nmit  dem  wachsenden  Tage  verschwanden.  Je  tiefer  ich \r\nhinabkam,  desto  schöner  war  das  Wetter.  Wie  nun  gar \r\nin  Pozcn  der  große  Gebirgsstock  mitternächtlich  blieb, \r\nzeigte  die  Luft  eine  ganz  andere  Beschaffenheit:  man  .sah \r\nnämlich  an  den  verschiedenen  Landschaftsgründen,  die \r\nsich  gar  lieblich  durch  ein  etwas  mehr  oder  weniger  Blau \r\nvoneinander  absonderten,  daß  die  Atmosphäre  voll  gleich \r\nausgeteilter  Dünste  sei,  welche  sie  zu  tragen  vermochte \r\nund  die  daher  weder  als  Tau  oder  Regen  niederfielen, \r\nnoch  als  Wolken  sich  sammelten.  Wie  ich  weiter  hinab- \r\nkam, konnte  ich  deutlich  bemerken,  daß  alle  Dünste,  die \r\naus  dem  Bozner  Tal,  alle  Wolkenstreifen,  die  von  den \r\nmittägigem  Bergen  aufsteigen,  nach  den  höhern  mitter- \r\nnächtigen Gegenden  zu  zogen,  sie  nicht  verdeckten,  aber \r\nin  eine  Art  Höherauch  einhüllten.  In  der  weitesten  Ferne, \r\n\r\n\r\nVOM  BRENNER  BIS  VERONA  17 86  41 \r\n\r\nüber  dem  Gebirg,  konnte  ich  eine  sogenannte  Wassergalle \r\nbemerken.  Von  Bozen  südwärts  haben  sie  den  ganzen \r\nSommer  das  schönste  Wetter  gehabt,  nur  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit \r\nein  wenig  Wasser  (sie  sagen  acqua,  um  den  gelinden  Regen \r\nauszudrücken)  und  dann  sogleich  wieder  Sonnenschein. \r\nAuch  gestern  fielen  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  einige  Tropfen,  und \r\ndie  Sonne  schien  immer  dazu.  Sie  haben  lange  kein  so \r\ngutes  Jahr  gehabt;  es  gerät  alles;  das  Üble  haben  sie  uns \r\nzugeschickt. \r\n\r\nDas  Gebirge,  die  Steinarten  erwähne  ich  nur  kürzlich; \r\ndenn  Ferbers  Reise  nach  Italien  und  Hacquets  durch  die \r\nAlpen  unterrichten  uns  genugsam  von  dieser  Wegstrecke. \r\nEine  Viertelstunde  vom  Brenner  ist  ein  Marmorbruch,  an \r\ndem  ich  in  der  Dämmerung  vorbeifuhr.  Er  mag  und  muß, \r\nwie  der  an  der  andern  Seite,  auf  Glimmerschiefer  auf- \r\nliegen. Diesen  fand  ich  bei  Collman,  als  es  Tag  ward; \r\nweiter  hinab  zeigten  sich  Porphyre  an.  Die  Felsen  waren \r\nso  prächtig  und  an  der  Chaussee  die  Haufen  so  gätlich \r\nzerschlagen,  daß  mau  gleich  Voigtische  Kabinettchen \r\ndaraus  hätte  bilden  und  verpacken  können.  Auch  kann  ich \r\nohne  Beschwerde  jeder  Art  ein  Stück  mitnehmen,  wenn  ich \r\nnur  Augen  und  Begierde  an  ein  kleineres  Maß  gewöhne. \r\nBald  unter  CoUraan  fand  ich  einen  Porphyr,  der  sich  in \r\nregelmäßige  Platten  spaltet,  zwischen  Branzoll  und  Neu- \r\nmarkt einen  ähnlichen,  dessen  Platten  jedoch  sich  wieder  in \r\nSäulen  trennen.  Ferber  hielt  sie  für  vulkanische  Produkte; \r\ndas  war  aber  vor  vierzehn  Jahren,  wo  die  ganze  Welt  in \r\nden  Köpfen  brannte.  Hacquet  schon  macht  sich  darüber \r\nlustig. \r\n\r\nVon  den  Menschen  wüßte  ich  nur  weniges  und  wenig  Er- \r\nfreuliches zu  sagen.  Sobald  mir  vom  Brenner  Herunter- \r\nfahrenden der  Tag  aufging,  bemerkte  ich  eine  entschiedene \r\nVeränderung  der  Gestalt,  besonders  mißfiel  mir  die  bräun- \r\nlich-bleiche Farbe  der  Weiber.  Ihre  Gesichtszüge  deuteten \r\nauf  Elend;  Kinder  waren  ebenso  erbärmlich  anzusehen, \r\n^Männer  eiuAvenig  besser;  die  Grundbildung  übrigens  durch- \r\naus regelmäßig  und  gut.  Ich  glaube  die  Ursache  dieses \r\nkrankhaften  Zustandes  in  dem  häufigen  Gebrauch  des  tür- \r\nkischen und  Heidekorns  zu  finden.    Jenes,  das  sie  auch \r\n\r\n\r\n42  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ngelbe  Blende  nennen,  und  dieses,  schwarze  Blende  ge- \r\nnannt, werden  gemahlen,  das  Mehl  in  Wasser  zu  einem \r\ndicken  Brei  gekocht  und  so  gegessen.  Die  jenseitigen \r\nDeutsclien  rupfen  den  Teig  wieder  auseinander  und  braten \r\nihn  in  Butter  auf;  der  welsche  Tiroler  hingegen  ißt  ihn  so \r\nweg,  manchmal  Käse  daraufgerieben,  und  das  ganze  Jahr \r\nkein  Fleisch.  Notwendig  muß  das  die  ersten  Wege  ver- \r\nleimen und  verstopfen,  besonders  bei  den  Kindern  und \r\nFrauen,  und  die  kachektische  Farbe  deutet  auf  solches \r\nVerderben.  Außerdem  essen  sie  auch  noch  Früchte  und \r\ngrüne  Bohnen,  die  sie  in  Wasser  absieden  und  mit  Knob- \r\nlauch und  Öl  anmachen.  Ich  fragte,  ob  es  nicht  auch \r\nreiche  Bauern  gäbe. — Ja  freilich. — Tun  sie  sich  nichts \r\nzugute?  essen  sie  nicht  besser? — Nein,  sie  sind  es  einmal \r\nso  gewohnt. — Wo  kommen  sie  denn  mit  ihrem  Gelde  hin? \r\nwas  machen  sie  sonst  für  Aufwand? — O,  die  haben  schon \r\nihre  Herren,  die  es  ihnen  wieder  abnehmen. — Das  war  die \r\nSumma  des  Gesprächs  mit  meiner  Wirtstochter  in  Bozen. \r\nFerner  vernahm  ich  von  ihr,  daß  die  Weinbauern,  die \r\nam  wohlhabendsten  scheinen,  sich  am  übelsten  befinden; \r\ndenn  sie  sind  in  den  Händen  der  städtischen  Handels- \r\nleute, die  ihnen  bei  schlechten  Jahren  den  Lebensunter- \r\nhalt vorschießen  und  bei  guten  den  Wein  um  ein  geringes \r\nan  sich  nehmen.  Doch  das  ist  überall  dasselbe. \r\nWas  meine  Meinung  wegen  der  Nahrung  bestätigt,  ist, \r\ndaß  die  Stadtbewohnerinnen  immer  wohler  aussehen. \r\nHübsche,  volle  Mädchengesichter,  der  Körper  für  ihre \r\nStärke  und  für  die  Größe  der  Köpfe  etwas  zu  klein,  mit- \r\nunter aber  recht  freundlich  entgegenkommende  Gesichter. \r\nDie  Männer  kennen  wir  durch  die  wandernden  Tiroler. \r\nIm  Lande  sehen  sie  weniger  frisch  aus  als  die  Weiber, \r\nwahrscheinlich  weil  diese  mehr  körperliche  Arbeiten, \r\nmehr  l>ewegung  haben,  die  Männer  hingegen  als  Krämer \r\nund  Handwerksleute  sitzen.  Am  Gardasee  fand  ich  die \r\nLeute  sehr  braun  und  ohne  den  mindesten  rötlichen \r\nSchein  der  Wangen,  aber  doch  nicht  ungesund,  sondern \r\nganz  frisch  und  behaglich  aussehend.  Wahrscheinlich \r\nsind  die  heftigen  Sonnenstrahlen,  denen  sie  am  Fuße \r\nihrer  Felsen  ausgesetzt  sind,  hievon  die  Ursache. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  43 \r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG. \r\n\r\nVerona,  den  16.  September  1786. \r\n\r\nDAS  Amphitheater  ist  also  das  erste  bedeutende  Monu- \r\nment der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  sehe,  tmd  so  gut  erhalten! \r\nAls  ich  hinein  trat,  mehr  noch  aber,  als  ich  oben  auf  dem \r\nRande  umher  ging,  schien  es  mir  seltsam,  etwas  Großes \r\nund  doch  eigentlich  nichts  zu  sehen.  Auch  will  es  leer \r\nnicht  gesehen  sein,  sondern  ganz  voll  von  Menschen,  wie \r\nman  es  neuerer  Zeit  Joseph  dem  Zweiten  und  Pius  dem \r\nSechsten  zu  Ehren  veranstaltet.  Der  Kaiser,  der  doch \r\nauch  Menschenmassen  vor  Augen  gewohnt  war,  soll  dar- \r\nüber erstaunt  sein.  Doch  nur  in  der  frühesten  Zeit  tat \r\nes  seine  ganze  Wirkung,  da  das  Volk  noch  mehr  Volk \r\nwar,  als  es  jetzt  ist.  Denn  eigentlich  ist  so  ein  Amphi- \r\ntheater recht  gemacht,  dem  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zu  impo- \r\nnieren, das  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zum  besten  zu  haben. \r\nWenn  irgend  etwas  Schauwürdiges  auf  flacher  Erde  vor- \r\ngeht und  alles  zuläuft,  suchen  die  Hintersten  auf  alle \r\nmögliche  Weise  sich  über  die  Vordersten  zu  erheben:  man \r\ntritt  auf  Bänke,  rollt  Fässer  herbei,  fährt  mit  Wagen \r\nheran,  legt  Bretter  hinüber  und  herüber,  besetzt  einen \r\nbenachbarten  Hügel,  und  es  bildet  sich  in  der  Geschwin- \r\ndigkeit ein  Krater. \r\n\r\nKommt  das  Schauspiel  öfter  auf  derselben  Stelle  vor,  so \r\nbaut  man  leichte  Gerüste  für  die,  so  bezahlen  können, \r\nund  die  übrige  Masse  behilft  sich,  wie  sie  mag.  Dieses \r\nallgemeine  Bedürfnis  zu  befriedigen,  ist  hier  die  Aufgabe \r\ndes  Architekten.  Er  bereitet  einen  solchen  Krater  durch \r\nKunst,  so  einfach  als  nur  möglich,  damit  dessen  Zierat \r\ndas  Volk  selbst  werde.  Wenn  es  sich  so  beisammen  sah, \r\nmußte  es  über  sich  selbst  erstaunen;  denn  da  es  sonst \r\nnur  gewohnt,  sich  durcheinander  laufen  zu  sehen,  sich  in \r\neinem  Gewühle  ohne  Ordnung  und  sonderliche  Zucht  zu \r\nfinden,  so  sieht  das  vielköpfige,  vielsinnige,  schwankende, \r\nhin  und  her  irrende  Tier  sich  zu  einem  edlen  Körper \r\nvereinigt,  zu  einer  Einheit  bestimmt,  in  eine  Masse \r\nverbunden  und  befestigt,  als  eine  Gestalt,  von  eijiem \r\nGeiste  belebt.    Die  Simplizität  des  Oval  ist  jedem  Auge \r\n\r\n\r\n44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nauf  die  angenehmste  Weise  fühlbar,  und  jeder  Kopf  dient \r\nzum  Maße,  wie  ungeheuer  das  Ganze  sei.  Jetzt,  wenn \r\nman  es  leer  sieht,  hat  man  keinen  Maßstab,  man  weiß \r\nnicht,  ob  es  groß  oder  klein  ist. \r\n\r\nWegen  der  Unterhaltung  dieses  Werks  müssen  die  Vero- \r\nneser  gelobt  werden.  Es  ist  von  einem  rötlichen  Marmor \r\ngebaut,  den  die  Witterung  angreift;  daher  stellt  man  der \r\nReihe  nach  die  ausgefressenen  Stufen  immer  wieder  her, \r\nund  sie  scheinen  fast  alle  ganz  neu.  Eine  Inschrift  ge- \r\ndenkt eines  Hieronymus  Maurigenus  und  seines  auf  dieses \r\nMonument  verwendeten  unglaublichen  Fleißes.  Von  der \r\näußern  Mauer  steht  nur  ein  Stück,  und  ich  zweifele,  ob \r\nsie  je  ganz  fertig  geworden.  Die  untern  Gewölbe,  die  an \r\nden  großen  Platz,  II  Brä  genannt,  stoßen,  sind  an  Hand- \r\nwerker vermietet,  und  es  sieht  lustig  genug  aus,  diese \r\nHöhlungen  wieder  belebt  zu  sehen. \r\n\r\nDas  schönste,  aber  immer  geschlossene  Tor  heißt  Porta \r\nstuppa  oder  del  Pallio.  Als  Tor  und  in  der  großen  Ent- \r\nfernung, aus  der  man  es  schon  gewahr  wird,  ist  es  nicht \r\ngut  gedacht;  denn  erst  in  der  Nähe  erkennt  man  das \r\nVerdienst  des  Gebäudes. \r\n\r\nSie  geben  allerlei  Ursachen  an,  warum  es  geschlossen \r\nsei.  Ich  habe  jedoch  eine  Mutmaßung.  Die  Absicht  des \r\nKünstlers  ging  offenbar  dahin,  durch  dieses  Tor  eine  neue \r\nAnlage  des  Korso  zu  verursachen;  denn  auf  die  jetzige \r\nStraße  steht  es  ganz  falsch.  Die  linke  Seite  hat  lauter \r\nBaracken,  und  die  winkelrechte  Linie  der  Mitte  des  Tores \r\ngeht  auf  ein  Nonnenkloster  zu,  das  notwendig  hätte \r\nniedergelegt  werden  müssen.  Das  sah  man  wohl  ein,  auch \r\nmochten  die  Vornehmen  und  Reichen  nicht  Lust  haben, \r\nsich  in  dem  entfernten  Quartier  anzubauen.  Der  Künstler \r\nstarb  vielleicht,  und  so  schloß  man  das  Tor,  wodurch  die \r\nSache  nun  auf  einmal  geendigt  war. \r\n\r\nDas  Portal  des  Theatergebäudes,  von  sechs  großen  ioni- \r\nschen Säulen,  nimmt  sich  anständig  genug  aus.  Desto \r\nkleinlicher  erscheint  über  der  Türe,  vor  einer  gemalten \r\nNische,  die  von  zwei  korintliischen  Säulen  getragen  wird \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  45 \r\n\r\ndie  lebensgroße  Büste  des  Marchese  Maffei  in  einer \r\ngroßen  Perücke.  Der  Platz  ist  ehrenvoll,  aber  um  sich \r\ngegen  die  Größe  und  Tüchtigkeit  der  Säulen  einiger- \r\nmaßen zu  halten,  hätte  die  Büste  kolossal  sein  müssen. \r\nJetzt  steht  sie  kleinlich  auf  einem  Kragsteinchen,  unhar- \r\nmonisch mit  dem  Ganzen. \r\n\r\nAuch  die  Galerie,  die  den  Vorhof  einfaßt,  ist  kleinlich, \r\nund  die  kannelierten  dorischen  Zwerge  nehmen  sich  neben \r\nden  glatten  ionischen  Riesen  armselig  aus.  Doch  wollen \r\nwir  das  verzeihen  in  Betracht  der  schönen  Anstalt,  welche \r\nunter  diesen  Säulenlauben  angelegt  ist.  Hier  hat  man \r\ndie  Antiquitäten,  meist  in  und  um  Verona  gegraben,  ge- \r\nsammelt aufgestellt.  Einiges  soll  sogar  sich  im  Amphi- \r\ntheater gefunden  haben.  Es  sind  etrurische,  griechische, \r\nrömische,  bis  zu  den  niedern  Zeiten  und  auch  neuere. \r\nDie  Basreliefs  sind  in  die  Wände  eingemauert  und  mit \r\nden  Nummern  versehen,  die  ihnen  Maffei  gab,  als  er  sie \r\nin  seinem  Werke  Verona  illustrata  beschrieb.  Altäre, \r\nStücke  von  Säulen  und  dergleichen  Reste.  Ein  ganz  treff- \r\nlicher Dreifuß  von  weißem  Marmor,  worauf  Genien,  die \r\nsich  mit  den  Attributen  der  Götter  beschäftigen.  Raffael \r\nhat  dergleichen  in  den  Zwickeln  der  Farnesine  nachge- \r\nahmt und  verklärt. \r\n\r\nDer  Wind,  der  von  den  Gräbern  der  Alten  herweht, \r\nkommt  mit  Wohlgerüchen  wie  über  einen  Rosenhügel. \r\nDie  Grabmäler  sind  herzlich  und  rührend  und  stellen \r\nimmer  das  Leben  her.  Da  ist  ein  Mann,  der  neben  seiner \r\nFrau  aus  einer  Nische  wie  zu  einem  Fenster  heraussieht. \r\nDa  stehen  Vater  und  Mutter,  den  Sohn  in  der  Mitte,  ein- \r\nander mit  unaussprechlicher  Natürlichkeit  anblickend. \r\nHier  reicht  sich  ein  Paar  die  Hände.  Hier  scheint  ein \r\nVater,  auf  seinem  Sofa  ruhend,  von  der  Familie  unter- \r\nhalten zu  werden.  Mir  war  die  unmittelbare  Gegenwart \r\ndieser  Steine  höchst  rührend.  Von  späterer  Kunst  sind \r\nsie,  aber  einfach,  natürlich  und  allgemein  ansprechend. \r\nHier  ist  kein  geharnischter  Mann  auf  den  Knien,  der \r\neine  fröhliche  Auferstehung  erwartet.  Der  Künstler  hat \r\nmit  mehr  oder  weniger  Geschick  nur  die  einfache  Gegen- \r\nwart  der   Menschen  hingestellt,   ihre  Existenz  dadurch \r\n\r\n\r\n46  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nfortgesetzt  und  bleibend  gemacht.  Sie  falten  nicht  die \r\nHände,  schauen  nicht  gen  Himmel,  sondern  sie  sind  hie- \r\nnieden,  was  sie  waren  und  was  sie  sind.  Sie  stehen  bei- \r\nsammen, nehmen  Anteil  aneinander,  lieben  sich;  und  das \r\nist  in  den  Steinen,  sogar  mit  einer  gewissen  Handwerks- \r\nunfähigkeit, allerliebst  ausgedrückt.  Ein  sehr  reich  ver- \r\nzierter marmorner  Pfeiler  gab  mir  auch  neue  Begriffe. \r\nSo  löblich  diese  Anstalt  ist,  so  sieht  man  ihr  doch  an, \r\ndaß  der  edle  Erhaltungsgeist,  der  sie  gegründet,  nicht \r\nmehr  in  ihr  fortlebt.  Der  kostbare  Dreifuß  geht  nächstens \r\nzugrunde,  weil  er  frei  steht,  gegen  Westen  der  Witterung \r\nausgesetzt.  Mit  einem  hölzernen  Futteral  wäre  dieser \r\nSchatz  leicht  zu  erhalten. \r\n\r\nDer  angefangene  Palast  des  Proveditore,  wäre  er  fertig \r\ngeworden,  hätte  ein  schön  Stück  Baukunst  gegeben.  Sonst \r\nbauen  die  Nobili  noch  viel,  leider  aber  ein  jeder  auf  den \r\nPlatz,  wo  seine  ältere  Wohnung  stand,  also  oft  in  engen \r\nGassen.  So  baut  man  jetzt  eine  prächtige  Fassade  eines \r\nSeminariums  in  einem  Gäßchen  der  entferntesten  Vor- \r\nstadt. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  mit  meinem  zufällig  aufgegriffenen  Begleiter  vor \r\neinem  großen  ernsthaften  Tore  eines  wunderbaren  Ge- \r\nbäudes vorüberging,  fragte  er  mich  gutmütig,  ob  ich  nicht \r\neinen  Augenblick  in  den  Hof  treten  wolle.  Es  war  der \r\nPalast  der  Justiz,  und  wegen  Höhe  der  Gebäude  erschien \r\nder  Hof  doch  nur  als  ein  ungeheurer  Brunnen.  Hier \r\nwerden,  sagte  er,  alle  die  Verbrecher  und  Verdächtigen \r\nverwahrt.  Ich  sah  umher,  und  durch  alle  Stockwerke \r\ngingen,  an  zahlreichen  Türen  hin,  offene  mit  eisernen \r\nGeländern  versehene  Gänge.  Der  Gefangene,  wie  er  aus \r\nseinem  Kerker  heraustrat,  um  zum  Verhör  geführt  zu \r\nwerden,  stand  in  der  freien  Tuft,  war  aber  auch  den \r\nBlicken  aller  ausgesetzt;  und  weil  nun  mehrere  Verhör- \r\nstuben sein  mochten,  so  klapperten  die  Ketten  bald  über \r\ndiesem,  bald  über  jenem  Gange  durch  alle  Stockwerke. \r\nEs  war  ein  verwünschter  Anblick,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \r\ndaß  der  gute  Humor,  womit  ich  meine  Vögel  abgefertigt \r\nhatte,  hier  doch  einen  etwas  schweren  Stand  würde  ge- \r\nfunden haben. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  47 \r\n\r\nIch  ging  auf  der  Kante  des  amphitheatralischen  Kraters \r\nbei  Sonnenuntergang,  der  schönsten  Aussicht  genießend \r\nüber  Stadt  und  Gegend.  Ich  war  ganz  allein,  und  unten \r\nauf  den  breiten  Steinen  des  Brä  gingen  Mengen  von \r\nMenschen,  Männer  von  allen  Ständen,  Weiber  vomMittel- \r\nstande  spazieren.  Diese  letztern  nehmen  sich  in  ihren \r\nschwarzen  Überkleidern,  aus  dieser  Vogelperspektive,  gar \r\nmumienhaft  aus. \r\n\r\nDer  Zendale  und  die  Veste,  die  dieser  Klasse  statt  aller \r\nGarderobe  dient,  ist  übrigens  eine  Tracht,  ganz  einge- \r\nrichtet für  ein  Volk,  das  nicht  immer  für  Reinlichkeit \r\nsorgen  und  doch  immer  ööentlich  erscheinen,  bald  in  der \r\nKirche,  bald  auf  dem  Spaziergange  sein  will.  Veste  ist \r\nein  schwarztaffeter  Rock,  der  über  andere  Röcke  gewor- \r\nfen wird.  Hat  das  Frauenzimmer  einen  reinlichen  weißen \r\ndarunter,  so  versteht  sie  den  schwarzen  an  der  einen  Seite \r\nin  die  Höhe  zu  heben.  Dieser  wird  so  angegürtet,  daß \r\ner  die  Taille  abschneidet  und  die  Lippen  des  Korsetts \r\nbedeckt,  welches  von  jeglicher  Farbe  sein  kann.  Der \r\nZendale  ist  eine  große  Kappe,  mit  langen  Barten,  die \r\nKappe  selbst  durch  ein  Drahtgestell  hoch  über  den  Kopf \r\ngehalten,  die  Barte  aber  wie  eine  Schärpe  um  den  Leib \r\ngeknüpft,  so  daß  die  Enden  hinterwärts  herunterfallen. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  heute  wieder  von  der  Arena  wegging,  kam  ich \r\neinige  tausend  Schritte  davon  zu  einem  modernen  ößent- \r\nlichen  Schauspiel.  Vier  edle  Veroneser  schlugen  Ball \r\ngegen  vier  Vicentiner.  Sie  treiben  dies  sonst  unter  sich \r\ndas  ganze  Jahr,  etwa  zwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht;  diesmal, \r\nwegen  der  fremden  Gegner,  lief  das  Volk  unglaublich  zu. \r\nEs  können  immer  vier-  bis  fünftausend  Zuschauer  ge- \r\nwesen sein.  Frauen  sah  ich  von  keinem  Stande. \r\nVorhin,  als  ich  vom  Bedürfnis  der  Menge  in  einem  sol- \r\nchen Falle  sprach,  hab'  ich  das  natürliche  zufällige  Am- \r\nphitaeater  schon  beschrieben,  wie  ich  das  Volk  hier  über- \r\neinander gebaut  sah.  Ein  lebhaftes  Händeklatschen  hört' \r\nich  schon  von  weiten,  jeder  bedeutende  Schlag  war  da- \r\nvon begleitet.  Das  Spiel  aber  geht  so  vor  sich:  In  ge- \r\nhöriger Entfernung  voneinander   sind   zwei   gelind  ab- \r\n\r\n\r\n4  3  ITA  1  JENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nliängige  Bretterflächen  errichtet.  Derjenige,  der  den  Ball \r\nausschlägt,  steht,  die  Rechte  mit  einem  hölzernen  breiten \r\nStachelringe  bewaffnet,  auf  der  obersten  Höhe.  Ir^dem \r\nnun  ein  anderer  von  seiner  Partei  ihm  den  r>all  zuwirft, \r\nso  läuft  er  herunter  dem  Ball  entgegen  und  vermehrt  da- \r\ndurch die  Gewalt  des  Schlages,  womit  er  denselben  zu \r\ntreffen  weiß.  Die  Gegner  suchen  ihn  zurückzuschlagen, \r\nund  so  geht  es  hin  und  wieder,  bis  er  zuletzt  im  Felde \r\nliegen  bleibt.  Die  schönsten  Stellungen,  wert,  in  Marmor \r\nnachgebildet  zu  werden,  kommen  dabei  zum  Vorschein. \r\nDa  es  lauter  wohlgewachsene,  rüstige,  junge  Leute  sind, \r\nin  kurzer,  knapper,  weißer  Kleidung,  so  unterscheiden \r\nsich  die  Parteien  nur  durch  ein  farbiges  Abzeichen.  Be- \r\nsonders schön  ist  die  Stellung,  in  welche  der  Ausschlagende \r\ngerät,  indem  er  von  der  schiefen  Fläche  herunter  läuft \r\nund  den  Ball  zu  treffen  ausholt;  sie  nähert  sich  der  des \r\nBorghesischen  Fechters. \r\n\r\nSonderbar  kam  es  mir  vor,  daß  sie  diese  Übung  an  einer \r\nnlten  Stadtmauer,  ohne  die  mindeste  Bequemlichkeit  für \r\ndie  Zuschauer,  vornehmen;  warum  sie  es  nicht  im  Amphi- \r\ntheater tun,  wo  so  schöner  Raum  wäre! \r\n\r\nDen  //.  September. \r\nWas  ich  von  Gemälden  gesehen,  will  ich  nur  kurz  be- \r\nrühren und  einige  Betrachtungen  hinzufügen.  Ich  mache \r\ndiese  wunderbare  Reise  nicht,  um  micli  selbst  zu  be- \r\ntrügen, sondern  um  mich  an  den  Gegenständen  kennen \r\nzu  lernen;  da  sage  ich  mir  denn  ganz  aufrichtig,  daß  ich \r\nvon  der  Kunst,  von  dem  Handwerk  des  Malers  wenig \r\nverstehe.  Meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  meine  Betrachtung \r\nkann  nur  auf  den  jiraktischen  Teil,  auf  den  Gegenstand \r\nund  auf  die  Behandlung  desselben  im  allgemeinen  ge- \r\nrichtet sein. \r\n\r\nSan  Giorgio  ist  eine  Galerie  von  guten  Gemälden,  alle \r\nAltarblätter,  wo  nicht  von  gleichem  Wert,  doch  duich- \r\naus  merkwürdig.  Aber  die  unglückseigen  Künstler,  was \r\nmußten  die  malen!  und  für  wen!  Ein  Mannaregen,  viel- \r\nleicht dreißig  Fuß  lang  und  zwanzig  hoch!  das  Wunder \r\nder  fünf  Brote  zum  Gegenstück!  was  war  daran  zu  malen: \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  49 \r\n\r\nHungrige  Menschen,  die  über  kleine  Körner  herfallen, \r\nunzählige  andere,  denen  Brot  präsentiert  wird.  Die \r\nKünstler  haben  sich  die  Folter  gegeben,  um  solche  Arm- \r\nseligkeiten bedeutend  zu  machen.  Und  doch  hat,  durch \r\ndiese  Nötigung  gereizt,  das  Genie  schöne  Sachen  hervor- \r\ngebracht. Ein  Künstler,  der  die  heilige  Ursula  mit  den \r\neilftausend  Jungfrauen  vorzustellen  hatte,  zog  sich  mit \r\ngroßem  Verstand  aus  der  Sache.  Die  Heilige  steht  im \r\nVordergrunde,  als  habe  sie  siegend  das  Land  in  Besitz \r\ngenommen;  sie  ist  sehr  edel,  amazonenhaft-jungfräulich, \r\nohne  Reiz  gebildet;  in  der  alles  verkleinernden  Ferne \r\nhingegen  sieht  man  ihre  Schar  aus  den  Schiften  steigen \r\nund  ia  Prozession  herankommen.  Die  Himmelfahrt  Maria \r\nim  Dom,  von  Tizian,  ist  sehr  verschwärzt,  der  Gedanke \r\nlobenswert,  daß  die  angehende  Göttin  nicht  himmel- \r\nwärts, sondern  herab  nach  ihren  Freunden  blickt. \r\nIn  der  Galerie  Gherardini  fand  ich  sehr  schöne  Sachen \r\nvon  Orbetto  und  lernte  diesen  verdienten  Künstler  auf \r\neinmal  kennen.  In  der  Entfernung  erfährt  man  nur  von \r\nden  ersten  Künstlern,  und  oft  begnügt  man  sich  mit  ihren \r\nNamen;  wenn  man  aber  diesem  Sternenhimmel  näher \r\ntritt  und  die  von  der  zweiten  und  dritten  Größe  nun  auch \r\nzu  flimmern  anfangen  und  jeder  auch  als  zum  ganzen \r\nSternbild  gehörend  hervortritt,  dann  wird  die  Welt  weit \r\nund  die  Kunst  reich.  Den  Gedanken  eines  Bildes  muß \r\nich  hier  loben.  Nur  zwei  Halbfiguren.  Simson  ist  eben \r\nim  Schöße  der  Delila  eingeschlafen,  sie  greift  leise  über \r\nihn  hinweg  nach  einer  Schere,  die  auf  dem  Tisch  neben \r\nder  Lampe  liegt.  Die  Ausfülirung  ist  sehr  brav.  Im \r\nPalast  Canossa  war  mir  eine  Danae  bemerklich. \r\nDer  Palast  Bevilacqua  enthält  die  köstlichsten  Sachen. \r\nEin  sogenanntes  Paradies  von  Tintorett,  eigentlich  aber \r\ndie  Krönung  der  Maria  zur  Himmelskönigin  in  Gegen- \r\nwart aller  Erzväter,  Propheten,  Apostel,  Heiligen,  Engel \r\nusw.,  eine  Gelegenheit,  den  ganzen  Reichtum  des  glück- \r\nlichsten Genies  zu  entwickeln.  Leichtigkeit  des  Pinsels, \r\nGeist,  Mannigfaltigkeit  des  Ausdrucks,  dies  alles  zu  be- \r\nwundern und  sich  dessen  zu  erfreuen,  müßte  man  das \r\nStück  selbst  besitzen  und  es  zeitlebens  vor  Augen  haben. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  4 \r\n\r\n\r\n50  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDie  Arbeit  geht  ins  Unendliche,  ja  die  letzten  in  der \r\nGlorie  verschwindenden  Engelsköpfe  haben  noch  Cha- \r\nrakter. Die  größten  Figuren  mögen  einen  Fuß  hoch  sein, \r\nMaria  und  Christus,  der  ihr  die  Krone  aufsetzt,  etwa \r\nvier  Zoll.  Die  Eva  ist  doch  das  schönste  Weibchen  auf \r\ndem  Bilde  und  noch  immer  von  alters  her  ein  wenig \r\nlüstern. \r\n\r\nEin  paar  Porträte  von  Paul  Veronese  haben  meine  Hoch- \r\nachtung für  diesen  Künstler  nur  vermehrt.  Die  Antiken- \r\nsammlung ist  herrlich,  ein  hingestreckter  Sohn  der  Niobe \r\nköstlich,  die  Büsten,  ungeachtet  ihrer  restaurierten  Nasen, \r\nmeistens  höchst  interessant,  ein  August  mit  der  Bürger- \r\nkrone, ein  Caligula  und  andere. \r\n\r\nJ'ls  liegt  in  meiner  Natur,  das  Große  und  Schöne  willig \r\nund  mit  Freuden  zu  verehren,  und  diese  Anlage  an  so \r\nlaerrlichen  Gegenständen  Tag  für  Tag,  Stunde  für  Stunde \r\nauszubilden,  ist  das  seligste  aller  Gefühle. \r\nIn  einem  Lande,  wo  man  des  Tages  genießt,  besonders \r\naber  des  Abends  sich  erfreut,  ist  es  höchst  bedeutend, \r\nwenn  die  Nacht  einbricht.  Dann  hört  die  Arbeit  auf, \r\ndann  kehrt  der  Spaziergänger  zurück,  der  Vater  will  seine \r\nTochter  wieder  zu  Hause  sehen,  der  Tag  hat  ein  Ende; \r\ndoch  was  Tag  sei,  wissen  wir  Cimmerier  kaum.  In  ewi- \r\ngem Nebel  und  Trübe  ist  es  uns  einerlei,  ob  es  Tag  oder \r\nNacht  ist;  denn  wie  viel  Zeit  können  wir  uns  unter  freiem \r\nHimmel  wahrhaft  ergehen  und  ergötzen:  Wie  hier  die \r\nNacht  eintritt,  ist  der  Tag  entschieden  vorbei,  der  aus \r\nAbend  und  Morgen  bestand;  vierundzwanzig  Stunden  sind \r\nverlebt,  eine  neue  Rechnung  geht  an,  die  Glocken  läuten, \r\nder  Rosenkranz  wird  gebetet,  mit  brennender  Lampe  tritt \r\ndie  Magd  in  das  Zimmer  und  spricht:  Felicissima  nottc! \r\nDiese  Epoche  verändert  sich  mit  jeder  Jahreszeit,  und  der \r\nMensch,  der  hier  lebendig  lebt,  kann  nicht  irre  werden, \r\nweil  jeder  Genuß  seines  Daseins  sich  nicht  auf  die  Stunde, \r\nsondern  auf  die  Tageszeit  bezieht.  Zwänge  man  dem \r\nVolke  einen  deutschen  Zeiger  auf,  so  würde  man  es  ver- \r\nwirrt machen,  denn  der  seinige  ist  innigst  mit  seiner \r\nNatur  verwebt.  Anderthalb  Stunden,  eine  Stunde  vor \r\nNacht  fängt  der  Adel  an,  au.szufahren;   es  geht  auf  den \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  51 \r\n\r\nBrä,  die  lange  breite  Straße  nach  der  Porta  nuova  zu,  das \r\nTor  hinaus,  an  der  Stadt  hin,  und  wie  es  Nacht  schlägt, \r\nkehrt  alles  um.  Teils  fahren  sie  an  die  Kirchen,  das \r\nAve  Maria  della  sera  zu  beten,  teils  halten  sie  auf  dem \r\nBrä;  die  Kavaliers  treten  an  die  Kutschen,  unterhalten \r\nsich  mit  den  Damen,  und  das  dauert  eine  Weile,  ich  habe \r\ndas  Ende  niemals  abgewartet;  die  Fußgänger  bleiben \r\nweit  in  die  Nacht.  Heute  war  gerade  so  viel  Regen  nie- \r\ndergegangen, um  den  Staub  zu  löschen;  es  war  wirklich \r\nein  lebendiger,  munterer  Anblick. \r\n\r\nUm  mich  ferner  in  einem  wichtigen  Punkte  der  Landes- \r\ngewohnheit gleichzustellen,  habe  ich  mir  ein  Hilfsmittel \r\nerdacht,  wie  ich  ihre  Stundenrechnung  mir  leichter  zu \r\neigen  machte.  Nachfolgendes  Bild  kann  davon  einen  Be- \r\ngriff geben.  Der  innere  Kreis  bedeutet  unsere  vierund- \r\nzwanzig Stunden,  von  Mitternacht  zu  Mitternacht,  in \r\nzweimal  zwölf  geteilt,  wie  wir  zählen  und  unsere  Uhren \r\nsie  zeigen.  Der  mittlere  Kreis  deutet  an,  wie  die  Glocken \r\nin  der  jetzigen  Jahreszeit  hier  schlagen,  nämlich  gleich- \r\nfalls zweimal  bis  zwölf  in  vierundzwanzig  Stunden,  allein \r\ndergestalt,  daß  es  eins  schlägt,  wenn  es  bei  uns  acht \r\nschlüge,  und  so  fort,  bis  zwölfe  voll  sind.  Morgens  acht \r\nUhr  nach  unserm  Zeiger  schlägt  es  wieder  eins  usw.  Der \r\noberste  Kreis  zeigt  nun  endlich,  wie  bis  vierundzwanzig \r\nim  Leben  gezählt  wird.  Ich  höre  z.  B.  in  der  Nacht  sie- \r\nben schlagen  und  weiß,  daß  Mitternacht  um  fünf  ist,  so \r\nziehe  ich  diese  Zahl  von  jener  ab  und  habe  also  zwei \r\nUhr  Nachmitternacht.  Hör  ich  am  Tage  sieben  schlagen \r\nund  weiß,  daß  auch  Mittag  um  fünf  Uhr  ist,  so  verfahre \r\nich  ebenso  und  habe  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag.  Will  ich \r\naber  die  Stunden  nach  hiesiger  Weise  aussprechen,  so \r\nmuß  ich  wissen,  daß  Mittag  siebenzehn  Uhr  ist;  hiezu \r\nfüge  ich  noch  die  zwei  und  sage  neunzehn  Uhr.  Wenn \r\nman  dies  zum  erstenmal  hört  und  überdenkt,  so  scheint \r\nes  höchst  verworren  und  schwer  durchzuführen;  man  wird \r\nes  aber  gar  bald  gewohnt  und  findet  diese  Beschäftigung \r\nunterhaltend,  wie  sich  auch  das  Volk  an  dem  ewigen \r\nHin-  und  Widerrechnen  ergötzt,  wie  Kinder  an  leicht  zu \r\nüberwindenden    Schwierig-keiten.     Sie    haben    ohnedies \r\n\r\n\r\n52  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nimmer  die  Finger  in  der  Luft,  rechnen  alles  im  Kopfe \r\nund  machen  sich  gern  mit  Zahlen  zu  schaffen.  Ferner  ist \r\ndem  Inländer  die  Sache  so  viel  leichter,  weil  er  sich  um \r\nMittag  und  Mitternacht  eigentlich  nicht  bekümmert  und \r\nnicht,  wie  der  Fremde  in  diesem  Lande  tut,  zwei  Zeiger \r\nmiteinander  vergleicht.  Sie  zählen  nur  von  Abend  die \r\nStunden,  wie  sie  schlagen;  am  Tag  addieren  sie  die  Zahl \r\nzu  der  ihnen  bekannten  abwechselnden  Mittagszahl.  Das \r\nweitere  erläutern  die  der  Figur  beigefügten  Anmerkun- \r\ngen. (Siehe  das  nebenstehende  Blatt.) \r\nDas  Volk  rührt  sich  hier  sehr  lebhaft  durcheinander;  be- \r\nsonders in  einigen  Straßen,  wo  Kaufläden  und  Hand- \r\nwerksbuden aneinander  stoßen,  sieht  es  recht  lustig  aus. \r\nDa  ist  nicht  etwa  eine  Tür  vor  dem  Laden  oder  Arbeits- \r\nzimmer, nein,  die  ganze  Breite  des  Hauses  ist  often, \r\nman  sieht  bis  in  die  Tiefe  und  alles,  was  darin  vorgeht. \r\nDie  Schneider  nähen,  die  Schuster  ziehen  und  pochen \r\nalle  halb  auf  der  Gasse;  ja  die  Werkstätten  machen  einen \r\nTeil  der  Straße.  Abends,  wenn  Lichter  brennen,  sieht  es \r\nrecht  lebendig. \r\n\r\nAuf  den  Plätzen  ist  es  an  Markttagen  sehr  voll.  Gemüse \r\nund  Früchte  unübersehlich,  Knoblauch  und  Zwiebeln \r\nnach  Herzenslust.  Übrigens  schreien,  schäkern  und  singen \r\nsie  den  ganzen  Tag,  werfen  und  balgen  sich,  jauchzen \r\nund  lachen  unaufhörlich.  Die  milde  Luft,  die  wohlfeile \r\nNahrung  läßt  sie  leicht  leben.  Alles,  was  nur  kann,  ist \r\nunter  freiem  Himmel. \r\n\r\nNachts  geht  nun  das  Singen  und  Lärmen  recht  an.  Das \r\nLiedchen  von  Marlborough  hört  man  auf  allen  Straßen, \r\ndann  ein  Hackebrett,  eine  Violine.  Sie  üben  sich,  alle \r\nVögel  mit  Pfeifen  nachzumachen.  Die  wunderlichsten \r\nTöne  brechen  überall  hervor.  Ein  solches  Übergefühl  des \r\nDaseins  verleiht  ein  mildes  Klima  auch  der  Armut,  und \r\nder  Schatten  des  Volks  scheint  selbst  noch  ehrwürdig. \r\nDie  uns  so  sehr  auffallende  Unreinlichkeit  und  wenige \r\nBe(iuemlichkeit  der  Häuser  entspringt  auch  daher:  sie \r\nsind  immer  draußen,  und  in  ihrer  Sorglosigkeit  denken \r\nsie  an  nichts.  Dem  Volk  ist  alles  recht  und  gut;  der \r\nMittelmann  lebt  auch  von  einem  Tag  zum  andern;   der \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  53 \r\n\r\nVergleichlingskreis \r\n\r\nder  italienischen  und  deutschen  Uhr,  auch  der  italienischen \r\nZeiger  für  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  Septembers. \r\n\r\nM  i  1 1  a  ?. \r\n\r\n\r\nMitternacht. \r\n\r\nDi2  Nacht  wächst  mit  jedem  halben  Monat  eine  halbe  Stunde. \r\n\r\nMonat.

Ihre \r\nGesellschaften  halten  sie  in  öfifentlichen  Versammlungs- \r\nhiiusern.  Vorhöfe  und  Säulengänge  sind  alle  mit  Unrat \r\nbesudelt,  und  es  geht  ganz  natürlich  zu.  Das  Volk  fühlt \r\nsich  immer  vor.  Der  Reiche  kann  reich  sein,  Paläste \r\nbauen,  der  Nobile  darf  regieren,  aber  wenn  er  einen \r\nSäulengang,  einen  Vorhof  anlegt,  so  bedient  sich  das \r\nVolk  dessen  zu  seinem  Bedürfnis,  und  es  hat  kein  drin- \r\ngenderes, als  das  so  schnell  wie  möglich  loszuwerden, \r\nwas  es  so  häufig  als  möglich  zu  sich  genommen  hat.  Will \r\neiner  das  nicht  leiden,  so  muß  er  nicht  den  großen  Herrn \r\nspielen,  d.  h.  er  muß  nicht  tun,  als  wenn  ein  Teil  seiner \r\nWohnung  dem  Publikum  angehöre;  er  macht  seine  Türe \r\nzu,  und  so  ist  es  auch  gut.  An  öffentlichen  Gebäuden \r\nläßt  sich  das  Volk  sein  Recht  nun  gar  nicht  nehmen, \r\nund  das  ist's,  worüber  der  Fremde  durch  ganz  Italien \r\nBeschwerde  führt. \r\n\r\nIch  betrachtete  heut,  auf  mancherlei  Wegen  durch  die \r\nStadt,  die  Tracht  und  die  Manieren  besonders  des  Mittel- \r\nstandes, der  sich  sehr  häufig  und  geschäftig  zeigt.  Sie \r\nschlenkern  im  Gehen  alle  mit  den  Armen.  Personen  von \r\neinem  höhern  Stande,  die  bei  gewissen  Gelegenheiten \r\neinen  Degen  tragen,  schlenkern  nur  mit  ci/icm,  weil  sie \r\ngewohnt  sind,  den  linken  still  zu  halten. \r\nObgleich  das  Volk  seinen  Geschäften  und  Bedürfnissen \r\nsehr  sorglos  nachgeht,  so  hat  es  doch  auf  alles  Fremde \r\nein  scharfes  Auge.  So  könnt'  ich  die  ersten  Tage  be- \r\nmerken, daß  jedermann  meine  Stiefeln  betrachtete,  da \r\nman  sich  derselben  als  einer  feuern  Tracht  nicht  einmal \r\nim  Winter  bedient.  Jetzt,  da  ich  Schuh  und  Strümpfe \r\ntrage,  sieht  mich  niemand  mehr  an.  Aber  merkwürdig \r\nwar  mir's,  daß  heute  früh,  da  sie  alle  mit  Blumen,  Ge- \r\nmüse, Knoblauch  und  so  vielen  andern  Markterzeugnissen \r\ndurcheinander  liefen,  ihnen  der  Zypressenzweig  nicht  ent- \r\nging, den  ich  in  der  Hand  trug.  Einige  grüne  Zapfen \r\nhingen  daran,  und  daneben  hielt  ich  blühende  Kapem- \r\nzweige.  Sie  sahen  alle,  groß  und  klein,  mir  auf  die  Finger \r\nund  schienen  wunderliche  Gedanken  zu  haben. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  55 \r\n\r\nDiese  Zweige  bracht'  ich  aus  dem  Garten  Giusti,  der  eine \r\ntrefifliche  Lage  und  ungeheure  Zypressen  hat,  die  alle \r\npfriemenartig  in  die  Luft  stehen.  Wahrscheinlich  sind  die \r\nspitz  zugeschnittenen  Taxus  der  nordischen  Gartenkunst \r\nNachahmungen  dieses  herrlichen  Naturprodukts.  Ein \r\nBaum,  dessen  Zweige  von  unten  bis  oben,  die  ältesten \r\nwie  die  jüngsten,  gen  Himmel  streben,  der  seine  drei- \r\nhundert Jahre  dauert,  ist  wohl  der  Verehrung  wert.  Der \r\nZeit  nach,  da  der  Garten  angelegt  worden,  haben  diese \r\nschon  ein  so  hohes  Alter  erreicht. \r\n\r\nViccfiza,  den  ig.  Seftember. \r\nDer  Weg  von  Verona  hieher  ist  sehr  angenehm:  man  fährt \r\nnordostwärts  an  den  Gebirgen  hin  und  hat  die  Vorder- \r\nberge, die  aus  Sand,  Kalk,  Ton,  Mergel  bestehen,  immer \r\nlinker  Hand;  auf  den  Hügeln,  die  sie  bilden,  liegen  Orte, \r\nSchlösser,  Häuser.  Rechts  verbreitet  sich  die  weite  Fläche , \r\ndurch  die  man  fährt.  Der  gerade,  gut  unterhaltene,  breite \r\nWeg  geht  durch  fruchtbares  Feld;  man  blickt  in  tiefe  Baum- \r\nreihen, an  welchen  die  Reben  in  die  Höhe  gezogen  sind, \r\ndie  sodann,  als  wären  es  luftige  Zweige,  herunterfallen. \r\nHier  kann  man  sich  eine  Idee  von  Festonen  bilden!  Die \r\nTrauben  sind  zeitig  und  beschweren  die  Ranken,  die  lang \r\nund  schwankend  niederhängen.  Der  Weg  ist  voll  Menschen \r\naller  Art  und  Gewerbes;  besonders  freuten  mich  die  Wagen \r\nmit  niedrigen,  tellerartigen  Rädern,  die,  mit  vier  Ochsen \r\nbespannt,  große  Kufen  hin  und  wieder  führen,  in  welchen \r\ndie  Weintrauben  aus  den  Gärten  geholt  und  gestampft \r\nwerden.  Die  Führer  standen,  wenn  sie  leer  waren,  drinnen; \r\nes  sah  einem  Bacchischen  Triumphzug  ganz  ähnlich. \r\nZwischen  den  Weinreihen  ist  der  Boden  zu  allerlei  Arten \r\nGetreide,  besonders  zu  Türkischkorn  und  Sörgel  benutzt. \r\nKommt  man  gegen  Vicenza,  so  steigen  wieder  Hügel  von \r\nNorden  nach  Süden  auf — sie  sind  vulkanisch,  sagt  man \r\n— und  schließen  die  Ebene.  Vicenza  liegt  an  ihrem  Fuße \r\nund,  wenn  man  will,  in  einem  Busen,  den  sie  bilden. \r\n\r\nVor  einigen  Stunden  bin  ich  hier  angekommen,  habe  schon \r\ndie  Stadt  durchlaufen,  das  Olympische  Theater  und  die \r\n\r\n\r\n5  6  ITALTENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nGebäude  des  Palladio  gesehen.  Man  hat  ein  sehr  artiges \r\n]5üchelchen  mit  Kupfern  zur  Bequemlichkeit  der  Fremden \r\nherausgegeben,  mit  einem  kunstverständigen 'I'exte.  Wenn \r\nman  nun  diese  Werke  gegenwärtig  sieht,  so  erkennt  man \r\nerst  den  großen  Wert  derselben:  denn  sie  sollen  ja  durch \r\nilire  wirkliche  Größe  und  Körperlichkeit  das  Auge  füllen \r\nund  durch  die  schöne  Harmonie  ihrer  Dimensionen  nicht \r\nnur  in  abstrakten  Aufrissen,  sondern  mit  dem  ganzen  per- \r\nspektivischen Vordringen  und  Zurückweichen  den  Geist \r\nbefriedigen;  und  so  sag'  ich  vom  Palladio:  er  ist  ein  recht \r\ninnerlich  und  von  innen  heraus  großer  Mensch  gewesen. \r\nDie  höchste  Schwierigkeit,  mit  der  dieser  Mann,  wie  alle \r\nneuern  Architekten,  zu  kämpfen  hatte,  ist  die  schickliche \r\nAnwendung  der  Säulenordnungen  in  der  bürgerlichen  Bau- \r\nkunst: denn  Säulen  und  Mauern  zu  verbinden,  bleibt  doch \r\nimmer  ein  Widerspruch.  Aber  wie  er  das  untereinander \r\ngearbeitet  hat,  wie  er  durch  die  Gegenwart  seiner  Werke \r\nimponiert  und  vergessen  macht,  daß  er  nur  überredet!  Es \r\nist  wirklich  etwas  Göttliches  in  seinen  Anlagen,  völlig  wie \r\ndie  Force  des  großen  Dichters,  der  aus  Walu-heit  und \r\nLüge  ein  Drittes  bildet,  dessen  erborgtes  Dasein  uns  be- \r\nzaubert. \r\n\r\nDas  Olympische  Theater  ist  ein  Theater  der  Alten,  im \r\nkleinen  realisiert,  und  unaussprechlich  schön,  aber  gegen \r\ndie  unsrigen  kömmt  mir's  vor  wie  ein  vornehmes,  reiches, \r\nwohlgebildetes  Kind  gegen  einen  klugen  Wcltmenschen, \r\nder,  weder  so  vornehm  noch  so  reich,  noch  wohlgebildet, \r\nbesser  weiß,  was  er  mit  seinen  Mitteln  bewirken  kann. \r\nBeti-achtet  man  nun  hier  am  Orte  die  herrlichen  Gebäude, \r\ndie  jener  Mann  auffiihrte,  und  sieht,  wie  sie  schon  durch \r\ndas  enge  schmutzige  Bedürfnis  der  Menschen  entstellt \r\nsind,  wie  die  Anlagen  meist  über  die  Kräfte  der  Unter- \r\nnehmer Avaren,  wie  wenig  diese  köstlichen  Denkmale  eines \r\nhohen  Menschengeistes  zu  dem  Leben  der  übrigen  passen, \r\nso  fällt  einem  denn  doch  ein,  daß  es  in  allem  andern  eben- \r\nso ist:  denn  man  verdient  wenig  Dank  von  den  Menschen, \r\nwenn  man  ihr  inneres  Bedürfnis  erhöhen,  ihnen  eine  große \r\nIdee  von  ihnen  selbst  geben,  ihnen  das  Herrliche  eines \r\nwahren  edlen  Daseins  zum  Gefühl  bringen  will.     Aber \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  57 \r\n\r\nwenn  man  die  Vögel  belügt,  Märchen  erzählt,  von  Tag  zu \r\nTag  ihnen  forthelfend  sie  verschlechtert,  da  ist  man  ihr \r\nMann,  imd  darum  gefällt  sich  die  neuere  Zeit  in  so  viel \r\nAbgeschmacktem.  Ich  sage  das  nicht,  um  meine  Freunde \r\nherunterzusetzen,  ich  sage  nur,  daß  sie  so  sind  und  daß \r\nman  sich  nicht  verwundern  muß,  wenn  alles  ist,  wie \r\nes  ist. \r\n\r\nWie  sich  die  Basilika  des  Palladio  neben  einem  alten,  mit \r\nungleichen  Fenstern  übersäten,  kastellähnhchen  Gebäude \r\nausnimmt,  welches  der  Baumeister  zusamt  dem  Turm \r\ngewiß  weggedacht  hat,  ist  nicht  auszudrücken,  und  ich \r\nmuß  mich  schon  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  zusammen- \r\nfassen: denn  ich  finde  auch  hier — leider  gleich!  —  das, \r\nwas  ich  fliehe  und  suche,  nebeneinander. \r\n\r\nDen  20.  September. \r\nGestern  war  Oper,  sie  dauerte  bis  nach  Mitternacht,  und \r\nich  sehnte  mich  zu  ruhen.  \"Die  drei  Sultaninnen\"  und  \"Die \r\nEntführung  aus  dem  Serail\"  haben  manche  Fetzen  her- \r\ngegeben, woraus  das  Stück  mit  weniger  Klugheit  zu- \r\nsammengeflickt ist.  Die  Musik  hört  sich  bequem  an,  ist \r\naber  wahrscheinlich  von  einem  Liebhaber;  kein  neuer \r\nGedanke,  der  mich  getroffen  hätte.  Die  Ballette  dagegen \r\nsind  allerliebst.  Das  Hauptpaar  tanzte  eine  Allemande, \r\ndaß  man  nichts  Zierlicheres  sehen  konnte. \r\nDas  Theater  ist  neu,  lieblich,  schön,  modest-prächtig, \r\nalles  uniform,  wie  es  einer  Provinzialstadt  geziemt;  jede \r\nLoge  hat  ihren  übergeschlagenen,  gleichfarbigen  Teppich, \r\ndie  des  Capitan  Grande  ist  nur  durch  einen  etwas  längern \r\nÜberhang  ausgezeichnet. \r\n\r\nDie  erste  Sängerin,  vom  ganzen  Volke  sehr  begünstigt, \r\nwird,  wie  sie  auftritt,  entsetzlich  beklatscht,  und  die  Vögel \r\nstellen  sich  vor  Freuden  ganz  ungebärdig,  wenn  sie  etwas \r\nrecht  gut  macht,  welches  sehr  oft  geschieht.  Es  ist  ein \r\nnatürlich  Wesen,  hübsche  Figur,  schöne  Stimme,  ein  ge- \r\nfällig Gesicht  und  von  einem  recht  honetten  Anstand;  in \r\nden  Armen  könnte  sie  etwas  mehr  Grazie  haben.  In- \r\ndessen komme  ich  denn  doch  nicht  wieder;  ich  fühle,  daß \r\nich  zum  Vogel  verdorben  bin. \r\n\r\n\r\n58  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDen  21 .  September. \r\nHeute  besuchte  ich  Dr.  Turra;  wohl  fünf  Jahre  hat  er  sich \r\nmit  Leidenschaft  auf  die  Pflanzenkunde  gelegt,  ein  Herba- \r\nrium der  italienischen  Flora  gesammelt,  unter  dem  vorigen \r\nBischof  einen  botanischen  Garten  eingerichtet.  Das  ist \r\naber  alles  hin.  Medizinische  Praxis  vertrieb  die  Natur- \r\ngeschichte, das  Herbarium  wird  von  Würmern  gespeist, \r\nder  Bischof  ist  tot,  und  der  botanische  Garten  wieder, \r\nwie  billig,  mit  Kohl  und  Knoblauch  bepflanzt. \r\nDr.  Turra  ist  ein  gar  feiner  guter  Mann.  Er  erzählte  mir \r\nmit  Offenheit,  Seelenreinheit  und  Bescheidenheit  seine \r\nGeschichte  und  sprach  überhaupt  sehr  bestimmt  und  ge- \r\nfällig, hatte  aber  nicht  Lust,  seine  Schränke  aufzutun,  die \r\nvielleicht  in  keinem  präsentablen  Zustande  sein  mochten. \r\nDer  Diskurs  kam  bald  ins  Stocken. \r\n\r\nAbends. \r\nIch  ging  zum  alten  I'aumeister  Scamozzi,  der  des  Palladio \r\nGebäude  herausgegeben  hat  und  ein  wackerer,  leiden- \r\nschaftlicher Künstler  ist.  Er  gab  mir  einige  Anleitung, \r\nvergnügt  über  meine  Teilnahme.  Unter  den  Gebäuden \r\ndes  Palladio  ist  eins,  für  das  ich  immer  eine  besondere \r\nVorliebe  hatte,  es  soll  seine  eigne  Wohnung  gewesen  sein; \r\naber  in  der  Nähe  ist  es  weit  mehr,  als  man  im  Bilde  sieht. \r\nIch  möchte  es  gezeichnet  und  mit  den  Farben  illuminiert \r\nhaben,  die  ihm  das  Material  und  das  Alter  gegeben.  Man \r\nmuß  aber  nicht  denken,  daß  der  Baumeister  sich  einen \r\nPalast  errichtet  habe.  Es  ist  das  bescheidenste  Haus  von \r\nder  Welt,  hat  nur  zwei  Fenster,  die  durch  einen  breiten \r\nRaum,  der  das  dritte  Fenster  vertrüge,  abgesondert  sind. \r\nWollte  man  es  zumCiemälde  nachbilden,  so  daß  die  Nach- \r\nbarhäuser mit  vorgestellt  würden,  so  wäre  auch  das  ver- \r\ngnüglich anzusehen,  wie  es  zwischen  sie  eingeschaltet  ist. \r\nDas  hätte  Canaletto  malen  sollen. \r\n\r\nHeute  besuchte  ich  das  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  der  Stadt \r\nauf  einer  angenehmen  Höhe  liegende  Prachthaus,  die \r\nRotonda  genannt.  Es  ist  ein  viereckiges  Gebäude,  das \r\neinen  runden,  von  oben  erleuchteten  Saal  in  sich  schließt. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  59 \r\n\r\nVon  allen  vier  Seiten  steigt  man  auf  breiten  Treppen \r\nhinan  und  gelangt  jedesmal  in  eine  Vorhalle,  die  von \r\nsechs  korinthischen  Säulen  gebildet  wird.  Vielleicht  hat \r\ndie  Baukunst  iliren  Luxus  niemals  höher  getrieben.  Der \r\nRaum,  den  die  Treppen  und  Vorhallen  einnehmen,  ist \r\nviel  größer  als  der  des  Hauses  selbst;  denn  jede  einzelne \r\nSeite  würde  als  Ansicht  eines  Tempels  befriedigen.  In- \r\nwendig kann  man  es  wohnbar,  aber  nicht  wohnlich \r\nnennen.  Der  Saal  ist  von  der  schönsten  Proportion,  die \r\nZimmer  auch;  aber  zu  den  Bedürfnissen  eines  Sommer- \r\naufenthalts einer  vornehmen  Familie  würden  sie  kaum \r\nhinreichen.  Dafür  sieht  man  es  auch  in  der  ganzen  Gegend, \r\nvon  allen  Seiten,  sich  auf  das  herrlichste  darstellen.  Die \r\nMannigfaltigkeit  ist  groß,  in  der  sich  seine  Hauptmasse \r\nzugleich  mit  den  vorspringenden  Säulen  vor  dem  Auge \r\nder  Umherwandelnden  bewegt,  und  die  Absicht  des  Be- \r\nsitzers ist  vollkommen  erreicht,  der  ein  großes  Fidei- \r\nkommißgut  und  zugleich  ein  sinnliches  Denkmal  seines \r\nVermögens  hinterlassen  wollte.  Und  wie  nun  das  Ge- \r\nbäude von  allen  Punkten  der  Gegend  in  seiner  Herrlich- \r\nkeit gesehen  wird,  so  ist  die  Aussicht  von  daher  gleich- \r\nfalls die  angenehmste.  Man  sieht  den  Bachiglione  fließen, \r\nSchifte  von  Verona  herab  gegen  die  Brenta  führend;  dabei \r\nüberschaut  man  die  weiten  Besitzungen,  welche  Marchese \r\nCapra  unzertrennt  bei  seiner  Familie  erhalten  wollte.  Die \r\nInschriften  der  vier  Giebelseiten,  die  zusammen  eine \r\nganze  ausmachen,  verdienen  wohl  aufgezeichnet  zu  werden: \r\nMarcus  Capra  Gabrielis  filius \r\nqui  aedes  has \r\narctissimo  primogeniturae  gradui  subjecit \r\nuna  cum  Omnibus \r\ncensibus  agris  vallibus  et  collibus \r\n\r\ncitra  viam  magnam \r\nmemoriae  perpetuae  mandans  haec \r\ndum  sustinet  ac  abstinet. \r\nDer  Schluß  besonders  ist  seltsam  genug:  ein  Mann,  dem \r\nso  viel  Vermögen  und  Wille  zu  Gebote  stand,  fühlt  noch, \r\ndaß  er  dulden  und  entbehren  müsse.    Das  kann  man  mit \r\ngerinsferm  Aufwand  lernen. \r\n\r\n\r\n6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDen  22.  September. \r\nHeute  abend  war  ich  in  einer  Versammlung,  welche  die \r\nAkademie  der  Olympier  hielt.  Ein  Spielwerk,  aber  ein \r\nrecht  gutes;  es  erhält  noch  ein  bißchen  Salz  und  Leben \r\nunter  den  Leuten.  Ein  großer  Saal  neben  dem  Theater \r\ndes  Palladio,  anständig  erleuchtet,  der  Capitan  und  ein \r\nTeil  des  Adels  zugegen,  übrigens  durchaus  ein  Publikum \r\nvon  gebildeten  Personen,  viele  Geistliche,  zusammen  ohn- \r\ngefähr  fünfhundert. \r\n\r\nDie  von  dem  Präsidenten  für  die  heutige  Sitzung  auf- \r\ngegebene Frage  war:  ob  Erfindung  oder  Nachahmung  den \r\nschönen  Künsten  melir  Vorteil  gebracht  habe?  Der  Ein- \r\nfall war  glücklich  genug;  denn  wenn  man  die  in  der  Frage \r\nliegende  Alternative  trennt,  so  läßt  sich  hundert  Jahre \r\nhinüber  und  herüber  sprechen.  Auch  haben  sich  die \r\nHerrn  Akademiker  dieser  Gelegenheit  weidlich  bedient \r\nund  in  Prosa  und  Versen  mancherlei  hervorgebracht,  wor- \r\nunter viel  Gutes. \r\n\r\nSodann  ist  es  das  lebendigste  Publikum.  Die  Zuhörer \r\nriefen  bravo,  klatschten  und  lachten.  Wenn  man  auch \r\nvor  seiner  Nation  so  stehen  und  sie  persönlich  belustigen \r\ndürfte!  Wir  geben  unser  Bestes  schwarz  auf  weiß:  jeder \r\nkauzt  sich  damit  in  eine  Ecke  und  knopert  daran,  wie  er \r\nkann. \r\n\r\nEs  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  Palladio  auch  diesmal  an  allen \r\nOrten  und  Enden  war,  es  mochte  vom  Erfinden  oder \r\nNachahmen  die  Rede  sein.  Zuletzt,  wo  immer  das  Scherz- \r\nliafteste  gefordert  wird,  hatte  einer  den  glücklichen  Ein- \r\nfall, zu  sagen:  die  andern  hätten  ihm  den  Palladio  weg- \r\ngenommen, er  wolle  dagegen  den  Franceschini  loben, \r\nden  großen  Seidenfabrikanten.  Nun  fing  er  an,  zu  zeigen, \r\nwas  die  Nachahmung  der  Lyoner  und  Florentiner  Stoffe \r\ndiesem  tüchtigen  Unternehmer  und  durch  ihn  der  Stadt \r\nVicenza  für  Vorteil  gebracht  habe,  woraus  erfolge,  daß \r\ndie  Nachahmung  weit  über  die  Erfindung  erhaben  sei. \r\nUnd  dies  geschah  mit  so  gutem  Humor,  daß  ein  ununter- \r\nbrochenes Gelächter  erregt  ward.  Überhaupt  fanden  die, \r\nwelche  für  die  Nachahmung  sprachen,  mehr  Beifall;  denn \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  61 \r\n\r\nsie  sagten  lauter  Dinge,  wie  sie  der  Haufen  denkt  und \r\ndenken  kann.  Einmal  gab  das  Publikum  mit  großem \r\nHändeklatschen  einem  recht  groben  Sophism  seinen  herz- \r\nlichen Beifall,  da  es  viele  gute,  ja  treffliche  Sachen  zu \r\nEhren  der  Erfindung  nicht  gefühlt  hatte.  Es  freut  mich \r\nsehr,  auch  dieses  erlebt  zu  haben,  und  dann  ist  es  höchst \r\nerquickend,  den  Palladio  nach  so  viel  Zeit  immer  noch \r\nals  Polarstern  und  Musterbild  von  seinen  Mitbürgern  ver- \r\nehrt zu  sehen. \r\n\r\nVicenza^  den  23.  September. \r\nHeute  früh  war  ich  in  Tiene,  das  nordwärts  gegen  die \r\nGebirge  liegt,  wo  ein  neu  Gebäude  nach  einem  alten \r\nRisse  aufgeführt  wird,  wobei  wenig  zu  erinnern  sein \r\nmöchte.  So  ehrt  man  hier  alles  aus  der  guten  Zeit  und \r\nhat  Sinn  genug,  nach  einem  geerbten  Plan  ein  frisches \r\nGebäude  aufzuführen.  Das  Schloß  liegt  ganz  trefilich  in \r\neiner  großen  Plaine,  die  Kalkalpen  ohne  Zwischengebirg \r\nhinter  sich.  Vom  Gebäude  her,  neben  der  schnurgeraden \r\nChaussee,  fließt  zu  beiden  Seiten  lebendiges  Wasser  dem \r\nKommenden  entgegen  und  wässert  die  weiten  Reisfelder, \r\ndurch  die  man  fährt. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  nun  erst  die  zwei  italienischen  Städte  gesehen \r\nund  mit  wenig  Menschen  gesprochen,  aber  ich  kenne \r\nmeine  Italiener  schon  gut.  Sie  sind  wie  Hofleute,  die \r\nsich  fürs  erste  Volk  in  der  Welt  halten  und  bei  gewissen \r\nVorteilen,  die  man  ihnen  nicht  leugnen  kann,  sich's  un- \r\ngestraft und  bequem  einbilden  können.  Mir  erscheinen  die \r\nItaliener  als  eine  recht  gute  Nation:  man  muß  nur  die \r\nKinder  und  die  gemeinen  Leute  sehen,  wie  ich  sie  jetzt \r\nsehe  und  sehen  kann,  da  ich  ihnen  immer  ausgesetzt  bin \r\nund  mich  ihnen  immer  aussetze.  Und  was  das  für  Figuren \r\nund  Gesichter  sind! \r\n\r\nBesonders  muß  ich  die  Vicentiner  loben,  daß  man  bei \r\nihnen  die  Vorrechte  einer  großen  Stadt  genießt.  Sie  sehen \r\neinen  nicht  an,  man  mag  machen,  was  man  will;  wendet \r\nman  sich  jedoch  an  sie,  dann  sind  sie  gesprächig  und  an- \r\nmutig, besonders  wollen  mir  die  Frauen  sehr  gefallen. \r\nDie  Veroneserinnen  will  ich  nicht  schelten,  sie  haben  eine \r\n\r\n\r\n62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ngute  Bildung  und  entschiedeneProfile;  aber  meistens  bleich, \r\nund  der  Zendal  tut  ihnen  Schaden,  weil  man  unter  der \r\nschönen  Tracht  auch  etwas  Reizendes  sucht.  Hier  aber \r\nfinde  ich  gar  hübsche  Wesen,  besonders  eine  schwarz- \r\nlockige Sorte,  die  mir  ein  eigenes  Interesse  einflößt.  Es \r\ngibt  auch  noch  eine  blonde,  die  mir  aber  nicht  so  be- \r\nhagen will. \r\n\r\nPadiia^  den  26.  September  abends. \r\nIn  vier  Stunden  bin  ich  heute  von  Vicenza  herübergefahren, \r\nauf  ein  einsitziges  Chaischen,  Sediola  genannt,  mit  meiner, \r\nganzen  Existenz  gepackt.  Man  fährt  sonst  bequem  in  viert- \r\nhalb Stunden;  da  ich  aber  den  köstlichen  Tag  gern  unter \r\nfreiem  Himmel  genießen  wollte,  so  war  es  mir  angenehm, \r\ndaß  der  Vetturin  hinter  seiner  Schuldigkeit  zurückblieb. \r\nMan  fährt  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Ebene  immer  südostwärts, \r\nzwischen  Hecken  und  Bäumen,  ohne  weitere  Aussicht,  bis \r\nman  endlich  die  schönen  Gebirge,  von  Norden  gegen \r\nSüden  streichend,  zur  rechten  Hand  sieht.  Die  Fülle  der \r\nPflanzen-  und  Fruchtgehänge,  über  Mauern  und  Hecken, \r\nan  Bäumen  herunter,  ist  unbesclireiblich.  Kürbisse  be- \r\nschweren die  Dächer,  und  die  wunderlichsten  Gurken \r\nhängen  an  Latten  und  Spalieren. \r\n\r\nDie  herrliche  Lage  der  Stadt  konnte  ich  vom  Observa- \r\ntorium aufs  klarste  überschauen.  Gegen  Norden  Tiroler \r\nGebirge,  beschneit,  in  Wolken  halb  versteckt,  an  die \r\nsich  in  Nordwest  die  Vicentinischen  anschließen,  endlich \r\ngegen  Westen  die  näheren  Gebirge  von  Este,  deren  Ge- \r\nstalten und  Vertiefungen  man  deutlich  sehen  kann.  Gegen \r\nSüdost  ein  grünes  Pflanzenmeer,  ohne  eine  Spur  von \r\nErhöhung,  Baum  an  Baum,  Busch  an  Busch,  Pflanzung \r\nan  Pflanzung,  unzählige  weiße  Häuser,  Villen  und  Kirchen \r\naus  dem  Grünen  hervorblickend.  Am  Horizont  sah  ich \r\nganz  deutlich  den  Markusturm  zu  Venedig  und  andere \r\ngeringere  Türme. \r\n\r\nFadi/a^  den  27.  September. \r\nEndlich  hab'  ich  die  Werke  des  Palladio  erlangt,  zwar \r\nnicht  die  Originalausgabe,  die  ich  in  Vicenza  gesehen, \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  St, \r\n\r\nderen  Tafeln  in  Holz  geschnitten  sind,  aber  eine  genaue \r\nKopie,  ja  ein  Faksimile  in  Kupfer,  veranstaltet  durch  einen \r\nvortrefflichen  Mann,  den  ehemaligen  englischen  Konsul \r\nSmith  in  Venedig.  Das  muß  man  den  Engländern  lassen, \r\ndaß  sie  von  lange  her  das  Gute  zu  schätzen  wußten \r\nund  daß  sie  eine  grandiose  Art  haben,  es  zu  verbreiten. \r\nBei  Gelegenheit  dieses  Ankaufs  betrat  ich  einen  Buch- \r\nladen, der  in  Italien  ein  ganz  eigenes  Ansehen  hat.  Alle \r\nBücher  stehen  geheftet  umher,  und  man  findet  den  ganzen \r\nTag  über  gute  Gesellschaft.  Was  von  Weltgeistlichen, \r\nEdelleuten,  Künstlern  einigermaßen  mit  der  Literatur \r\nverwandt  ist,  geht  hier  auf  und  ab.  Man  verlangt  ein \r\nBuch,  schlägt  nach,  liest  und  unterhält  sich,  wie  es  kommen \r\nwill.  So  fand  ich  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  beisammen, \r\nwelche  sämtlich,  als  ich  nach  den  Werken  des  Palladio \r\nfragte,  auf  mich  aufmerksam  wurden.  Indes  der  Herr  des \r\nLadens  das  Buch  suchte,  rühmten  sie  es  und  gaben  mir \r\nNotiz  von  dem  Originale  und  der  Kopie;  sie  waren  mit \r\ndem  Werke  selbst  und  dem  Verdienst  des  Verfassers \r\nsehr  wohl  bekannt.  Da  sie  mich  für  einen  Architekten \r\nhielten,  lobten  sie  mich,  daß  ich  vor  allen  andern  zu  den \r\nStudien  dieses  Meisters  schritte;  er  leiste  zu  Gebrauch \r\nund  Anwendung  mehr  als  Vitruv  selbst,  denn  er  habe \r\ndie  Alten  und  das  Altertum  gründlich  studiert  und  es \r\nunsern  Bedürfnissen  näher  zu  führen  gesucht.  Ich  unter- \r\nhielt mich  lange  mit  diesen  freundlichen  Männern,  er- \r\nfuhr noch  einiges,  die  Denkwürdigkeiten  der  Stadt  be- \r\ntreffend, und  empfahl  mich. \r\n\r\nDa  man  denn  doch  einmal  den  Heiligen  Kirchen  gebaut \r\nhat,  so  findet  sich  auch  wohl  darin  ein  Platz,  wo  man \r\nvernünftige  Menschen  aufstellen  kann.  Die  Büste  des \r\nKardinals  Bembo  steht  zwischen  ionischen  Säulen,  ein \r\nschönes,  wenn  ich  so  sagen  soll  mit  Gewalt  in  sich  ge- \r\nzogenes Gesicht  und  ein  mächtiger  Bart;  die  Inschrift \r\nlautet: \r\n\r\nPetri  Bembi  Card,  imaginem  Hier.  Guerinus  Ismeni  f.  in \r\n\r\npublico  ponendam  curavit  ut  cujus  ingenii  monumenta \r\n\r\naeterna  sint  ejus  corporis  quoque  memoria  ne  a  poste- \r\n\r\nritate  desideretur. \r\n\r\n\r\n64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDas  Universitätsgebäude  hat  mich  mit  aller  seiner  Würde \r\nerschreckt.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  darin  nichts  zu  lernen \r\nhatte.  Eine  solche  Schulenge  denkt  man  sich  nicht,  ob \r\nman  gleich  als  Studiosus  deutscher  Akademien  auf  den \r\nHörbänken  auch  manches  leiden  müssen.  Besonders  ist \r\ndas  anatomische  Theater  ein  Muster,  wie  man  Schüler \r\nzusammenpressen  soll.  In  einem  spitzen  hohen  Trichter \r\nsind  die  Zuhörer  übereinander  geschichtet.  Sie  sehen \r\nsteil  herunter  auf  den  engen  Boden,  wo  der  Tisch  steht, \r\nauf  den  kein  Licht  fällt;  deshalb  der  Lehrer  bei  Lampen- \r\nschein demonstrieren  muß.  Der  botanische  Garten  ist \r\ndesto  artiger  und  munterer.  Es  können  viele  Pflanzen \r\nauch  den  Winter  im  Lande  bleiben,  wenn  sie  an  Mauern \r\noder  nicht  weit  davon  gesetzt  sind.  Man  überbaut  als- \r\ndann das  Ganze  zu  Ende  des  Oktobers  und  heizt  die \r\nwenigen  Monate.  Es  ist  erfreuend  und  belehrend,  unter \r\neiner  Vegetation  umherzugehen,  die  uns  fremd  ist.  Bei \r\ngewohnten  Pflanzen,  sowie  bei  andern  längst  bekannten \r\nGegenständen,  denken  wir  zuletzt  gar  nichts;  und  was  ist \r\nBeschauen  ohne  Denken?  Hier  in  dieser  neu  mir  ent- \r\ngegentretenden Mannigfaltigkeit  wird  jener  Gedanke \r\nimmer  lebendiger,  daß  man  sich  alle  Pflanzengestalten \r\nvielleicht  aus  ei7icr  entwickeln  könne.  Hierdurch  würde \r\nes  allein  möglich  werden,  Geschlechter  und  Arten  wahr- \r\nhaft zu  bestimmen,  welches,  wie  mich  dünkt,  bisher  sehr \r\nwillkürlich  geschieht.  Auf  diesem  Punkte  bin  ich  in  meiner \r\nbotanischen  Philosophie  stecken  geblieben,  und  ich  sehe \r\nnoch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich  entwirren  will.  Die  Tiefe  und \r\nBreite  dieses  Geschäfts  scheint  mir  völlig  gleich. \r\nDer  große  Platz,  Prato  della  Valle  genannt,  ist  ein  selir \r\nweiter  Raum,  wo  der  Hauptmarkt  im  Juni  gehalten  wird. \r\nHölzerne  Buden  in  seiner  Mitte  geben  freilich  nicht  das \r\nvorteilhafteste  Ansehen,  die  Einwohner  aber  versichern, \r\ndaß  man  auch  bald  hier  eine  Fiera  von  Stein,  wie  die \r\nzu  Verona,  sehen  werde.  Hiezu  gibt  freilich  schon  jetzt  die \r\nUmgebung  des  Platzes  gegründete  Hoftnung,  welche  einen \r\nsehr  schönen  und  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährt. \r\nEin  ungeheures  Oval  ist  ringsum  mit  Statuen  besetzt,  alle \r\nberühmte  Männer  vorstellend,  welche  hier  gelehrt  und \r\n\r\n\r\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  65 \r\n\r\ngelernt  haben.  Einem  jeden  Einheimischen  und  Fremden \r\nist  erlaubt,  irgend  einem  Landsmann  oder  Verwandten \r\nhier  eine  Bildsäule  von  bestimmter  Größe  zu  errichten, \r\nsobald  das  Verdienst  der  Person  und  der  akademische \r\nAufenthalt  zu  Padua  bewiesen  ist. \r\n\r\nUm  das  Oval  umher  geht  ein  Wassergraben.  Auf  den \r\nvier  Brücken,  die  hinaufführen,  stehen  Päpste  und  Dogen \r\nkolossal;  die  übrigen,  kleiner,  sind  von  Zünften,  Partiku- \r\nliers  und  Fremden  gesetzt.  Der  König  von  Schweden \r\nließ  Gustav  Adolfen  hinstellen,  weil  man  sagt,  derselbe \r\nhabe  einmal  in  Padua  eine  Lektion  angehört.  Der  Erz- \r\nherzog Leopold  erneuerte  das  Andenken  Petrarchs  und \r\nGalileis.  Die  Statuen  sind  in  einer  braven  modernen \r\nManier  gemacht,  wenige  übermanieriert,  einige  recht \r\nnatürlich,  sämtlich  im  Kostüm  ihrer  Zeit  und  Würden. \r\nDie  Inschriften  sind  auch  zu  loben.  Es  findet  sich  nichts \r\nAbgeschmacktes  oder  Kleinliches  darunter. \r\nAuf  jeder  Universität  wäre  der  Gedanke  sehr  glücklich \r\ngewesen,  auf  dieser  ist  er  am  glücklichsten,  weil  es  sehr \r\nwohl  tut,  eine  völlige  Vergangenheit  wieder  hervorge- \r\nrufen zu  sehen.  Es  kann  ein  recht  schöner  Platz  werden, \r\nwenn  sie  die  hölzerne  Fiera  wegschafien  und  eine  von \r\nStein  erbauen,  wie  der  Plan  sein  soll. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  Versammlungsorte  einer  dem  heiligen  Antonius \r\ngewidmeten  Brüderschaft  sind  ältere  Bilder,  welche  an \r\ndie  alten  Deutschen  erinnern,  dabei  auch  einige  von \r\nTizian,  wo  schon  der  große  Fortschritt  merklich  ist,  den \r\nüber  den  Alpen  niemand  für  sich  getan  hat.  Gleich  dar- \r\nauf sah  ich  einiges  von  den  Neusten.  Diese  Künstler \r\nhaben,  da  sie  das  hohe  Ernste  nicht  mehr  erreichen \r\nkonnten,  das  Humoristische  sehr  glücklich  getroffen.  Die \r\nEnthauptung  Johannes'  von  Piazetta  ist,  wenn  man  des \r\nMeisters  Manier  zugibt,  in  diesem  Sinne  ein  recht  braves \r\nBild.  Johannes  kniet,  die  Hände  vor  sich  hinfaltend,  mit \r\ndem  rechten  Knie  an  einen  Stein.  Er  sieht  gen  Himmel. \r\nEin  Kriegsknecht,  der  ihn  hinten  gebunden  hält,  biegt \r\nsich  an  der  Seite  herum  und  sieht  ihm  ins  Gesicht,  als \r\nwenn  er  über  die  Gelassenheit  erstaunte,  womit  der  Mann \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  5 \r\n\r\n\r\n66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nsich  hingibt.  In  der  Höhe  steht  ein  anderer,  der  den \r\nStreich  vollführen  soll,  hat  aber  das  Schwert  nicht,  son- \r\ndern macht  nur  mit  den  Händen  die  Gebärde,  wie  einer, \r\nder  den  Streich  zum  voraus  versuchen  will.  Das  Schwert \r\nzieht  unten  ein  dritter  aus  der  Scheide.  Der  Gedanke \r\nist  glücklich,  wenn  auch  nicht  groß,  die  Komposition \r\nfrappant  und  von  der  besten  Wirkung. \r\nIn  der  Kirche  der  Eremitaner  habe  ich  Gemälde  von \r\nMantegna  gesehen,  einem  der  älteren  Maler,  vor  dem \r\nich  erstaunt  bin.  Was  in  diesen  Bildern  für  eine  scharfe, \r\nsichere  Gegenwart  dasteht!  Von  dieser  ganz  wahren, \r\nnicht  etwa  scheinbaren,  eftektlügenden,  bloß  zur  Ein- \r\nbildungskraft sprechenden,  sondern  derben,  reinen,  lich- \r\nten, ausführlichen,  gewissenhaften,  zarten,  umschriebenen \r\nGegenwart,  die  zugleich  etwas  Strenges,  Emsiges,  Müh- \r\nsames hatte,  gingen  die  folgenden  Maler  aus,  wie  ich  an \r\nBildern  von  Tizian  bemerkte,  und  nun  konnte  die  Leb- \r\nhaftigkeit ihres  Genies,  die  Energie  ihrer  Natur,  erleuchtet \r\nvon  dem  Geiste  ihrer  Vorfahren,  auferbaut  durch  ihre \r\nKraft,  immer  höher  und  höher  steigen,  sich  von  der  Erde \r\nheben  und  himmlische,  aber  wahre  Gestalten  hervor- \r\nbringen. So  entwickelte  sich  die  Kunst  nach  der  bar- \r\nbarischen Zeit. \r\n\r\nDer  Audienzsaal  des  Rathauses,  mit  Recht  durch  das \r\nAugmentativum  \"Salone\"  betitelt,  das  ungeheuerste  abge- \r\nschlossene Gefäß,  das  man  sich  nicht  vorstellen,  auch \r\nnicht  einmal  in  der  nächsten  Erinnerung  ziu\"ückrufen  kann. \r\nDreihundert  Euß  lang,  hundert  Euß  breit  und  bis  in  das \r\nder  Länge  nach  ihn  deckende  Gewölbe  hundert  Euß \r\nhoch.  So  gewohnt  sind  diese  Menschen,  im  Freien  zu \r\nleben,  daß  die  Baumeister  einen  Marktplatz  zu  über- \r\nwölben fanden. \r\n\r\nUnd  es  ist  keine  Frage,  daß  der  ungeheuere  überwölbte \r\nRaum  eine  eigene  Empfindung  gibt.  Es  ist  ein  abge- \r\nschloßnes  Unendliches,  dem  ISlenschen  analoger  als  der \r\nSternhimmel.  Dieser  reißt  uns  aus  uns  selbst  hinaus, \r\njener  drängt  uns,  auf  die  gelindeste  Weise,  in  uns  selbst \r\nzurück. \r\nSo  verweil  ich    auch   gern  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  67 \r\n\r\nJustine.  Diese  ist  vierhundertfünfundachtzig  Fuß  lang, \r\nverhältnismäßig  hoch  und  breit,  groß  und  einfach  gebaut. \r\nHeut'  abend  setzt'  ich  mich  in  einen  Winkel  und  hatte \r\nmeine  stille  Betrachtung.  Da  fühlt'  ich  mich  recht \r\nallein,  denn  kein  Mensch  in  der  Welt,  der  in  dem  Augen- \r\nblick an  mich  gedacht  hätte,  würde  mich  hier  gesucht \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nNun  wäre  auch  hier  wieder  einmal  eingepackt;  morgen \r\nfrüh  geht  es  zu  Wasser  auf  der  Brenta  fort.  Heute  hat's \r\ngeregnet,  nun  ist's  wieder  ausgehellt,  und  ich  hoffe,  die \r\nLagunen  und  die  dem  Meer  vermählte  Herrscherin  bei \r\nschöner  Tageszeit  zu  erblicken  und  aus  ihrem  Schoß \r\nmeine  Freunde  zu  begrüßen. \r\n\r\nVENEDIG \r\n\r\nSO  stand  es  denn  im  Buche  des  Schicksals  auf  meinem \r\nBlatte  geschrieben,  daß  ich  1786  den  achtundzwanzig- \r\nsten September,  abends,  nach  unserer  Uhr  um  fünfe, \r\nVenedig  zum  erstenmal,  aus  der  Brenta  in  die  Lagunen \r\neinfahrend,  erblicken  und  bald  darauf  diese  wunderbare \r\nInselstadt,  diese  Biberrepublik,  betreten  und  besuchen \r\nsollte.  So  ist  denn  auch,  Gott  sei  Dank,  Venedig  mir  kein \r\nbloßes  Wort  mehr,  kein  hohler  Name,  der  mich  so  oft, \r\nmich,  den  Todfeind  von  Wortschällen,  geängstiget  hat. \r\nAls  die  erste  Gondel  an  das  Schiff  anfuhr — es  geschieht, \r\num  Passagiere,  welche  Eil'  haben,  geschwinder  nach \r\nVenedig  zu  bringen — erinnerte  ich  mich  eines  frühen \r\nKinderspielzeuges,  an  das  ich  vielleicht  seit  zwanzig \r\nJahren  nicht  mehr  gedacht  hatte.  Mein  Vater  besaß  ein \r\nschönes  mitgebrachtes  Gondelmodell;  er  hielt  es  sehr \r\nwert,  und  mir  ward  es  hoch  angerechnet,  wenn  ich  ein- \r\nmal damit  spielen  durfte.  Die  ersten  Schnäbel  von  blankem \r\nEisenblech,  die  schwarzen  Gondelkäfige,  alles  grüßte  mich \r\nwie  eine  alte  Bekanntschaft,  ich  genoß  einen  langent- \r\nbehrten freundlichen  Jugendeindruck. \r\nIch  bin  gut  logiert  in  der  Königin  von  England,  nicht \r\nweit  vom  Markusplatze,  und  dies  ist  der  größte  Vorzug \r\ndes  Quartiers;  meine  Fenster  gehen  auf  einen  schmalen \r\n\r\n\r\n68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nKanal  zwischen  hohen  Häusern,  gleich  unter  mir  eine \r\neinbogige  Brücke,  und  gegenüber  ein  schmales,  belebtes \r\nGäßchen.  So  wohne  ich,  und  so  werde  ich  eine  Zeitlang \r\nbleiben,  bis  mein  Paket  für  Deutschland  fertig  ist  und \r\nbis  ich  mich  am  Bilde  dieser  Stadt  satt  gesehen  habe. \r\nDie  Einsamkeit,  nach  der  ich  oft  so  sehnsuchtvoll  ge- \r\nseufzt, kann  ich  nun  recht  genießen;  denn  nirgends  fühlt \r\nman  sich  einsamer  als  im  Gewimmel,  wo  man  sich,  allen \r\nganz  unbekannt,  durchdrängt.  In  Venedig  kennt  mich \r\nvielleicht  nur  ein  Mensch,  und  der  wird  mir  nicht  gleich \r\nbegegnen. \r\n\r\nVenedig^  den  28.  September  j^86. \r\nWie  es  mir  von  Padua  hierher  gegangen,  nur  mit  wenig \r\nWorten:  Die  Fahrt  auf  der  Brenta,  mit  dem  öftentlichen \r\nSchiffe,  in  gesitteter  Gesellschaft,  da  die  Italiener  sich \r\nvoreinander  in  acht  nehmen,  ist  anständig  und  ange- \r\nnehm. Die  Ufer  sind  mit  Gärten  und  Lusthäusern  ge- \r\nschmückt; kleine  Ortschaften  treten  bis  ans  Wasser,  teil- \r\nweise geht  die  belebte  Landstraße  daran  hin.  Da  man \r\nschleusenweis  den  Fluß  hinabsteigt,  gibt  es  öfters  einen \r\nkleinen  Aufhalt,  den  man  benutzen  kann,  sich  auf  dem \r\nLande  umzusehen  und  die  reichlich  angebotenen  Früchte \r\nzu  genießen.  Nun  steigt  man  wieder  ein  und  bewegt \r\nsich  durch  eine  bewegte  Welt  voll  Fruchtbarkeit  und \r\nLeben. \r\n\r\nZu  so  viel  abwechselnden  Bildern  und  Gestalten  gesellte \r\nsich  noch  eine  Erscheinung,  die,  obgleich  aus  Deutsch- \r\nland abstammend,  doch  hier  ganz  eigentlich  an  ihrem \r\nPlatze  war,  zwei  Pilger  nämlich,  die  ersten,  die  ich  in \r\nder  Nähe  sah.  Sie  haben  das  Recht,  mit  dieser  öftent- \r\nlichen Gelegenheit  umsonst  weiter  gebracht  zu  werden; \r\nallein  weil  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  ihre  Nähe  scheut,  so \r\nsitzen  sie  nicht  mit  in  dem  bedeckten  Räume,  sondern \r\nhinten  bei  dem  Steuermann.  Als  eine  in  der  gegen- \r\nwärtigen Zeit  seltene  Erscheinung  wurden  sie  angestaunt \r\nund,  weil  früher  unter  dieser  Hülle  manch  Gesindel  um- \r\nhertrieb, wenig  geachtet.  Als  ich  vernahm,  daß  es  Deut- \r\nsche seien,  keiner  andern  Sprache  mächtig,  gesellte  ich \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  69 \r\n\r\nmich  zu  ihnen  und  vernahm,  daß  sie  aus  dem  Paderborni- \r\nschen herstammten.  Beides  waren  Männer  schon  über \r\nfünfzig,  von  dunkler,  aber  gutmütiger  Physiognomie.  Sie \r\nhatten  vor  allem  das  Grab  der  heiligen  drei  Könige  zu \r\nCöln  besucht,  waren  sodann  durch  Deutschland  gezogen \r\nund  nun  auf  dem  Wege,  zusammen  bis  Rom  und  sodann \r\nins  obere  Italien  zurückzugehen,  da  denn  der  eine  wieder \r\nnach  Westfalen  zu  wandern,  der  andere  aber  noch  den \r\nheiligen  Jakob  zu  Compostell  zu  verehren  gedachte. \r\nIhre  Kleidung  war  die  bekannte,  doch  sahen  sie  aufge- \r\nschürzt viel  besser  aus,  als  wir  sie  in  langen  Taffetkleidern \r\nauf  unsern  Redouten  vorzustellen  pflegen.  Der  große \r\nKragen,  der  runde  Hut,  der  Stab  und  die  Muschel,  als \r\ndas  unschuldigste  Trinkgeschirr,  alles  hatte  seine  Be- \r\ndeutung, seinen  unmittelbaren  Nutzen;  die  Blechkapsel \r\nenthielt  ihre  Pässe.  Das  Merkwürdigste  aber  waren  ihre \r\nkleinen  rotsaffianen  Brieftaschen;  in  diesen  befand  sich \r\nalles  kleine  Geräte,  was  nur  irgend  einem  einfachen  Be- \r\ndürfnis abzuhelfen  geeignet  sein  mochte.  Sie  hatten  die- \r\nselben hervorgezogen,  indem  sie  an  ihren  Kleidern  etwas \r\nzu  flicken  fanden. \r\n\r\nDer  Steuermann,  höchst  zufrieden,  daß  er  einen  Dol- \r\nmetscher fand,  ließ  mich  verschiedene  Fragen  an  sie  tun; \r\ndadurch  vernahm  ich  manches  von  ihren  Ansichten,  be- \r\nsonders aber  von  ihrer  Reise.  Sie  beklagten  sich  bitter- \r\nlich über  ihre  Glaubensgenossen,  ja  Weltpriester  und \r\nKlostergeistliche.  Die  Frömmigkeit,  sagten  sie,  müsse \r\neine  sehr  seltene  Sache  sein,  weil  man  an  die  ihrige  nir- \r\ngends glauben  wolle,  sondern  sie  fast  durchaus,  ob  sie \r\ngleich  die  ihnen  vorgeschriebene  geistliche  Marschroute \r\nimd  die  bischöflichen  Pässe  vorgezeigt,  in  katholischen \r\nLanden  wie  Landstreicher  behandle.  Sie  erzählten  da- \r\ngegen mit  Rührung,  wie  gut  sie  von  den  Protestanten \r\naufgenommen  worden,  besonders  von  einem  Landgeist- \r\nlichen in  Schwaben,  vorzüglich  aber  von  seiner  Frau, \r\nwelche  den  einigermaßen  widerstrebenden  Mann  dahin \r\nvermocht,  daß  sie  ihnen  reichliche  Erquickung  zuteilen \r\ndürfen,  welche  ihnen  sehr  not  getan.  Ja  beim  Abschiede \r\nhabe  sie  ihnen  einen  Konventionstaler  geschenkt,   der \r\n\r\n\r\n70  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nihnen  sehr  zustatten  gekommen,  sobald  sie  das  katho- \r\nlische Gebiet  wieder  betreten.  Hierauf  sagte  der  eine \r\nmit  aller  Erhebung,  deren  er  fähig  war:  Wir  schließen \r\ndiese  Frau  aber  auch  täglich  in  unser  Gebet  ein  und  bit- \r\nten Gott,  daß  er  ihre  Augen  öflhe,  wie  er  ihr  Herz  für \r\nuns  geöffnet  hat,  daß  er  sie,  wenn  auch  spät,  aufnehme \r\nin  den  Schoß  der  alleinseligmachenden  Kirche;  und  so \r\nhoffen  wir  gewiß,  ihr  dereinst  im  Paradies  zu  begegnen. \r\nVon  diesem  allen  erklärte  ich,  was  nötig  und  nützlich \r\nwar,  auf  der  kleinen  Steige  sitzend,  die  auf  das  Verdeck \r\nführt,  dem  Steuermanne  und  einigen  andern  Personen, \r\ndie  sich  aus  der  Kajüte  in  den  engen  Raum  gedrängt \r\nhatten.  Den  Pilgern  wurden  einige  ärmliche  Erquickun- \r\ngen gereicht,  denn  der  Italiener  liebt  nicht  zu  geben.  Sie \r\nzogen  hierauf  kleine  geweihte  Zettel  hervor,  worauf  zu \r\nsehen  das  Bild  der  heiligen  drei  Könige,  nebst  lateini- \r\nschen Gebeten  zur  Verehrung.  Die  guten  Menschen  baten \r\nmich,  die  kleine  Gesellschaft  damit  zu  beschenken  und \r\nihr  den  hohen  Wert  dieser  Blätter  begreiflich  zu  machen. \r\nDieses  gelang  mir  auch  ganz  gut,  denn  als  die  beiden \r\nMänner  sehr  verlegen  schienen,  wie  sie  in  dem  großen \r\nVenedig  das  zur  Aufnahme  der  Pilger  bestimmte  Kloster \r\nausfinden  sollten,  so  versprach  der  gerührte  Steuermann, \r\nwenn  sie  landeten,  wollte  er  einem  Burschen  sogleich \r\neinen  Dreier  geben,  damit  er  sie  zu  jenem  entfernt  ge- \r\nlegenen Orte  geleitete.  Sie  würden  zwar,  setzte  er  ver- \r\ntraulich hinzu,  sie  würden  dort  wenig  Trost  finden:  die \r\nAnstalt,  sehr  groß  angelegt,  um  ich  weiß  nicht  wie  viel \r\nPilger  zu  fassen,  sei  gegenwärtig  ziemlich  zusammen- \r\ngegangen, und  die  Einkünfte  würden  eben  anders  ver- \r\nwendet. \r\n\r\nSo  unterhalten,  waren  wir  die  schöne  Brenta  herunter- \r\ngekommen, manchen  herrlichen  Garten,  manchen  herr- \r\nlichen Palast  hinter  uns  lassend,  wohlhabende,  belebte \r\nOrtschaften  an  der  Küste  mit  flüchtigem  Blick  beschauend. \r\nAls  wir  nun  in  die  Lagunen  einfuhren,  umschwärmten \r\nmehrere  Gondeln  sogleich  das  SchiÖ\".  Ein  Lombard,  in \r\nVenedig  wohl  bekannt,  forderte  mich  auf,  ihm  Gesell- \r\nschaft zu  leisten,  damit  wir  geschwinder  drinne  wären \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  71 \r\n\r\nund  der  Doganenqual  entgingen.  Einige,  die  uns  ab- \r\nhalten wollten,  wußte  er  mit  einem  mäßigen  Trinkgeld \r\nzu  beseitigen,  und  so  schwammen  wir,  bei  einem  heitern \r\nSonnenuntergang,  schnell  unserm  Ziel  entgegen. \r\n\r\nDen  2g.  Septet?iber,  Michaelistag  abends. \r\nVon  Venedig  ist  schon  viel  erzählt  und  gedruckt,  daß  ich \r\nmit  Beschreibung  nicht  umständlich  sein  will;  ich  sage \r\nnur,  wie  es  mir  entgegenkömmt.  Was  sich  mir  aber  vor \r\nallem  andern  aufdringt,  ist  abermals  das  Volk,  eine  große \r\nMasse,  ein  notwendiges  unwillkürliches  Dasein. \r\nDieses  Geschlecht  hat  sich  nicht  zum  Spaß  auf  diese  In- \r\nseln geflüchtet;  es  war  keine  Willkür,  welche  die  Fol- \r\ngenden trieb,  sich  mit  ihnen  zu  vereinigen:  die  Not  lehrte \r\nsie  ihre  Sicherheit  in  der  unvorteilhaftesten  Lage  suchen, \r\ndie  ihnen  nachher  so  vorteilhaft  ward  und  sie  klug  machte, \r\nals  noch  die  ganze  nördliche  Welt  im  Düstern  gefangen \r\nlag;  ihre  Vermehrung,  ihr  Reichtum  war  notwendige \r\nFolge.  Nun  drängten  sich  die  Wohnungen  enger  und \r\nenger,  Sand  und  Sumpf  wurden  durch  Felsen  ersetzt; \r\ndie  Häuser  suchten  die  Luft,  wie  Bäume,  die  geschlossen \r\nstehen:  sie  mußten  an  Höhe  zu  gewinnen  suchen,  was \r\nihnen  an  Breite  abging.  Auf  jede  Spanne  des  Bodens \r\ngeizig  und  gleich  anfangs  in  enge  Räume  gedrängt,  ließen \r\nsie  zu  Gassen  nicht  mehr  Breite,  als  nötig  war,  eine \r\nHausreihe  von  der  gegenüberstehenden  zu  trennen  und \r\ndem  Bürger  notdürftige  Durchgänge  zu  erhalten.  Übri- \r\ngens war  ihnen  das  Wasser  statt  Straße,  Platz  und  Spa- \r\nziergang. Der  Venezianer  mußte  eine  neue  Art  von  Ge- \r\nschöpf werden,  wie  man  denn  auch  Venedig  nur  mit  sich \r\nselbst  vergleichen  kann.  Der  große  schlangenförmig  ge- \r\nwundene Kanal  weicht  keiner  Straße  in  der  Welt,  dem \r\nRaum  vor  dem  Markusplatze  kann  wohl  nichts  an  die \r\nSeite  gesetzt  werden:  ich  meine  den  großen  Wasserspiegel, \r\nder  diesseits  von  dem  eigentlichen  Venedig  im  halben \r\nMond  umfaßt  wird.  Über  der  Wasserfläche  sieht  man \r\nlinks  die  Insel  San  Giorgio  Maggiore,  etwas  weiter  rechts \r\ndie  Giudecca  und  ihren  Kanal,  noch  weiter  rechts  die \r\nDogane  und  die  Einfahrt  in  den  Canal  Grande,  wo  uns \r\n\r\n\r\n72  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ngleich  ein  paar  ungeheure  Marmortempel  entgegenleuch- \r\nten. Dies  sind  mit  wenigen  Zügen  die  Hauptgegenstände, \r\ndie  uns  in  die  Augen  fallen,  wenn  wir  zwischen  den  zwei \r\nSäulen  des  Markusplatzes  hervortreten.  Die  sämtlichen \r\nAus-  und  Ansichten  sind  so  oft  in  Kupfer  gestochen,  daß \r\ndie  Freunde  davon  sich  gar  leicht  einen  anschaulichen \r\nBegriff  machen  können. \r\n\r\nNach  Tische  eilte  ich,  mir  erst  einen  Eindruck  des  Gan- \r\nzen zu  versichern,  und  warf  mich,  ohne  Begleiter,  nur \r\ndie  Himmelsgegenden  merkend,  ins  Labyrinth  der  Stadt, \r\nwelche,  obgleich  durchaus  von  Kanälen  und  Kanälchen \r\ndurchschnitten,  durch  Brücken  und  Brückchen  wieder  zu- \r\nsammenhängt. Die  Enge  und  Gedrängtheit  des  Ganzen \r\ndenkt  man  nicht,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben.  Gewöhnlich \r\nkann  man  die  Breite  der  Gasse  mit  ausgereckten  Armen \r\nentweder  ganz  oder  beinahe  messen,  in  den  engsten  stößt \r\nman  schon  mit  den  Ellbogen  an,  wenn  man  die  Hände \r\nin  die  Seite  stemmt;  es  gibt  wohl  breitere,  auch  hie  und \r\nda  ein  Plätzchen,  verhältnismäßig  aber  kann  alles  enge \r\ngenannt  werden. \r\n\r\nIch  fand  leicht  den  großen  Kanal  und  die  Hauptbrücke \r\nRialto;  sie  besteht  aus  einem  einzigen  Bogen  von  weißem \r\nMarmor.  Von  oben  herunter  ist  es  eine  große  Ansicht: \r\nder  Kanal  gesäet  voll  Schiffe,  die  alles  Bedürfnis  vom \r\nfesten  Lande  herbeiführen  und  hier  hauptsächlich  anlegen \r\nund  ausladen;  dazwischen  wimmelt  es  von  Gondeln.  Be- \r\nsonders heute,  als  am  Michaelisfeste,  gab  es  einen  An- \r\nblick wunderschön  lebendig;  doch  um  diesen  einiger- \r\nmaßen darzustellen,  muß  ich  etwas  weiter  ausholen. \r\nDie  beiden  Hauptteile  von  Venedig,  welche  der  große \r\nKanal  trennt,  werden  durch  die  einzige  Brücke  Rialto \r\nmiteinander  verbunden,  doch  ist  auch  für  mehrere  Kom- \r\nmunikation gesorgt,  welche,  in  offenen  Barken,  an  be- \r\nstimmten Überfahrtspunkten  geschieht.  Nun  sah  es  heute \r\nsehr  gut  aus,  als  die  wohlgekleideten,  doch  mit  einem \r\nschwarzen  Schleier  bedeckten  Frauen  sich,  viele  zusam- \r\nmen, übersetzen  ließen,  um  zu  der  Kirche  des  gefeierten \r\nErzengels  zu  gelangen.  Ich  verließ  die  Brücke  und  be- \r\ngab  mich  an  einen  solchen  Überfahrtspunkt,  die  Aus- \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  73 \r\n\r\nsteigenden  genau  zu  betrachten.  Ich  habe  sehr  schöne \r\nGesichter  und  Gestalten  darunter  gefunden. \r\nNachdem  ich  müde  geworden,  setzte  ich  mich  in  eine \r\nGondel,  die  engen  Gassen  verlassend,  und  fuhr,  mir  das  ent- \r\ngegengesetzte Schauspiel  zu  bereiten,  den  nördlichen  Teil \r\ndes  großen  Kanals  durch,  um  die  Insel  der  heiligen  Klara, \r\nin  die  Lagunen,  den  Kanal  der  Giudecca  herein,  bis  ge- \r\ngen den  Markusplatz,  und  war  nun  auf  einmal  ein  Mit- \r\nherr des  Adriatischen  Meeres,  wie  jeder  Venezianer  sich \r\nfühlt,  wenn  er  sich  in  seine  Gondel  legt.  Ich  gedachte  dabei \r\nmeines  guten  Vaters  in  Ehren,  der  nichts  Besseres  wußte, \r\nals  von  diesen  Dingen  zu  erzählen.  Wird  mir's  nicht  auch \r\nso  gehen?  Alles,  was  mich  umgibt,  ist  würdig,  ein  großes \r\nrespektables  Werk  versammelter  Menschenkraft,  ein  herr- \r\nliches Monument,  nicht  eines  Gebieters,  sondern  eines \r\nVolks.  Und  wenn  auch  ihre  Lagunen  sich  nach  und  nach \r\nausfüllen,  böse  Dünste  über  dem  Sumpfe  schweben,  ihr \r\nHandel  geschwächt,  ihre  Macht  gesunken  ist,  so  wird \r\ndie  ganze  Anlage  der  Republik  und  ihr  Wesen  nicht \r\neinen  Augenblick  dem  Beobachter  weniger  ehrwürdig \r\nsein.  Sie  unterliegt  der  Zeit,  wie  alles,  was  ein  erschei- \r\nnendes Dasein  hat. \r\n\r\nDen  30.  September. \r\nGegen  Abend  verlief  ich  mich  wieder,  ohne  Führer,  in \r\ndie  entferntesten  Quartiere  der  Stadt.  Die  hiesigen  Brük- \r\nken  sind  alle  mit  Treppen  angelegt,  damit  Gondeln  und \r\nauch  wohl  größere  Schiffe  bequem  unter  den  Bogen  hin- \r\nfahren. Ich  suchte  mich  in  und  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \r\nzu  finden,  ohne  irgend  jemand  zu  fragen,  mich  abermals \r\nnur  nach  der  Himmelsgegend  richtend.  Man  entwirrt \r\nsich  wohl  endlich,  aber  es  ist  ein  unglaubliches  Gehecke \r\nineinander,  und  meine  Manier,  sich  recht  sinnlich  da- \r\nvon zu  überzeugen,  die  beste.  Auch  habe  ich  mir,  bis \r\nan  die  letzte  bewohnte  Spitze,  der  Einwohner  Betragen, \r\nLebensart,  Sitte  und  Wesen  gemerkt;  in  jedem  Quartiere \r\nsind  sie  anders  beschaffen.  Du  lieber  Gott!  was  doch \r\nder  Mensch  für  ein  armes,  gutes  Tier  ist! \r\nSehr  viele  Häuserchen  stehen  unmittelbar  in  den  Ka- \r\n\r\n\r\n74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nnälen;  doch  gibt  es  hie  und  da  schön  gepflasterte  Stein- \r\ndämnie,  auf  denen  man  zwischen  Wasser,  Kirchen  und \r\nPalästen  gar  angenehm  hin  und  wieder  spaziert.  Lustig \r\nund  erfreuhch  ist  der  lange  Steindamm  an  der  nördlichen \r\nSeite,  von  welchem  die  Inseln,  besonders  Murano,  das \r\nVenedig  im  kleinen,  geschaut  werden.  Die  Lagunen  da- \r\nzwischen sind  von  vielen  Gondeln  belebt. \r\n\r\nAbends. \r\nHeute  habe  ich  abermals  meinen  Begriff  von  Venedig \r\nerweitert,  indem  ich  mir  den  Plan  verschaffte.  Als  ich \r\nihn  einigermaßen  studiert,  bestieg  ich  den  Markusturm, \r\nwo  sich  dem  Auge  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  darstellt.  Es \r\nwar  um  Mittag  und  heller  Sonnenschein,  daß  ich  ohne \r\nPerspektiv  Nähen  und  Fernen  genau  erkennen  konnte. \r\nDie  Flut  bedeckte  die  Lagunen,  und  als  ich  den  Blick \r\nnach  dem  sogenannten  Lido  wandte — es  ist  ein  schmaler \r\nErdstreif,  der  die  Lagunen  schließt — sah  ich  zum  ersten- \r\nmal das  Meer  und  einige  Segel,  darauf.  In  den  Lagunen \r\nselbst  liegen  Galeeren  und  Fregatten,  die  zum  Ritter  Emo \r\nstoßen  sollten,  der  den  Algierern  den  Krieg  macht,  die \r\naber  wegen  ungünstiger  Winde  liegen  bleiben.  Die  Padu- \r\nanischen  und  Vicentinischen  Berge  und  das  Tiroler  Ge- \r\nbirge schließen,  zwischen  Abend  und  Mitternacht,  das \r\nBild  ganz  trefflich  schön. \r\n\r\nDen  I.  Oktober. \r\nIch  ging  und  besah  mir  die  Stadt  in  mancherlei  Rück- \r\nsichten, und  da  es  eben  Sonntag  war,  fiel  mir  die  große \r\nUnreinlichkeit  der  Straßen  auf,  worüber  ich  meine  Be- \r\ntrachtungen anstellen  mußte.  Es  ist  wohl  eine  Art  von \r\nPolizei  in  diesem  Artikel:  die  Leute  schieben  den  Keh- \r\nricht in  die  Ecken;  auch  sehe  ich  große  Schiffe  hin  und \r\nwieder  fahren,  die  an  manchen  Orten  stille  liegen  und \r\ndas  Kehricht  mitnehmen,  Leute  von  den  Inseln  umher, \r\nwelche  des  Düngers  bedürfen;  aber  es  ist  in  diesen  An- \r\nstalten weder  Folge  noch  Strenge  imd  desto  unverzeih- \r\nlicher die  Unreinlichkeit  der  Stadt,  da  sie  ganz  zur  Rein- \r\nlichkeit angelegt  worden,  so  gut  als  irgend  eine  hol- \r\nländische. \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  75 \r\n\r\nAlle  Straßen  sind  geplattet,  selbst  die  entferntesten \r\nQuartiere  wenigstens  mit  Backsteinen  auf  der  hohen \r\nKante  ausgesetzt,  wo  es  nötig,  in  der  Mitte  ein  wenig \r\nerhaben,  an  der  Seite  Vertiefungen,  das  Wasser  aufzu- \r\nfassen und  in  bedeckte  Kanäle  zu  leiten.  Noch  andere \r\narchitektonische  Vorrichtungen  der  ersten  wohlüberdach- \r\nten Anlage  zeugen  von  der  Absicht  trefflicher  Baumeister, \r\nVenedig  zu  der  reinsten  Stadt  zu  machen,  wie  sie  die \r\nsonderbarste  ist.  Ich  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  gleich \r\nim  Spaziergehen  eine  Anordnung  deshalb  zu  entwerfen \r\nund  einem  Polizeivorsteher,  dem  es  Ernst  wäre,  in  Ge- \r\ndanken vorzuarbeiten.  So  hat  man  immer  Trieb  und  Lust, \r\nvor  fremden  Türen  zu  kehren. \r\n\r\nDen  2.  Oktober. \r\nVor  allem  eilte  ich  in  die  Caritä:  ich  hatte  in  des  Pal- \r\nladio  Werken  gefunden,  daß  er  hier  ein  Klostergebäude \r\nangegeben,  in  welchem  er  die  Privatwohnung  der  reichen \r\nund  gastfreien  Alten  darzustellen  gedachte.  Der  sowohl \r\nim  ganzen  als  in  seinen  einzelnen  Teilen  trefflich  ge- \r\nzeichnete Plan  machte  mir  unendliche  Freude,  und  ich \r\nhofi'te  ein  Wunderwerk  zu  finden;  aber  ach!  es  ist  kaum \r\nder  zehnte  Teil  ausgeführt;  doch  auch  dieser  Teil  seines \r\nhimmlischen  Genius  würdig,  eine  Vollkommenheit  in  der \r\nAnlage  und  eine  Genauigkeit  in  der  Ausführung,  die  ich \r\nnoch  nicht  kannte.  Jahrelang  sollte  man  in  Betrachtung \r\nso  eines  Werks  zubringen.  Mich  dünkt,  ich  habe  nichts \r\nHöheres,  nichts  Vollkommneres  gesehen,  und  glaube,  daß \r\nich  mich  nicht  irre.  Denke  man  sich  aber  auch  den \r\ntrefflichen  Künstler,  mit  dem  Innern  Sinn  fürs  Große \r\nund  Gefällige  geboren,  der  erst  mit  unglaublicher  Mühe \r\nsich  an  den  Alten  heranbildet,  um  sie  alsdann  durch  sich \r\nwiederherzustellen.  Dieser  findet  Gelegenheit,  einen  Lieb- \r\nlingsgedanken auszuführen,  ein  Kloster,  so  vielen  Mön- \r\nchen zur  Wohnung,  so  vielen  Fremden  zur  Herberge \r\nbestimmt,  nach  der  Form  eines  antiken  Privatgebäudes \r\naufzurichten. \r\n\r\nDie  Kirche  stand  schon;  aus  ihr  tritt  man  in  ein  Atrium \r\nvon  korinthischen  Säulen,  man  ist  entzückt  und  vergißt \r\n\r\n\r\n76  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nauf  einmal  alles  Pfaffentum.  An  der  einen  Seite  findet \r\nman  die  Sakristei,  an  der  andern  ein  Kapitelzimmer, \r\ndaneben  die  schönste  Wendeltreppe  von  der  Welt,  mit \r\noffener  weiter  Spindel,  die  steinernen  Stufen  in  die  Wand \r\ngemauert  und  so  geschichtet,  daß  eine  die  andere  trägt; \r\nman  wird  nicht  müde,  sie  auf  und  ab  zu  steigen;  wie \r\nschön  sie  geraten  sei,  kann  man  daraus  abnehmen,  daß \r\nsie  Palladio  selbst  für  wohlgeraten  angibt.  Aus  dem  Vor- \r\nhof tritt  man  in  den  innern  großen  Hof.  Von  dem  Ge- \r\nbäude, das  ihn  umgeben  sollte,  ist  leider  nur  die  linke \r\nSeite  aufgeführt,  drei  Säulenordnungen  übereinander,  auf \r\nder  Erde  Hallen,  im  ersten  Stock  ein  Bogengang  vor  den \r\nZellen  hin,  der  obere  Stock  Mauer  mit  Fenstern.  Doch \r\ndiese  Beschreibung  muß  durch  den  Anblick  der  Risse  ge- \r\nstärkt werden.  Nun  ein  Wort  von  der  Ausführung. \r\nNur  die  Häupter  und  Füße  der  Säulen  und  die  Schluß- \r\nsteine der  Bogen  sind  von  gehauenem  Stein,  das  übrige \r\nalles,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  von  Backsteinen,  sondern  von \r\ngebranntem  Ton.  Solche  Ziegeln  kenne  ich  gar  nicht. \r\nFries  und  Karnies  sind  auch  daraus,  die  Glieder  der  Bo- \r\ngen gleichfalls,  alles  teilweise  gebrannt  und  das  Gebäude \r\nzuletzt  nur  mit  wenig  Kalk  zusammengesetzt.  Es  steht \r\nwie  aus  einem  Guß.  'Wäre  das  Ganze  fertig  geworden \r\nund  man  sähe  es  reinlich  abgerieben  und  gefärbt,  es \r\nmüßte  ein  himmlischer  Anblick  sein. \r\nJedoch  die  Anlage  war  zu  groß,  wie  bei  so  manchem  Gebäude \r\nder  neuern  Zeit.  Der  Künstler  hatte  nicht  nur  vorausge- \r\nsetzt, daß  man  das  jetzige  Kloster  abreißen,  sondern  auch \r\nanstoßende  Nachbarshäuser  kaufen  werde;  und  da  mögen \r\nGeld  und  Lust  ausgegangen  sein.  Du  liebes  Schicksal,  das \r\ndu  so  manche  Dummheit  begünstigt  und  verewigt  hast, \r\nwarum  ließest  du  dieses  Werk  nicht  zustande  kommen! \r\n\r\nDen  s-  Oktober. \r\nDie  Kirche  II  Redentore,  ein  schönes  großes  Werk  von \r\nPalladio,  die  Fassade  lobenswürdiger  als  die  von  San \r\nGiorgio.  Diese  mehrmals  in  Kupfer  gestochenen  Werke \r\nmüßte  man  vor  sich  sehen,  um  das  Gesagte  verdeutlichen \r\nzu  können.    Hier  nur  wenige  Worte. \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  77 \r\n\r\nPalladio  war  durchaus  von  der  Existenz  der  Alten  durch- \r\ndrungen und  fühlte  die  Kleinheit  und  Enge  seiner  Zeit \r\nwie  ein  großer  Mensch,  der  sich  nicht  hingeben,  sondern \r\ndas  übrige  so  viel  als  möglich  nach  seinen  edlen  Be- \r\ngrifien  umbilden  will.  Er  war  unzufrieden,  wie  ich  aus \r\ngelinder  Wendung  seines  Buches  schließe,  daß  man  bei \r\nchristlichen  Kirchen  nach  der  Form  der  alten  Basiliken \r\nzu  bauen  fortfahre:  er  suchte  deshalb  seine  heiligen  Ge- \r\nbäude der  alten  Tempelform  zu  nähern;  daher  ent- \r\nstanden gewisse  Unschicklichkeiten,  die  mir  bei  II  Reden- \r\ntore glücklich  beseitigt,  bei  San  Giorgio  aber  zu  auffallend \r\nerscheinen.  Volkmann  sagt  etwas  davon,  trifft  aber  den \r\nNagel  nicht  auf  den  Kopf. \r\n\r\nInwendig  ist  II  Redentore  gleichfalls  köstlich,  alles,  auch \r\ndie  Zeichnung  der  Altäre,  von  Palladio;  leider  die  Ni- \r\nschen, die  mit  Statuen  ausgefüllt  werden  sollten,  prangen \r\nmit  flachen,  ausgeschnittenen,  gemalten  Brettfiguren. \r\n\r\nDem  heiligen  Franziskus  zu  Ehren  hatten  die  Patres \r\nKapuziner  einen  Seitenaltar  mächtig  ausgeputzt:  man \r\nsah  nichts  von  Stein  als  die  korinthischen  Kapitale; \r\nalles  übrige  schien  mit  einer  geschmackvollen  prächtigen \r\nStickerei,  nach  Art  der  Arabesken,  überzogen,  und  zwar \r\nso  artig,  als  man  nur  etwas  zu  sehen  wünschte.  Beson- \r\nders wunderte  ich  mich  über  die  breiten,  goldgestickten \r\nRanken  und  Laubwerke.  Ich  ging  näher  und  fand  einen \r\nrecht  hübschen  Betrug.  Alles,  was  ich  für  Gold  gehalten \r\nhatte^  war  breitgedrücktes  Stroh,  nach  schönen  Zeich- \r\nnungen auf  Papier  geklebt,  der  Grund  mit  lebhaften  Far- \r\nben angestrichen,  und  das  so  mannigfaltig  und  ge- \r\nschmackvoll, daß  dieser  Spaß,  dessen  Material  gar  nichts \r\nwert  war  und  der  wahrscheinlich  im  Kloster  selbst  aus- \r\ngeführt wurde,  mehrere  tausend  Taler  müßte  gekostet \r\nhaben,  wenn  er  echt  hätte  sein  sollen.  Man  könnte  es \r\ngelegentlich  wohl  nachahmen. \r\n\r\nAuf  einem  Uferdamme,  im  Angesicht  des  Wassers,  be- \r\nmerkte ich  schon  einigemal  einen  geringen  Kerl,  welcher \r\neiner  größern  oder  kleinern  Anzahl  von  Zuhörern  im \r\nvenezianischen  Dialekt   Geschichten  erzählte;  ich  kann \r\n\r\n\r\n78  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nleider  nichts  davon  verstehen;  es  lacht  aber  kein  Mensch, \r\nnur  selten  lächelt  das  Auditorium,  das  meist  aus  der  ganz \r\nniedern  Klasse  besteht.  Auch  hat  der  Mann  nichts  Auf- \r\nfallendes noch  Lächerliches  in  seiner  Art,  vielmehr  et- \r\nwas sehr  Gesetztes,  zugleich  eine  bewundrungswürdige \r\nMannigfaltigkeit  und  Präzision,  welche  auf  Kunst  und \r\nNachdenken  hinwiesen,  in  seinen  Gebärden. \r\n\r\nDen  Plan  in  der  Hand,  suchte  ich  mich  durch  die  wunder- \r\nlichsten Irrgänge  bis  zur  Kirche  der  Mendicanti  zu  finden. \r\nHier  ist  das  Konservatorium,  welches  gegenwärtig  den \r\nmeisten  Beifall  hat.  Die  Frauenzimmer  fühj-ten  ein  Ora- \r\ntorium hinter  dem  Gitter  auf,  die  Kirche  war  voll  Zu- \r\nhörer, die  Musik  sehr  schön,  und  herrliche  Stimmen.  Ein \r\nAlt  sang  den  König  Saul,  die  Hauptperson  des  Gedichtes. \r\nVon  einer  solchen  Stimme  hatte  ich  gar  keinen  Begriff; \r\neinige  Stellen  der  Musik  waren  unendlich  schön,  der  Text \r\nvollkommen  singbar,  so  italienisch  Latein,  daß  man  an \r\nmanchen  Stellen  lachen  muß;  die  Musik  aber  findet  hier \r\nein  weites  Feld. \r\n\r\nEs  wäre  ein  trefflicher  Genuß  gewesen,  wenn  nicht  der \r\nvermaledeite  Kapellmeister  den  Takt  mit  einer  Rolle \r\nNoten  wider  das  Gitter  und  so  unverschämt  geklappt \r\nhätte,  als  habe  er  mit  Schuljungen  zu  tun,  die  er  eben \r\nunterrichtete;  und  die  Mädchen  hatten  das  Stück  oft \r\nwiederholt,  sein  Klatschen  war  ganz  unnötig  und  zerstörte \r\nallen  Eindruck,  nicht  anders  als  wenn  einer,  um  uns  eine \r\nschöne  Statue  begreiflich  zu  machen,  ihr  Scharlachläpp- \r\nchen auf  die  Gelenke  klebte.  Der  fremde  Schall  hebt  alle \r\nHarmonie  auf.  Das  ist  nun  ein  Musiker,  und  er  hört  es  nicht, \r\noder  er  will  vielmehr,  daß  man  seine  Gegenwart  durch \r\neine  Unschicklichkeit  vernehmen  soll,  da  es  besser  wäre, \r\ner  ließe  seinen  Wert  an  der  Vollkommenheit  der  Ausführung \r\nerraten.  Ich  weiß,  die  Franzosen  haben  es  an  der  Art; \r\nden  Italienern  hätte  ich  es  nicht  zugetraut,  und  das  Publi- \r\nkum scheint  daran  gewöhnt.  Es  ist  nicht  das  einzige  Mal, \r\ndaß  es  sich  einbilden  läßt,  das  gerade  gehöre  zum  Genuß, \r\nwas  den  Genuß  verdirbt. \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  79 \r\n\r\nGestern  abend  Oper  zu  St.  Moses  (denn  die  Theater  haben \r\nihren  Namen  von  der  Kirche,  der  sie  am  nächsten  liegen); \r\nnicht  recht  erfreuUch!  Es  fehlt  dem  Poem,  der  Musik, \r\nden  Sängern  eine  innere  Energie,  welche  allein  eine  solche \r\nDarstellung  auf  den  höchsten  Punkt  treiben  kann.  Man \r\nkonnte  von  keinem  Teile  sagen,  er  sei  schlecht;  aber  nur \r\ndie  zwei  Frauen  ließen  sich's  angelegen  sein,  nicht  so- \r\nwohl gut  zu  agieren  als  sich  zu  produzieren  und  zu  ge- \r\nfallen. Das  ist  denn  immer  etwas.  Es  sind  zwei  schöne \r\nFiguren,  gute  Stimmen,  artige,  muntere,  gätliche  Per- \r\nsönchen.  Unter  den  Männern  dagegen  keine  Spur  von \r\ninnerer  Gewalt  und  Lust,  dem  Publikum  etwas  aufzuheften, \r\nsowie  keine  entschieden  glänzende  Stimme. \r\nDas  Ballett,  von  elender  Erfindung,  ward  im  ganzen  aus- \r\ngepfififen,  einige  treöliche  Springer  und  Springerinnen \r\njedoch,  welche  letztere  sich  es  zur  Pflicht  rechneten,  die \r\nZuschauer  mit  jedem  schönen  Teil  ihres  Körpers  bekannt \r\nzu  machen,  wurden  weidlich  beklatscht. \r\n\r\nHeute  dagegen  sah  ich  eine  andere  Komödie,  die  mich \r\nmehr  gefreut  hat.  Im  herzoglichen  Palast  hörte  ich  eine \r\nRechtssache  öfientlich  verhandeln;  sie  war  wichtig  und \r\nzu  meinem  Glück  in  den  Ferien  vorgenommen.  Der  eine \r\nAdvokat  war  aUes,  was  ein  übertriebener  BufFo  nur  sein \r\nsollte.  Figur  dick,  kurz,  doch  beweglich,  ein  ungeheuer \r\nvorspringendes  Profil,  eine  Stimme  wie  Erz  und  eine \r\nHeftigkeit,  als  wenn  es  ihm  aus  tiefstem  Grunde  des \r\nHerzens  Ernst  wäre,  was  er  sagte.  Ich  nenne  dies  eine \r\nKomödie,  weil  alles  wahrscheinlich  schon  fertig  ist,  wenn \r\ndiese  öffentliche  Darstellung  geschieht:  die  Richter  wissen, \r\nwas  sie  sprechen  sollen,  und  die  Partei  weiß,  was  sie  zu \r\nerwarten  hat.  Indessen  gefällt  mir  diese  Art  unendlich \r\nbesser  als  unsere  Stuben-  und  Kanzleihockereien.  Und \r\nnun  von  den  Umständen,  und  wie  artig,  ohne  Prunk,  wie \r\nnatürlich  alles  zugeht,  will  ich  suchen  einen  Begriff  zu \r\ngeben. \r\n\r\nIn  einem  geräumigen  Saal  des  Palastes  saßen  an  der  einen \r\nSeite  die  Richter  im  Halbzirkel.  Gegen  ihnen  über,  auf \r\neinem  Katheder,  der  mehrere  Personen  nebeneinander \r\n\r\n\r\n8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nfassen  konnte,  die  Advokaten  beider  Parteien;  unmittel- \r\nbar vor  demselben,  auf  ei7:er  Bank,  Kläger  und  Beklagte \r\nin  eigner  Person.  Der  Advokat  des  Klägers  war  von  dem \r\nKatheder  herabgestiegen,  denn  die  heutige  Sitzung  war \r\nzu  keiner  Kontrovers  bestimmt.  Die  sämtlichen  Doku- \r\nmente für  und  wider,  obgleich  schon  gedruckt,  sollten \r\nvorgelesen  werden. \r\n\r\nEin  hagerer  Schreiber,  in  schwarzem  kümmerlichen  Rocke, \r\nein  dickes  Heft  in  der  Hand,  bereitete  sich,  die  Pflicht \r\ndes  Lesenden  zu  erfüllen.  Von  Zuschauern  und  Zuhörern \r\nwar  übrigens  der  Saal  gedrängt  voll.  Die  Rechtsfrage \r\nselbst  sowie  die  Personen,  welche  sie  betraf,  mußten  den \r\nVenezianern  höchst  bedeutend  scheinen. \r\nFideikommisse  haben  in  diesem  Staat  die  entschiedenste \r\nGunst:  ein  Besitztum,  welchem  einmal  dieser  Charakter \r\naufgeprägt  ist,  behält  ihn  für  ewige  Zeiten;  es  mag  durch \r\nirgend  eine  Wendung  oder  Umstand  vor  mehrern  hundert \r\nJahren  veräußert  worden,  durch  viele  Hände  gegangen \r\nsein,  zuletzt,  wenn  die  Sache  zur  Sprache  kommt,  be- \r\nhalten die  Nachkommen  der  ersten  Familie  recht,  und \r\ndie  Güter  müssen  herausgegeben  werden. \r\nDiesmal  war  der  Streit  höchst  wichtig,  denn  die  Klage \r\nging  gegen  den  Doge  selbst  oder  vielmehr  gegen  seine \r\nGemahlin,  welche  denn  auch  in  Person  auf  dem  Bänkchen, \r\nvom  Kläger  nur  durch  einen  kleinen  Zwischenraum  ge- \r\ntrennt, in  ihren  Zendal  gehüllt  dasaß.  Eine  Dame  von \r\ngewissem  Alter,  edlem  Körperbau,  wohlgebildetem  Ge- \r\nsicht, auf  welchem  ernste,  ja  wenn  man  will  etwas  ver- \r\ndrießliche Züge  zu  sehen  waren.  Die  Venezianer  bildeten \r\nsich  viel  darauf  ein,  daß  die  Fürstin,  in  ilirera  eignen \r\nPalast,  vor  dem  Gericht  und  ihnen  erscheinen  müsse. \r\nDer  Schreiber  fing  zu  lesen  an,  und  nun  ward  mir  erst \r\ndeutlich,  was  ein  im  Angesicht  der  Richter,  unfern  des \r\nKatheders  der  Advokaten,  hinter  einem  kleinen  Tische \r\nauf  einem  niedern  Schemel  sitzendes  Männchen,  besonders \r\naber  die  Sanduhr  bedeute,  die  er  vor  sich  niedergelegt \r\nhatte.  Solange  nämlich  der  Schreiber  liest,  so  lange \r\nläuft  die  Zeit  nicht;  dem  Advokaten  aber,  wenn  er  dabei \r\nsprechen  will,  ist  nur  im  ganzen  eine  gewisse  Frist  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  81 \r\n\r\ngönnt.  Der  Schreiber  liest,  die  Uhr  liegt,  das  Männchen \r\nhat  die  Hand  daran.  Tut  der  Advokat  den  Mund  auf,  so \r\nsteht  auch  die  Uhr  schon  in  der  Höhe,  die  sich  sogleich \r\nniedersenkt,  sobald  er  schweigt.  Hier  ist  nun  die  große \r\nKunst,  in  den  Fluß  der  Vorlesung  hineinzureden,  flüchtige \r\nBemerkungen  zu  machen,  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  erregen  und \r\nzu  fordern.  Nun  kommt  der  kleine  Saturn  in  die  größte \r\nVerlegenheit.  Er  ist  genötigt,  den  horizontalen  und  ver- \r\ntikalen Stand  der  Uhr  jeden  Augenblick  zu  verändern,  er \r\nbefindet  sich  im  Fall  der  bösen  Geister  im  Puppenspiel, \r\ndie  auf  das  schnell  wechselnde  Berlicke!  Berlocke!  des \r\nmutwilligen  Hanswursts  nicht  wissen,  wie  sie  gehen  oder \r\nkommen  sollen. \r\n\r\nWer  in  Kanzleien  hat  kollationieren  hören,  kann  sich  eine \r\nVorstellung  von  dieser  Vorlesung  machen,  schnell,  ein- \r\ntönig, aber  doch  artikuliert  und  deutlich  genug.  Der \r\nkunstreiche  Advokat  weiß  nun  durch  Scherze  die  Lange- \r\nweile zu  unterbrechen,  und  das  Publikum  ergötzt  sich  an \r\nseinen  Spaßen  in  ganz  unmäßigem  Gelächter.  Eines \r\nScherzes  muß  ich  gedenken,  des  auffallendsten  unter \r\ndenen,  die  ich  verstand.  Der  Vorleser  rezitierte  soeben \r\nein  Dokument,  wodurch  einer  jener  unrechtmäßig  ge- \r\nachteten Besitzer  über  die  fraglichen  Güter  disponierte. \r\nDer  Advokat  hieß  ihn  langsamer  lesen,  und  als  er  die \r\nWorte  deutlich  aussprach:  Ich  schenke^  ich  vermache^  fuhr \r\nder  Redner  heftig  auf  den  Schreiber  los  und  rief:  Was \r\nwillst  du  schenken?  was  vermachen?  du  armer  ausge- \r\nhungerter Teufel!  Gehört  dir  doch  gar  nichts  in  der  Welt \r\nan.  Doch,  fuhr  er  fort,  indem  er  sich  zu  besinnen  schien, \r\nwar  doch  jener  erlauchte  Besitzer  in  eben  dem  Fall,  er \r\nwollte  schenken,  wollte  vermachen,  was  ihm  so  wenig \r\ngehörte  als  dir.  Ein  unendlich  Gelächter  schlug  auf,  doch \r\nsogleich  nahm  die  Sanduhr* die  horizontale  Lage  wieder \r\nan.  Der  Vorleser  summte  fort,  machte  dem  Advokaten  ein \r\nflämisch  Gesicht;  doch  das  sind  alles  verabredete  Spaße. \r\n\r\nDen  4.  Oktober. \r\nGestern  war  ich  in  der  Komödie,  Theater  St.  Lukas,  die \r\nmir  viel  Freude  gemacht  hat:  ich  sah  ein  extemporiertes \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  6 \r\n\r\n\r\n82  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nStück  in  Masken,  mit  viel  Naturell,  Energie  und  Bravour \r\naufgeführt.  Freilich  sind  sie  nicht  alle  gleich;  der  Pan- \r\ntalon  sehr  brav,  die  eine  Frau,  stark  und  wohlgebaut, \r\nkeine  außerordentliche  Schauspielerin,  spricht  exzellent \r\nund  weiß  sich  zu  betragen.  Ein  tolles  Sujet,  demjenigen \r\nähnlich,  das  bei  uns  unter  dem  Titel  ''Der  Verschlag''  be- \r\nhandelt ist.  Mit  unglaublicher  Abwechslung  unterhielt  es \r\nmehr  als  drei  Stunden.  Doch  ist  auch  hier  das  Volk \r\nwieder  die  Base,  worauf  dies  alles  ruht:  die  Zuschauer \r\nspielen  mit,  und  die  Menge  verschmilzt  mit  dem  Theater \r\nin  ein  Ganzes.  Den  Tag  über  auf  dem  Platz  und  am \r\nUfer,  auf  den  Gondeln  und  im  Palast,  der  Käufer  und \r\nVerkäufer,  der  Bettler,  der  Schiffer,  die  Nachbarin,  der \r\nAdvokat  und  sein  Gegner,  alles  lebt  und  treibt  und  läßt \r\nsich  es  angelegen  sein,  spricht  und  beteuert,  schreit  und \r\nbietet  aus,  singt  und  spielt,  flucht  und  lärmt.  Und  abends \r\ngehen  sie  ins  Theater  und  sehen  und  hören  das  Leben \r\nihres  Tages,  künstlich  zusammengestellt,  artiger  aufge- \r\nstutzt, mit  Märchen  durchflochten,  durch  Masken  von  der \r\nWirklichkeit  abgerückt,  durch  Sitten  genähert.  Hierüber \r\nfreun  sie  sich  kindisch,  schreien  wieder,  klatschen  und \r\nlärmen.  Von  Nacht  zu  Nacht,  ja  von  Mitternacht  zu \r\nMitternacht  ist  immer  alles  eben  dasselbe. \r\nIch  habe  aber  auch  nicht  leicht  natürlicher  agieren  sehen \r\nals  jene  Masken,  so  wie  es  nur  bei  einem  ausgezeichnet \r\nglücklichen  Naturell  durch  längere  Übung  erreicht  werden \r\nkami. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  das  schreibe,  machen  sie  einen  gewaltigen  T^ärm \r\nauf  dem  Kanal  unter  meinem  Fenster,  und  Mitternacht  ist \r\nvorbei.  Sie  haben  im  Guten  und  Bösen  immer  etwas  zu- \r\nsammen. \r\n\r\nÖffentliche  Redner  habe  ich  nun  gehört:  drei  Kerls  auf \r\ndem  Platze  und  Ufersteindamme,  jeden  nach  seiner  Art \r\nGeschichten  erzählend,  sodann  zwei  Sachwalter,  zwei \r\nPrediger,  die  Schauspieler,  worunter  ich  besonders  den \r\nPantalon  rühmen  muß;  alle  diese  haben  etwas  Gemein- \r\nsames, sowohl  weil  sie  von  ein  und  derselben  Nation  sind, \r\ndie,  stets  öftentlich  lebend,  immer  in  leidenschaftlichem \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  83 \r\n\r\nSprechen  begriffen  ist,  als  auch  weil  sie  sich  untereinander \r\nnachahmen.  Hierzu  kommt  noch  eine  entschiedene  Ge- \r\nbärdensprache, mit  welcher  sie  die  Ausdrücke  ihrer  Inten- \r\ntionen, Gesinnungen  und  Empfindungen  begleiten. \r\nHeute  am  Fest  des  heiligen  Franziskus  war  ich  in  seiner \r\nKirche  alle  Vigne.  Des  Kapuziners  laute  Stimme  ward \r\nvon  dem  Geschrei  der  Verkäufer  vor  der  Kirche  wie  von \r\neiner  Antiphone  begleitet;  ich  stand  in  der  Kirchtüre \r\nzwischen  beiden,  und  es  war  wunderlich  genug  zu  hören. \r\n\r\nDen  j.  Oktober. \r\nHeute  früh  war  ich  im  Arsenal,  mir  immer  interessant \r\ngenug,  da  ich  noch  kein  Seewesen  kenne  und  hier  die \r\nuntere  Schule  besuchte:  denn  freilich  sieht  es  hier  nach \r\neiner  alten  Familie  aus,  die  sich  noch  rührt,  obgleich  die \r\nbeste  Zeit  der  Blüte  und  der  Früchte  vorüber  ist.  Da  ich \r\ndenn  auch  den  Handwerkern  nachgehe,  habe  ich  manches \r\nMerkwürdige  gesehen  und  ein  Schiff  von  vierundachtzig \r\nKanonen,  dessen  Gerippe  fertig  steht,  bestiegen. \r\nEin  gleiches  ist  vor  sechs  Monaten,  an  der  Riva  de' \r\nSchiavoni,  bis  aufs  Wasser  verbrannt;  die  Pulverkammer \r\nwar  nicht  sehr  gefüllt,  und  da  sie  sprang,  tat  es  keinen \r\ngroßen  Schaden.  Die  benachbarten  Häuser  büßten  ihre \r\nScheiben  ein. \r\n\r\nDas  schönste  Eichenholz,  aus  Istrien,  habe  ich  verarbeiten \r\nsehen  und  dabei  über  den  Wachstum  dieses  werten  Baumes \r\nmeine  stillen  Betrachtungen  angestellt.  Ich  kann  nicht \r\ngenug  sagen,  was  meine  sauer  erworbene  Kenntnis  natür- \r\nlicher Dinge,  die  doch  der  Mensch  zuletzt  als  Materialien \r\nbraucht  und  in  seinen  Nutzen  verwendet,  mir  überall  hilft, \r\num  mir  das  Verfahren  der  Künstler  und  Handwerker  zu \r\nerklären;  so  ist  mir  auch  die  Kenntnis  der  Gebirge  und \r\ndes  daraus  genommenen  Gesteins  ein  großer  Vorsprung \r\nin  der  Kunst. \r\n\r\nUm  mit  einem  Worte  den  Begriff  des  Bucentaur  auszu- \r\nsprechen, nenne  ich  ihn  eine  Prachtgaleere.  Der  ältere, \r\nvon  dem  wir  noch  Abbildungen  haben,  rechtfertigt  diese \r\n\r\n\r\n84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nBenennung  noch  mehr  als  der  gegenwärtige,  der  uns  durch \r\nseinen  Glanz  über  seinen  Ursprung  verblendet. \r\nIch  komme  immer  auf  mein  Altes  zurück.  Wenn  dem \r\nKünstler  ein  echter  Gegenstand  gegeben  ist,  so  kann  er \r\netwas  Echtes  leisten.  Hier  war  ihm  aufgetragen,  eine \r\nGaleere  zu  bilden,  die  wert  wäre,  die  Häupter  der  Repu- \r\nblik, am  feierlichsten  Tage,  zum  Sakrament  ihrer  herge- \r\nbrachten Meerherrschaft  zu  tragen,  und  diese  Aufgabe  ist \r\nfürtreft'lich  au.sgeführt.  Das  Schiff  ist  ganz  Zierat,  also \r\ndarf  man  nicht  sagen:  mit  Zierat  überladen;  ganz  ver- \r\nguldetes  Schnitzwerk,  sonst  zu  keinem  Gebrauch,  eine \r\nwahre  Monstranz,  um  dem  Volke  seine  Häupter  recht \r\nherrlich  zu  zeigen.  Wissen  wir  doch:  das  Volk,  wie  es \r\ngern  seine  Hüte  schmückt,  will  auch  seine  Obern  prächtig \r\nund  geputzt  sehen.  Dieses  Prunkschiff  ist  ein  rechtes  In- \r\nventarienstück,  woran  man  sehen  kann,  was  die  Vene- \r\nzianer waren  und  sich  zu  sein  dünkten. \r\n\r\nNac/its. \r\nIch  komme  noch  lachend  aus  der  Tragödie  und  muß \r\ndiesen  Scherz  gleich  auf  dem  Papier  befestigen.  Das \r\nStück  war  nicht  schlimm,  der  Verfasser  hatte  alle  tragischen \r\nMatadore  zusammengesteckt,  und  die  Schauspieler  hatten \r\ngut  spielen.  Die  meisten  Situationen  waren  bekannt, \r\neinige  neu  und  ganz  glücklich.  Zwei  Väter,  die  sich  hassen. \r\nSöhne  und  Töchter  aus  diesen  getrennten  Familien,  leiden- \r\nschaftlich übers  Kreuz  verliebt,  ja  das  eine  Paar  heimUch \r\nverheiratet.  Es  ging  wild  und  grausam  zu,  und  nichts \r\nblieb  zuletzt  übrig,  um  die  jungen  Leute  glücklich  zu \r\nmachen,  als  daß  die  beiden  Väter  sich  erstachen,  worauf \r\nunter  lebhaftem  Händeklatschen  der  Vorhang  fiel.  Nun \r\nward  aber  das  Klatschen  heftiger,  nun  wurde  Fuora  ge- \r\nrufen, und  das  so  lange,  bis  sich  die  zwei  Hauptpaare \r\nbequemten,  hinter  dem  Vorhang  hervorzukriechen,  ihre \r\nl)ücklinge  zu  machen  und  auf  der  andern  Seite  wieder  ab- \r\nzugehen. \r\n\r\nDas  Publikum  war  noch  nicht  befriedigt,  es  klatschte  fort \r\nund  rief  I  morti!  Das  dauerte  so  lange,  bis  die  zwei \r\nToten  auch  herauskamen  und  sich  bückten,  da  denn  einige \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  85 \r\n\r\nStimmen  riefen  Bravi  i  morti!  Sie  wurden  durch  Klatschen \r\nlange  festgehalten,  bis  man  ihnen  gleichfalls  endlich  ab- \r\nzugehen erlaubte.  Diese  Posse  gewinnt  für  den  Augen- \r\nund  Ohrenzeugen  unendlich,  der  das  Bravo!  Bravi!  das \r\ndie  Italiener  immer  im  Munde  führen,  so  in  den  Ohren \r\nhat  wie  ich,  und  dann  auf  einmal  auch  die  Toten  mit \r\ndiesem  Ehrenwort  anrufen  hört. \r\n\r\nGute  Nacht!  so  können  wir  Nordländer  zu  jeder  Stunde \r\nsagen,  wenn  wir  im  Finstern  scheiden;  der  Italiener  sagt \r\nFelicissima  notte!  nur  einmal,  und  zwar  wenn  das  Licht \r\nin  das  Zimmer  gebracht  wird,  indem  Tag  und  Nacht  sich \r\nscheiden,  und  da  heißt  es  denn  etwas  ganz  anderes.  So \r\nunübersetzlich  sind  die  Eigenheiten  jeder  Sprache:  denn \r\nvom  höchsten  bis  zum  tiefsten  Wort  bezieht  sich  alles \r\nauf  Eigentümlichkeiten  der  Nation,  es  sei  nun  in  Cha- \r\nrakter, Gesinnungen  oder  Zuständen. \r\n\r\nDc7i  6.  Oktober. \r\nDie  Tragödie  gestern  hat  mich  manches  gelehrt.  Erst- \r\nlich habe  ich  gehört,  wie  die  Italiener  ihre  eilfsilbigen \r\nJamben  behandeln  und  deklamieren;  dann  habe  ich  be- \r\ngriffen, wie  klug  Gozzi  die  Masken  mit  den  tragischen \r\nFiguren  verbunden  hat.  Das  ist  das  eigentliche  Schau- \r\nspiel für  dieses  Volk:  denn  es  will  auf  eine  krude  Weise \r\ngerührt  sein,  es  nimmt  keinen  innigen,  zärtlichen  Anteil \r\nam  Unglücklichen,  es  freut  sie  nur,  wenn  der  Held  gut \r\nspricht;  denn  aufs  Reden  halten  sie  viel,  sodann  aber \r\nwollen  sie  lachen  oder  etwas  Albernes  vornehmen. \r\nIhr  Anteil  am  Schauspiel  ist  nur  als  an  einem  Wirklichen. \r\nDa  der  Tyrann  seinem  Sohne  das  Schwert  reichte  und \r\nforderte,  daß  dieser  seine  eigne  gegenüberstehende  Ge- \r\nmahlin umbringen  sollte,  fing  das  Volk  laut  an,  sein  Miß- \r\nvergnügen über  diese  Zumutung  zu  beweisen,  und  es \r\nfehlte  nicht  viel,  so  wäre  das  Stück  unterbrochen  worden. \r\nSie  verlangten,  der  Alte  sollte  sein  Schwert  zurückneh- \r\nmen, wodurch  denn  freilich  die  folgenden  Situationen \r\ndes  Stücks  wären  aufgehoben  worden.  Endlich  entschloß \r\nsich  der  bedrängte  Sohn,  trat  ins  Proszenium  und  bat \r\ndemütig,   sie  möchten  sich  nur  noch  einen  Augenblick \r\n\r\n\r\n86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ngedulden,  die  Sache  werde  noch  ganz  nach  Wunsch  ab- \r\nlaufen. Künstlerisch  genommen  aber  war  diese  Situation \r\nnach  den  Umständen  albern  und  unnatürlich,  und  ich  lobte \r\ndas  Volk  um  sein  Gefühl. \r\n\r\nJetzt  verstehe  ich  besser  die  langen  Reden  und  das  viele \r\nHin-  und  Herdissertieren  im  griechischen  Trauerspiele. \r\nDie  Athenienser  hörten  noch  lieber  reden  und  verstanden \r\nsich  noch  besser  darauf  als  die  Italiener;  vor  den  Ge- \r\nrichtsstellen, wo  sie  den  ganzen  Tag  lagen,  lernten  sie \r\nschon  etwas. \r\n\r\nAn  den  ausgeführten  Werken  Palladios,  besonders  an \r\nden  Kirchen,  habe  ich  manches  Tadelnswürdige  neben \r\ndem  Köstlichsten  gefunden.  Wenn  ich  nun  so  bei  mir \r\nüberlegte,  inwiefern  ich  recht  oder  unrecht  hätte  gegen \r\neinen  solchen  außerordentlichen  Mann,  so  war  es,  als  ob \r\ner  dabei  stünde  und  mir  sagte:  das  und  das  habe  ich \r\nwider  Willen  gemacht,  aber  doch  gemacht,  weil  ich  unter \r\nden  gegebenen  Umständen  nur  auf  diese  Weise  meiner \r\nhöchsten  Idee  am  näch.sten  kommen  konnte. \r\nMir  scheint,  soviel  ich  auch  darüber  denke,  er  habe  bei \r\nBetrachtung  der  Höhe  und  Breite  einer  schon  bestehenden \r\nKirche,  eines  altern  Hauses,  wozu  er  Fassaden  errichten \r\nsollte,  nur  überlegt:  wie  gibst  du  diesen  Räumen  die \r\ngrößte  Form.-  im  einzelnen  mußt  du,  wegen  eintretenden \r\nBedürfnisses,  etwas  verrücken  oder  verpfuschen,  da  oder \r\ndort  wird  eine  Unschicklichkeit  entstehen;  aber  das \r\nmag  sein,  das  Ganze  wird  einen  hohen  Stil  haben,  und \r\ndu  wirst  dir  zur  Freude  arbeiten. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  hat  er  das  größte  Bild,  das  er  in  der  Seele  trug, \r\nauch  dahin  gebracht,  wo  es  nicht  ganz  paßte,  wo  er  es \r\nim  einzelnen  zerknittern  und  verstümmeln  mußte. \r\nDer  Flügel  in  der  Caritä  dagegen  muß  uns  deshalb  von \r\nso  hohem  Werte  sein,  weil  der  Künstler  freie  Hand  hatte \r\nund  seinem  Geist  unbedingt  folgen  durfte.  Wäre  das \r\nKloster  fertig  geworden,  so  stünde  vielleicht  in  der  ganzen \r\ngegenwärtigen  Welt  kein  vollkommneres  Werk  der  Bau- \r\nkunst. \r\nWie  er  gedacht  und  wie  er  gearbeitet,  wird  mir  immer \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  87 \r\n\r\nklarer,  je  mehr  ich  seine  Werke  lese  und  dabei  betrachte, \r\nwie  er  die  Alten  behandelt;  denn  er  macht  wenig  Worte, \r\nsie  sind  aber  alle  gewichtig.  Das  vierte  Buch,  das  die \r\nantiken  Tempel  darstellt,  ist  eine  rechte  Einleitung,  die \r\nalten  Reste  mit  Sinn  zu  beschauen. \r\n\r\nDen  7.  Oktober. \r\nGestern  abend  sah  ich  Elektra  von  Crebillon,  auf  dem \r\nTheater  San  Crisostomo,  nämlich  übersetzt.  Was  mir  das \r\nStück  abgeschmackt  vorkam  und  wie  es  mir  fürchterlich \r\nLangeweile  machte,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen. \r\nDie  Akteurs  sind  übrigens  brav  und  wissen  das  Publikum \r\nmit  einzelnen  Stellen  abzuspeisen!  Orest  hat  allein  drei \r\nverschiedene  Erzählungen,  poetisch  aufgestutzt,  in  eii?cr \r\nSzene.  Elektra,  ein  hübsches  Weibchen  von  mittlerer \r\nGröße  und  Stärke  und  fast  französischer  Lebhaftigkeit, \r\neinem  guten  Anstand,  spricht  die  Verse  schön;  nur  be- \r\ntrug sie  sich  von  Anfang  bis  zu  Ende  toll,  wie  es  leider \r\ndie  Rolle  verlangt.  Indessen  habe  ich  doch  wieder  ge- \r\nlernt. Der  italienische,  immer  eilfsilbige  Jambe  hat  für \r\ndie  Deklamation  große  Unbequemlichkeit,  weil  die  letzte \r\nSilbe  durchaus  kurz  ist  und,  wider  Willen  des  Deklama- \r\ntors, in  die  Höhe  schlägt. \r\n\r\nHeute  früh  war  ich  bei  dem  Hochamte,  welchem  der \r\nDoge  jährlich  an  diesem  Tage,  wegen  eines  alten  Siegs \r\nüber  die  Türken,  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen  Justina  bei- \r\nwohnen muß.  Wenn  an  dem  kleinen  Platz  die  vergolde- \r\nten Barken  landen,  die  den  Fürsten  und  einen  Teil  des \r\nAdels  bringen,  seltsam  gekleidete  Schiffer  sich  mit  rot \r\ngemalten  Bmdern  bemühen,  am  Ufer  die  Geistlichkeit,  die \r\nBrüdersch:ni\"ten  mit  angezündeten,  auf  Stangen  und  trag- \r\nbare silbeere  Leuchter  gesteckten  Kerzen  stehen,  drängen, \r\nwogen  'raue  warten,  dann  mit  Teppichen  beschlagene \r\nBrücker  Rühiden  Fahrzeugen  ans  Land  gestreckt  werden, \r\nzuerst  lein  Angen  violetten  Kleider  der  Savj,  dann  die \r\nlangersce,  e  der  Senatoren  sich  auf  dem  Pflaster  ent- \r\nfalten jhte,  da:  der  Alte,  mit  goldener  phrygischer  Mütze \r\ngeschilalamocan  längsten  goldenen  Talar,  mit  dem  Her- \r\n\r\n\r\n88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nmelinmantel,  aussteigt,  drei  Diener  sich  seiner  Schleppe \r\nbemächtigen,  alles  auf  einem  kleinen  Platz  vor  dem  Portal \r\neiner  Kirche,  vor  deren  Türen  die  Türkenfahnen  gehal- \r\nten werden,  so  glaubt  man  auf  einmal  eine'  alte  gewirkte \r\nTapete  zu  sehen,  aber  recht  gut  gezeichnet  und  koloriert. \r\nMir  nordischem  Flüchtling  hat  diese  Zeremonie  viele \r\nFreude  gemacht.  Bei  uns,  wo  alle  Feierlichkeiten  kurz- \r\nröckig  sind  und  wo  die  größte,  die  man  sich  denken  kann, \r\nmit  dem  Gewehr  auf  der  Schulter  begangen  wird,  möchte \r\nso  etwas  nicht  am  Ort  sein.  Aber  hierher  gehören  diese \r\nSchleppröcke,  diese  friedlichen  Begehungen. \r\nDer  Doge  ist  ein  gar  schön  gewachsener  und  schön  ge- \r\nbildeter Mann,  der  krank  sein  mag,  sich  aber  nur  noch \r\nso,  um  der  Würde  willen,  unter  dem  schweren  Rocke \r\ngerade  hält.  Sonst  sieht  er  aus  wie  der  Großpapa  des \r\nganzen  Geschlechts  und  ist  gar  hold  und  leutselig;  die \r\nKleidung  steht  sehr  gut,  das  Käppchen  unter  der  Mütze \r\nbeleidigt  nicht,  indem  es,  ganz  fein  und  dui-chsichtig,  auf \r\ndem  weißesten,  klarsten  Haar  von  der  Welt  ruht. \r\nEtwa  fünfzig  Nobili,  in  langen  dunkelroten  Schleppklei- \r\ndern, waren  mit  ihm,  meist  schöne  Männer,  keine  einzige \r\nvertrackte  Gestalt,  mehrere  groß,  mit  großen  Köpfen, \r\ndenen  die  blonden  Lockenperücken  wohl  ziemten;  vorge- \r\nbaute Gesichter,  weiches,  weißes  Fleisch,  ohne  schwam- \r\nmig und  widerwärtig  auszusehen,  vielmehr  klug,  ohne \r\nAnstrengung,  ruhig,  ihrer  selbst  gewiß,  Leichtigkeit  des \r\nDaseins  und  durchaus  eine  gewisse  Fröhlichkeit. \r\nWie  sich  alles  in  der  Kirche  rangiert  hatte  und  das \r\nHochamt  anfing,  zogen  die  Brüderschaften  zur  Haupttüre \r\nherein  und  zur  rechten  Seitentüre  wieder  hinaus,  nach- \r\ndem sie,  Paar  für  Paar,  das  Weihwasser  empfangen  und \r\nsich  gegen  den  Hochaltar,  den  Dogen  und  den(  Adel  ge- \r\nneigt hatten.  i \r\n\r\nAuf  heute  abend  hatte  ich  mir  den  famosen  Gesang  der \r\nSchiffer  bestellt,  die  den  Tasso  und  Ariost  auf  ihre  eignen \r\nMelodien  singen.  Dieses  muß  wirklich  bestellt  werden, \r\nes  kommt  nicht  gewöhnlich  vor,  es  gehört  vielmehr  zu \r\nden  halbverklungenen  Sagen  der  Vorzeit.    Bei  Monden- \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  89 \r\n\r\nschein  bestieg  ich  eine  Gondel,  den  einen  Sänger  vorn, \r\nden  andern  hinten;  sie  fingen  ihr  Lied  an  und  sangen \r\nabwechselnd  Vers  für  Vers.  Die  Melodie,  welche  wir \r\ndurch  Rousseau  kennen,  ist  eine  Mittelart  zwischen  Choral \r\nund  Rezitativ,  sie  behält  immer  denselben  Gang,  ohne \r\nTakt  zu  haben;  die  Modulation  ist  auch  dieselbige,  nur \r\nverändern  sie,  nach  dem  Inhalt  des  Verses,  mit  einer  Art \r\nvon  Deklamation  sowohl  Ton  als  Maß;  der  Geist  aber, \r\ndas  Leben  davon,  läßt  sich  begreifen  wie  folgt. \r\nAuf  welchem  Wege  sich  die  Melodie  gemacht  hat,  will \r\nich  nicht  untersuchen,  genug,  sie  paßt  gar  trefflich  für \r\neinen  müßigen  Menschen,  der  sich  etwas  vormoduliert \r\nund  Gedichte,  die  er  auswendig  kann,  solchem  Gesang \r\nunterschiebt. \r\n\r\nMit  einer  durchdringenden  Stimme — das  Volk  schätzt \r\nStärke  vor  allem — sitzt  er  am  Ufer  einer  Insel,  eines \r\nKanals,  auf  einer  Barke  und  läßt  sein  Lied  schallen,  so \r\nweit  er  kann.  Über  den  stillen  Spiegel  verbreitet  sich's. \r\nIn  der  Ferne  vernimmt  es  ein  anderer,  der  die  Melodie \r\nkennt,  die  Worte  versteht  und  mit  dem  folgenden  Verse \r\nantwortet;  hierauf  erwidert  der  erste,  und  so  ist  einer \r\nimmer  das  Echo  des  andern.  Der  Gesang  währt  Nächte \r\ndurch,  unterhält  sie,  ohne  zu  ermüden.  Je  ferner  sie  also \r\nvoneinander  sind,  desto  reizender  kann  das  Lied  werden; \r\nwenn  der  Hörer  alsdann  zwischen  beiden  steht,  so  ist  er \r\nam  rechten  Flecke. \r\n\r\nUm  dieses  mich  vernehmen  zu  lassen,  stiegen  sie  am \r\nUfer  der  Giudecca  aus;  sie  teilten  sich  am  Kanal  hin,  ich \r\nging  zwischen  ihnen  auf  und  ab,  so  daß  ich  immer  den \r\nverließ,  der  zu  singen  anfangen  sollte,  und  mich  dem- \r\njenigen wieder  näherte,  der  aufgehört  hatte.  Da  ward \r\nmir  der  Sinn  des  Gesangs  erst  aufgeschlossen.  Als  Stimme \r\naus  der  Feme  klingt  es  höchst  sonderbar,  wie  eine  Klage \r\nohne  Trauer;  es  ist  darin  etwas  unglaublich,  bis  zu \r\nTränen  Rührendes.  Ich  schrieb  es  meiner  Stimmung  zu; \r\naber  mein  Alter  sagte:  6  singolare,  come  quel  canto  in- \r\ntenerisce,  e  molto  piü,  quando  e  piü  ben  cantato.  Er \r\nwünschte,  daß  ich  die  Weiber  vom  Lido,  besonders  die \r\nvon  Malamocco  und  Palestrina  hören  möchte;  auch  diese \r\n\r\n\r\n90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nsängen  den  Tasso  auf  gleiche  und  ähnliche  Melodien. \r\nEr  sagte  ferner:  Sie  haben  die  Gewohnheit,  wenn  ihre \r\nMänner  aufs  Fischen  ins  Meer  sind,  sich  ans  Ufer  zu \r\nsetzen  und  mit  durchdringender  Stimme  abends  diese \r\nGesänge  erschallen  zu  lassen,  bis  sie  auch  von  ferne  die \r\nStimme  der  Ihrigen  vernehmen  und  sich  so  mit  ihnen \r\nunterhalten.  Ist  das  nicht  sehr  schön  .>  Und  doch  läßt \r\nsich  wohl  denken,  daß  ein  Zuhörer  in  der  Nähe  wenig \r\nFreude  an  solchen  Stimmen  haben  möchte,  die  mit  den \r\nWellen  des  Meeres  kämpfen.  Menschlich  aber  und  wahr \r\nwird  der  Begriff  dieses  Gesanges,  lebendig  wird  die \r\nMelodie,  über  deren  tote  Buchstaben  wir  uns  sonst  den \r\nKopf  zerbrochen  haben.  Gesang  ist  es  eines  Einsamen  in \r\ndie  Ferne  und  Weite,  damit  ein  anderer,  Gleichgestimm- \r\nter, höre  und  antworte. \r\n\r\nDen  8.  Oktober. \r\nDen  Palast  Pisani  Moretta  besuchte  ich  wegen  eines  köst- \r\nlichen Bildes  von  Paul  Veronese.     Die  weibliche  Familie \r\ndes  Darius  kniet  vor  Alexandern  und  Hephästion:    die \r\nvoranknieende  Mutter  hält  den  letztern  für  den  König; \r\ner  lehnt  es  ab  und  deutet  auf  den  Rechten.    Man  erzählt \r\ndas  Märchen,  der  Künstler  sei  in  diesem  Palast  gut  auf- \r\ngenommen und  längere  Zeit  ehrenvoll  bewirtet  worden, \r\ndagegen  habe  er  das  Bild  heimlich  gemalt  und,  als  Ge- \r\nschenk, zusammengerollt  unter  das  Bett  geschoben.    Es \r\nverdient  allerdings  einen  besondern  Ursprung  zu  haben, \r\ndenn  es  gibt  einen  Begriff  von  dem  ganzen  Werte  des \r\nMeisters.     Seine  große  Kunst,   ohne  einen  allgemeinen \r\nTon,    der   über  das   ganze  Stück   gezogen  wäre,  durch \r\nkunstreich  verteiltes  Licht  und  Schatten  und  ebenso  weis- \r\nlich abwechselnde  Lokalfarben  die  köstlichste  Harmonie \r\nhervorzubringen,  ist  hier  recht  sichtbar,  da  das  Bild  voll- \r\nkommen erhalten  und  frisch,  wie  von  gestern    vor  uns \r\nsteht:  denn  freilich,  sobald  ein  Gemälde  dieser  Art  ge- \r\nlitten hat,  wird  unser  Genuß  sogleich  getrübt,  ohne  daß \r\nwir  wissen,  was  die  Ursache  sei. \r\n\r\nWer    mit  dem    Künstler   wegen   des  Kostüms   rechten \r\nwollte,  der  dürfte  sich  nur  sagen,  es  habe  eine  Geschichte \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  91 \r\n\r\ndes  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  gemalt  werden  sollen,  und \r\nso  ist  alles  abgetan.  Die  Abstufung  von  der  Mutter  durch \r\nGemahlin  und  Töchter  ist  höchst  wahr  und  glücklich;  die \r\njüngste  Prinzeß,  ganz  am  Ende  knieend,  ist  ein  hübsches \r\nMäuschen  und  hat  ein  gar  artiges,  eigensinniges,  trotziges \r\nGesichtchen,  ihre  Lage  scheint  ihr  gar  nicht  zu  gefallen. \r\n\r\nMeine  alte  Gabe,  die  Welt  mit  Augen  desjenigen  Malers \r\nzu  sehen,  dessen  Bilder  ich  mir  eben  eingedrückt,  brachte \r\nmich  auf  einen  eignen  Gedanken.  Es  ist  offenbar,  daß \r\nsich  das  Auge  nach  den  Gegenständen  bildet,  die  es  von \r\nJugend  auf  erblickt,  und  so  muß  der  venezianische  Maler \r\nalles  klarer  und  heiterer  sehn  als  andere  Menschen.  Wir, \r\ndie  wir  auf  einem  bald  schmutzkotigen,  bald  staubigen, \r\nfarblosen,  die  Widerscheine  verdüsternden  Boden,  und \r\nvielleicht  gar  in  engen  Gemächern  leben,  können  einen \r\nsolchen  Frohblick  aus  uns  selbst  nicht  entwickeln. \r\nAls  ich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  durch  die  Lagunen \r\nfuhr  und  auf  den  Gondelrändern  die  Gondoliere  leicht \r\nschwebend,  buntbekleidet,  rudernd  betrachtete,  wie  sie \r\nauf  der  hellgrünen  Fläche  sich  in  der  blauen  Luft  zeich- \r\nneten, so  sah  ich  das  beste,  frischeste  Bild  der  venezia- \r\nnischen Schule.  Der  Sonnenschein  hob  die  Lokalfarben \r\nblendend  hervor,  und  die  Schattenseiten  waren  so  licht, \r\ndaß  sie  verhältnismäßig  wieder  zu  Lichtern  hätten  dienen \r\nkönnen.  Ein  gleiches  galt  von  den  Widerscheinen  des \r\nmeergrünen  Wassers.  Alles  war  hell  in  hell  gemalt,  so \r\ndaß  die  schäumende  Welle  und  die  Blitzlichter  darauf \r\nnötig  waren,  um  die  Tüpfchen  aufs  i  zu  setzen. \r\nTizian  und  Paul  hatten  diese  Klarheit  im  höchsten  Grade, \r\nund  wo  man  sie  in  ihren  Werken  nicht  findet,  hat  das \r\nBild  verloren  oder  ist  aufgemalt. \r\n\r\nDie  Kuppeln  und  Gewölbe  der  Markuskirche,  nebst  ihren \r\nSeitenflächen,  alles  ist  bilderreich,  alles  bunte  Figuren \r\nauf  goldenem  Grunde,  alles  musivische  Arbeit;  einige \r\nsind  recht  gut,  andere  gering,  je  nachdem  die  Meister \r\nwaren,  die  den  Karton  verfertigten. \r\nEs  fiel  mir  recht  aufs  Herz,  daß  doch  alles  auf  die  erste \r\nErfindung  ankommt  und  daß  diese  das  rechte  Maß,  den \r\n\r\n\r\n92  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nwahren  Geist  habe,  da  man  mit  viereckten  Stückchen \r\nGlas,  und  hier  nicht  einmal  auf  die  sauberste  Weise,  das \r\nGute  sowohl  als  das  Schlechte  nachbilden  kann.  Die \r\nKunst,  welche  dem  Alten  seine  Fußboden  bereitete,  dem \r\nChristen  seine  Kirchenhimmel  wölbte,  hat  sich  jetzt  auf \r\nDosen  und  Armbänder  verkrümelt.  Diese  Zeiten  sind \r\nschlechter,  als  man  denkt. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  Hause  Farsetti  ist  eine  kostbare  Sammlung  von \r\nAbgüssen  der  besten  Antiken.  Ich  schweige  von  denen, \r\ndie  ich  von  Mannheim  her  und  sonst  schon  gekannt,  und \r\nerwähne  nur  neuere  Bekanntschaften.  Eine  Kleopatra  in \r\nkolossaler  Ruhe,  die  Aspis  um  den  Arm  geschlungen  und \r\nin  den  Tod  hinüberschlafend;  ferner  die  Mutter  Niobe, \r\ndie  ihre  jüngste  Tochter  mit  dem  Mantel  vor  den  Pfeilen \r\ndes  Apollo  deckt;  sodann  einige  Gladiatoren,  ein  in  sei- \r\nnen Flügeln  ruhender  Genius,  sitzende  und  stehende \r\nPhilosophen. \r\n\r\nEs  sind  Werke,  an  denen  sich  die  Welt  Jahrtausende \r\nfreuen  und  bilden  kann,  ohne  den  Wert  des  Künstlers \r\ndurch  Gedanken  zu  erschöpfen. \r\n\r\nViele  bedeutende  Büsten  versetzen  mich  in  die  alten \r\nherrlichen  Zeiten.  Nur  fühle  ich  leider,  wie  weit  ich  in \r\ndiesen  Kenntnissen  zurück  bin;  doch  es  wird  vorwärts \r\ngehen,  wenigstens  weiß  ich  den  Weg.  Palladio  hat  mir \r\nihn  auch  dazu,  und  zu  aller  Kunst  und  Leben  geöffnet. \r\nEs  klingt  das  vielleicht  ein  wenig  wunderlich,  aber  doch \r\nnicht  so  paradox,  als  wenn  Jakob  Böhme  bei  Erblickung \r\neiner  zinnernen  Schüssel  durch  Einstrahlung  Jovis  über \r\ndas  Universum  erleuchtet  wurde.  Auch  steht  in  dieser \r\nSammlung  ein  Stück  des  Gebälks  vom  Tempel  des  An- \r\ntonius und  der  Faustina  in  Rom.  Die  vorspringende \r\nGegenwart  dieses  herrlichen  Architekturgebildes  erinnerte \r\nmich  an  das  Kapital  des  Pantheon  in  Mannheim.  Das  ist \r\nfreilich  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  kauzenden,  auf  Krag- \r\nsteinlein übereinander  geschichteten  Heiligen  der  goti- \r\nschen Zierweisen,  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  Tabakspfeifen - \r\nSäulen,  spitze  Türmlein  und  Blumenzacken;  diese  bin  ich \r\nnun,  Gott  sei  Dank,  auf  ewig  los! \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  93 \r\n\r\nNoch  will  ich  einiger  Werke  der  Bildhauerkunst  erwähnen, \r\ndie  ich  diese  Tage  her,  zwar  nur  im  Vorbeigehen,  aber \r\ndoch  mit  Erstaunen  und  Erbauung  betrachtet:  zwei  un- \r\ngeheure Löwen,  von  weißem  Marmor,  vor  dem  Tore  des \r\nArsenals;  der  eine  sitzt  aufgerichtet,  auf  die  Vorder- \r\npfoten gestemmt,  der  andere  liegt — herrliche  Gegenbilder \r\nvon  lebendiger  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Sie  sind  so  groß,  daß \r\nsie  alles  umher  klein  machen  und  daß  man  selbst  zu- \r\nnichte würde,  wenn  erhabene  Gegenstände  uns  nicht  er- \r\nhüben. Sie  sollen  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit  und \r\nvom  Piraeus  in  den  glänzenden  Tagen  der  Republik  hier- \r\nher gebracht  sein. \r\n\r\nAus  Athen  mögen  gleichfalls  ein  paar  Basreliefe  stam- \r\nmen, in  dem  Tempel  der  heiligen  Justina,  der  Türken- \r\nbesiegerin,  eingemauert,  aber  leider  durch  Kirchstühle \r\neinigermaßen  verfinstert.  Der  Küster  machte  mich  auf- \r\nmerksam darauf,  weil  die  Sage  gehe,  daß  Tizian  seine \r\nunendlich  schönen  Engel  im  Bilde,  die  Ermordung  des \r\nheiligen  Petrus  Martyr  vorstellend,  darnach  geformt  habe. \r\nEs  sind  Genien,  welche  sich  mit  Attributen  der  Götter \r\nschleppen,  freilich  so  schön,  daß  es  allen  Begriff  über- \r\nsteigt. \r\n\r\nSodann  betrachtete  ich  mit  ganz  eignem  Gefühl  die \r\nnackte  kolossale  Statue  des  Markus  Agrippa,  in  dem  Hofe \r\neines  Palastes;  ein  sich  ihm  zur  Seite  heraufschlängeln- \r\nder Delphin  deutet  auf  einen  Seehelden.  Wie  doch  eine \r\nsolche  heroische  Darstellung  den  reinen  Menschen  Göt- \r\ntern ähnlich  macht! \r\n\r\nDie  Pferde  auf  der  Markuskirche  besah  ich  in  der  Nähe. \r\nVon  unten  hinauf  bemerkt  man  leicht,  daß  sie  fleckig \r\nsind,  teils  einen  schönen  gelben  Metallglanz  haben,  teils \r\nkupfergrünlich  angelaufen.  In  der  Nähe  sieht  und  erfährt \r\nman,  daß  sie  ganz  verguldet  waren,  und  sieht  sie  über \r\nund  über  mit  Striemen  bedeckt,  da  die  Barbaren  das \r\nGold  nicht  abfeilen,  sondern  abhauen  wollten.  Auch  das \r\nist  gut,  so  blieb  wenigstens  die  Gestalt. \r\nEin  herrlicher  Zug  Pferde!  ich  möchte  einen  rechten \r\nPferdekenner  darüber  reden  hören.     Was  mir  sonderbar \r\n\r\n\r\n94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nscheint,  ist,  daß  sie  in  der  Nähe  schwer  und  unten  vom \r\nPlatz  leicht  wie  die  Hirsche  aussehen. \r\n\r\nIch  fuhr  heute  früh  mit  meinem  Schutzgeiste  aufs  Lido, \r\nauf  die  Erdzunge,  welche  die  Lagunen  schließt  und  sie \r\nvom  Meere  absondert.  Wir  stiegen  aus  und  gingen  quer \r\nüber  die  Zunge.  Ich  hörte  ein  starkes  Geräusch:  es  war \r\n(las  Meer,  und  ich  sah  es  bald,  es  ging  hoch  gegen  das \r\nUfer,  indem  es  sich  zurückzog,  es  war  um  Mittag,  Zeit \r\nder  Ebbe.  So  habe  ich  denn  auch  das  Meer  mit  Augen \r\ngesehen  und  bin  auf  der  schönen  Tenne,  die  es  weichend \r\nzurückläßt,  ihm  nachgegangen.  Da  hätte  ich  mir  die \r\nKinder  gewünscht,  um  der  Muscheln  willen;  ich  habe, \r\nselbst  kindisch,  ihrer  genug  aufgelesen;  doch  widme  ich \r\nsie  zu  einigem  Gebrauch:  ich  möchte  von  der  Feuchtig- \r\nkeit des  Tintenfisches,  die  hier  so  häufig  wegfließt,  etwas \r\neintrocknen. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Lido,  nicht  weit  vom  Meer,  liegen  Engländer \r\nbegraben,  und  weiterhin  Juden,  die  beiderseits  in  ge- \r\nweihtem Boden  nicht  ruhen  sollten.  Ich  fand  das  Grab \r\ndes  edlen  Konsul  Smith  und  seiner  ersten  Frauen;  ich \r\nbin  ihm  mein  Exemplar  des  Palladio  schuldig  und  dankte \r\nihm  auf  seinem  ungeweihten  Grabe  dafür, \r\nlind  nicht  allein  ungeweiht,  sondern  halbverschüttet  ist \r\ndas  Grab.  Das  Lido  ist  immer  nur  wie  eine  Düne  anzu- \r\nsehen; der  Sand  wird  dorthin  geführt,  vom  Winde  hin \r\nund  her  getrieben,  aufgehäuft,  überall  angedrängt.  In \r\nweniger  Zeit  wird  man  das  ziemlich  erhöhte  Monument \r\nkaum  wiederfinden  können. \r\n\r\nDas  Meer  ist  doch  ein  großer  Anblick!  Ich  will  sehen, \r\nin  einem  Fischerkahn  eine  Fahrt  zu  tun:  die  Gondeln \r\nwagen  sich  nicht  hinaus. \r\n\r\nAm  Meere  habe  ich  auch  verschiedene  Pflanzen  gefun- \r\nden, deren  ähnlicher  Charakter  mir  ihre  Eigenschaften \r\nnäher  kennen  ließ:  sie  sind  alle  zugleich  mastig  und \r\nstreng,  saftig  und  zäh,  und  es  ist  offenbar,  daß  das  alte \r\nSalz  des  Sandbodens,  mehr  aber  die  salzige  Luft  ihnen \r\ndiese  Eigenschaften  gibt;    sie  strotzen  von  Säften,  wie \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  95 \r\n\r\nWasserpflanzen,  sie  sind  fest  und  zäh,  wie  Bergpflanzen; \r\nwenn  ihre  Blätterenden  eine  Neigung  zu  Stacheln  haben, \r\nwie  Disteln  tun,  sind  sie  gewaltig  spitz  und  stark.  Ich \r\nfand  einen  solchen  Busch  Blätter;  es  schien  mir  unser \r\nunschuldiger  Huflattich,  hier  aber  mit  scharfen  Wafien \r\nbewatihet,  und  das  Blatt  wie  Leder,  so  auch  die  Samen- \r\nkapseln, die  Stiele,  alles  mastig  und  fest.  Ich  bringe \r\nSamen  mit  und  eingelegte  Blätter  (Eryngium  mari- \r\ntimum). \r\n\r\nDer  Fischmarkt  und  die  unendlichen  Seeprodukte  machen \r\nmir  viel  Vergnügen;  ich  gehe  oft  darüber  und  beleuchte \r\ndie  unglücklichen  aufgehaschten  Meeresbewohner. \r\n\r\nDen  g.  Oktober. \r\nEin  köstlicher  Tag,  vom  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht!  Ich \r\nfuhr  bis  Palestrina  gegen  Chiozza  über,  wo  die  großen \r\nBaue  sind,  Murazzi  genannt,  welche  die  Republik  gegen \r\ndas  Meer  aufführen  läßt.  Sie  sind  von  gehauenen  Stei- \r\nnen und  sollen  eigentlich  die  lange  Erdzunge,  Lido  ge- \r\nnannt, welche  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere  trennt,  vor \r\ndiesem  wilden  Elemente  schützen. \r\n\r\nDie  Lagunen  sind  eine  Wirkung  der  alten  Natur.  Erst \r\nEbbe,  Flut  und  Erde,  gegeneinander  arbeitend,  dann \r\ndas  allmähliche  Sinken  des  Urgewässers  waren  Ursache, \r\ndaß  am  obern  Ende  des  Adriatischen  Meeres  sich  eine \r\nansehnliche  Sumpfstrecke  befindet,  welche  von  der  Flut \r\nbesucht,  von  der  Ebbe  zum  Teil  verlassen  wird.  Die \r\nKunst  hat  sich  der  höchsten  Stellen  bemächtigt,  und  so \r\nliegt  Venedig,  von  hundert  Inseln  zusammen  gruppiert \r\nund  von  hunderten  umgeben.  Zugleich  hat  man,  mit  un- \r\nglaublicher Anstrengung  und  Kosten,  tiefe  Kanäle  in  den \r\nSumpf  gefurcht,  damit  man  auch  zur  Zeit  der  Ebbe  mit \r\nKriegsschiffen  an  die  Hauptstellen  gelangen  könne.  Was \r\nMenschenwitz  und  Fleiß  vor  alters  ersonnen  und  ausge- \r\nführt, muß  Klugheit  und  Fleiß  nun  erhalten.  Das  Lido, \r\nein  langer  Erdstreif,  trennt  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere, \r\nwelches  nur  an  zwei  Orten  hereintreten  kann,  bei  dem \r\nKastell  nämlich  und  am  entgegengesetzten  Ende,  bei \r\nChiozza.     Die  Flut  tritt  gewöhnlich  des  Tages  zweimal \r\n\r\n\r\n96  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nherein,  und  die  Ebbe  bringt  das  Wasser  zweimal  hinaus, \r\nimmer  durch  denselben  Weg  in  denselben  Richtungen. \r\nDie  Flut  bedeckt  die  innern  morastigen  Stellen  und  läßt \r\ndie  erhühteren,  wo  nicht  trocken,  doch  sichtbar. \r\nGanz  anders  wäre  es,  wenn  das  Meer  sich  neue  Wege \r\nsuchte,  die  Erdzunge  angriffe  und  nach  Willkür  hinein \r\nund  heraus  flutete.  Nicht  gerechnet,  daß  die  Örtchen \r\nauf  dem  Lido,  Palestrina,  St.  Peter  und  andere,  unter- \r\ngehen müßten,  so  würden  auch  jene  Kommunikations- \r\nkanäle ausgefüllt  und,  indem  das  Wasser  alles  durchein- \r\nander schlemmte,  das  Lido  zu  Inseln,  die  Inseln,  die \r\njetzt  dahinterliegen,  zu  Erdzungen  verwandelt  werden. \r\nDieses  zu  verhüten,  müssen  sie  das  Lido  verwahren,  was \r\nsie  können,  damit  das  Element  nicht  dasjenige  willkür- \r\nlich angreifen,  hinüber  und  herüber  werfen  möge,  was \r\ndie  Menschen  schon  in  Besitz  genommen,  dem  sie  schon \r\nzu  einem  gewissen  Zweck  Gestalt  und  Richtung  gegeben \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nBei  außerordentlichen  Fällen,  wenn  das  Meer  übermäßig \r\nwächst,  ist  es  besonders  gut,  daß  es  nur  an  zwei  Orten \r\nherein  darf  und  das  übrige  geschlossen  bleibt;  es  kann \r\nalso  doch  nicht  mit  der  größten  Gewalt  eindringen  und \r\nmuß  sich  in  einigen  Stunden  dem  Gesetz  der  Ebbe  unter- \r\nwerfen und  seine  Wut  mindern. \r\n\r\nÜbrigens  hat  Venedig  nichts  zu  besorgen:  die  Langsam- \r\nkeit, mit  der  das  Meer  abnimmt,  gibt  ihr  Jahrtausende \r\nZeit,  und  sie  werden  schon,  den  Kanälen  klug  nach- \r\nhelfend, sich  im  Besitz  zu  erhalten  suchen. \r\nWenn  sie  ihre  Stadt  nur  reinlicher  hielten,  welches  so \r\nnotwendig  als  leicht  ist  und  wirklich,  auf  die  Folge  von \r\nJahrhunderten,  von  großer  Konsequenz.  Nun  ist  zwar \r\nbei  großer  Strafe  verboten,  nichts  in  die  Kanäle  zu \r\nschütten  noch  Kehricht  hineinzuwerfen;  einem  schnell \r\neinfallenden  Regenguß  aber  ist's  nicht  untersagt,  allen \r\nden  in  die  Ecken  geschobnen  Kehricht  aufzurühren,  in \r\ndie  Kanäle  zu  schleppen,  ja,  was  noch  schlimmer  ist,  in \r\ndie  Abzüge  zu  führen,  die  nur  zum  Abfluß  des  Wassers \r\nbestimmt  sind,  und  sie  dergestalt  zu  verschlemmen,  daß \r\ndie  Hauptplätze  in  Gefahr  sind,  unter  Wasser  zu  stehen. \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  97 \r\n\r\nSelbst  einige  Abzüge  auf  dem  kleinen  Markusplatze,  die, \r\nwie  auf  dem  großen,  gar  klug  angelegt  sind,  habe  ich \r\nverstopft  und  voll  Wasser  gesehen. \r\n\r\nWenn  ein  Tag  Regenwetter  einfällt,  ist  ein  unleidlicher \r\nKot;  alles  flucht  und  schimpft,  man  besudelt  beim  Auf- \r\nund  Absteigen  der  Brücken  die  Mäntel,  die  Tabarros, \r\nwomit  man  sich  ja  das  ganze  Jahr  schleppt,  und  da  alles \r\nin  Schuh  und  Strümpfen  läuft,  bespritzt  man  sich  und \r\nschilt;  denn  man  hat  sich  nicht  mit  gemeinem,  sondern \r\nbeizendem  Kot  besudelt.  Das  Wetter  wird  wieder  schön, \r\nund  kein  Mensch  denkt  an  Reinlichkeit.  Wie  wahr  ist  es \r\ngesagt:  das  Publikum  beklagt  sich  immer,  daß  es  schlecht \r\nbedient  sei,  und  weiß  es  nicht  anzufangen,  besser  be- \r\ndient zu  werden.  Hier,  wenn  der  Souverän  wollte,  könnte \r\nalles  gleich  getan  sein. \r\n\r\nHeute  abend  ging  ich  auf  den  Markustumi;  denn  da  ich \r\nneulich  die  Lagunen  in  ihrer  Herrlichkeit,  zur  Zeit  der \r\nFlut,  von  oben  gesehen,  wollt'  ich  sie  auch  zur  Zeit  der \r\nEbbe,  in  ihrer  Demut,  schauen,  und  es  ist  notwendig, \r\ndiese  beiden  Bilder  zu  verbinden,  wenn  man  einen  rich- \r\ntigen Begrift\"  haben  will.  Es  sieht  sonderbar  aus,  ringsum \r\nüberall  Land  erscheinen  zu  sehen,  wo  vorher  Wasser- \r\nspiegel war.  Die  Inseln  sind  nicht  mehr  Inseln,  nur \r\nhöher  bebaute  Flecke  eines  großen  graugrünlichen  Mo- \r\nrastes, den  schöne  Kanäle  durchschneiden.  Der  sumpfige \r\nTeil  ist  mit  Wasserpflanzen  bewachsen  und  muß  sich  auch \r\ndadurch  nach  imd  nach  erheben,  obgleich  Ebbe  und  Flut \r\nbeständig  daran  rupfen  und  wühlen  und  der  Vegetation \r\nkeine  Ruhe  lassen. \r\n\r\nIch  wende  mich  mit  meiner  Erzählung  nochmals  ans  Meer. \r\nDort  habe  ich  heute  die  Wirtschaft  der  Seeschnecken,  Pa- \r\ntellen und  Taschenkrebse  gesehen  und  mich  herzlich  dar- \r\nüber gefreut.  Was  ist  doch  ein  Lebendiges  für  ein  köst- \r\nliches, herrliches  Ding!  wie  abgemessen  zu  seinem  Zu- \r\nstande, wie  wahr,  wie  seiend!  Wie  viel  nützt  mir  nicht  mein \r\nbißchen  Studium  der  Natur,  und  wie  freue  ich  mich,  es \r\nfortzusetzen!  Doch  ich  will,  da  es  sich  mitteilen  läßt,  die \r\nFreunde  nicht  mit  bloßen  Ausrufungen  anreizen. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  7 \r\n\r\n\r\n98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDie  dem  Meere  entgegengebauten  Mauerwerke  bestehen \r\nerst  aus  einigen  steilen  Stufen,  dann  kommt  eine  sacht \r\nansteigende  Fläche,  sodann  wieder  eine  Stufe,  abermals \r\neine  sanft  ansteigende  Fläche,  dann  eine  steile  Mauer \r\nmit  einem  oben  überhängenden  Kopfe.  Diese  Stufen,  diese \r\nFlächen  hinan  steigt  nun  das  flutende  Meer,  bis  es,  in \r\naußerordentlichen  Fällen,  endlich  oben  an  der  Mauer \r\nund  deren  Vorsprung  zerschellt. \r\n\r\nDem  Meere  folgen  seine  Bewohner,  kleine  eßbare  Schnek- \r\nken,  einschalige  Patellen,  und  was  sonst  noch  beweg- \r\nlich ist,  besonders  die  Taschenkrebse.  Kaum  aber  haben \r\ndiese  Tiere  an  den  glatten  Mauern  Besitz  genommen,  so \r\nzieht  sich  schon  das  Meer,  weichend  und  schwellend,  wie \r\nes  gekommen,  wieder  zurück.  Anfangs  weiß  das  Ge- \r\nwimmel nicht,  woran  es  ist,  und  hoftt  immer,  die  salzige \r\nFlut  soll  wiederkehren;  allein  sie  bleibt  aus,  die  Sonne \r\nsticht  und  trocknet  schnell,  und  nun  geht  der  Rückzug \r\nan.  Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  suchen  die  Taschenkrebse \r\nihren  Raub.  Wunderlicher  und  komischer  kann  man \r\nnichts  sehen  als  die  Gebärden  dieser  aus  einem  runden \r\nKörper  und  zwei  langen  Scheren  bestehenden  Geschöpfe; \r\ndenn  die  übrigen  Spinnenfüße  sind  nicht  bemerklich.  Wie \r\nauf  stelzenartigen  Armen  schreiten  sie  einher,  und  so- \r\nbald eine  Patelle  sich  unter  ihrem  Schild  vom  Flecke \r\nbewegt,  fahren  sie  zu,  um  die  Schere  in  den  schmalen \r\nRaum  zwischen  der  Schale  und  dem  Boden  zu  stecken, \r\ndas  Dach  umzukehren  und  die  Auster  zu  verschmausen. \r\nDie  Patelle  zieht  sachte  ihren  Weg  hin,  saugt  sich  aber \r\ngleich  fest  an  den  Stein,  sobald  sie  die  Nähe  des  Feindes \r\nmerkt.  Dieser  gebärdet  sich  nun  wunderlich  um  das \r\nDächelchen  herum,  gar  zierlich  und  alienhaft;  aber  ihm \r\nfehlt  die  Kraft,  den  mächtigen  Muskel  des  weichen  Tier- \r\nchens zu  überwältigen,  er  tut  auf  diese  Beute  Verzicht, \r\neilt  auf  eine  andere  wandernde  los,  und  die  erste  setzt \r\nihren  Zug  sachte  fort.  Ich  habe  nicht  gesehen,  daß  irgend \r\nein  Taschenkrebs  zu  seinem  Zweck  gelangt  wäre,  ob  ich \r\ngleich  den  Rückzug  dieses  Gewimmels  stundenlang,  wie \r\nsie  die  beiden  Flächen  und  die  dazwischen  liegenden \r\nStufen  hinabschlichen,  beobachtet  habe. \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  99 \r\n\r\nDcti  10.  Oktober. \r\nNun  endlich  kann  ich  denn  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  eine  Ko- \r\nmödie gesehen  habe!  Sie  spielten  heut  auf  dem  Theater \r\nSt.  Lukas:  Le  Baruffe  Chiozzotte,  welches  allenfalls  zu \r\nübersetzen  wäre:  Die  Rauf-  und  Schreihändel  von  Chi- \r\nozza.  Die  Handelnden  sind  lauter  Seeleute,  Einwohner \r\nvon  Chiozza,  und  ihre  Weiber,  Schwestern  und  Töchter. \r\nDas  gewöhnliche  Geschrei  dieser  Leute,  im  Guten  und \r\nBösen,  ihre  Händel,  Heftigkeit,  Gutmütigkeit,  Plattheit, \r\nWitz,  Humor  und  ungezwungene  Manieren,  alles  ist  gar \r\nbrav  nachgeahmt.  Das  Stück  ist  noch  von  Goldoni,  und \r\nda  ich  erst  gestern  in  jener  Gegend  war  und  mir  Stim- \r\nmen und  Betragen  der  See-  und  Hafenleute  noch  im \r\nAug'  und  Ohr  widerschien  und  widerklang,  so  machte \r\nes  gar  große  Freude,  und  ob  ich  gleich  manchen  einzel- \r\nnen Bezug  nicht  verstand,  so  konnte  ich  doch  dem  Gan- \r\nzen recht  gut  folgen.  Der  Plan  des  Stücks  ist  folgender. \r\nDie  Einwohnerinnen  von  Chiozza  sitzen  auf  der  Reede \r\nvor  ihren  Häusern,  spinnen,  stricken,  nähen,  klippein, \r\nwie  gewöhnlich;  ein  junger  Mensch  geht  vorüber  und \r\ngrüßt  eine  freundlicher  als  die  übrigen;  sogleich  fängt \r\ndas  Sticheln  an;  dies  hält  nicht  Maße,  es  schärft  sich  und \r\nwächst  bis  zum  Hohne,  steigert  sich  zu  Vorwürfen,  eine \r\nUnart  überbietet  die  andere;  eine  heftige  Nachbarin  platzt \r\nmit  der  Wahrheit  heraus,  und  nun  ist  Schelten,  Schimp- \r\nfen, Schreien  auf  einmal  losgebunden,  es  fehlt  nicht  an \r\nentschiedenen  Beleidigungen,  so  daß  die  Gerichtspersonen \r\nsich  einzumischen  genötigt  sind. \r\n\r\nIm  zweiten  Akt  befindet  man  sich  in  der  Gerichtsstube. \r\nDer  Aktuarius  an  der  Stelle  des  abwesenden  Podesta,  der \r\nals  Nobile  nicht  auf  dem  Theater  hätte  erscheinen  dürfen, \r\nder  Aktuarius  also  läßt  die  Frauen  einzeln  vorfordern: \r\ndieses  wird  dadurch  bedenklich,  daß  er  selbst  in  die  erste \r\nLiebhaberin  verliebt  ist  und,  sehr  glücklich  sie  allein  zu \r\nsprechen,  anstatt  sie  zu  verhören  ihr  eine  Liebeserklärung \r\ntut.  Eine  andere,  die  in  den  Aktuarius  verliebt  ist,  stürzt \r\neifersüchtig  herein,  der  aufgeregte  Liebhaber  der  ersten \r\ngleichfalls,   die   übrigen   folgen,   neue   Vorwürfe  häufen \r\n\r\n\r\nloo  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nsich,  und  nun  ist  der  Teufel  in  der  Gerichtsstube  los,  wie \r\nvorher  auf  dem  Hafenplatz. \r\n\r\nIm  dritten  Akt  steigert  sich  der  Scherz,  und  das  Ganze \r\nendet  mit  einer  eiligen  notdürftigen  Auflösung.  Der  glück- \r\nlichste Gedanke  jedoch  ist  in  einem  Charakter  ausge- \r\ndrückt, der  sich  folgendermaßen  darstellt. \r\nEin  alter  Schiffer,  dessen  Gliedmaßen,  besonders  aber \r\ndie  Sprachorgane,  durch  eine  von  Jugend  auf  geführte \r\nharte  Lebensart  stockend  geworden,  tritt  auf,  als  Gegen- \r\nsatz des  beweglichen,  schwätzenden,  schreiseligen  Volkes; \r\ner  nimmt  immer  erst  einen  Anlauf  durch  Bewegung  der \r\nLippen  und  Nachhelfen  der  Hände  und  Arme,  bis  er \r\ndenn  endlich,  was  er  gedacht,  herausstößt.  Weil  ihm \r\ndieses  aber  nur  in  kurzen  Sätzen  gelingt,  so  hat  er  sich \r\neinen  lakonischen  Ernst  angewöhnt,  dergestalt,  daß  alles, \r\nwas  er  sagt,  sprüchwörtlich  oder  sentenzios  klingt,  wo- \r\ndurch denn  das  übrige  wilde,  leidenschaftliche  Handeln \r\ngar  schön  ins  Gleichgewicht  gesetzt  wird. \r\nAber  auch  so  eine  Lust  habe  ich  noch  nie  erlebt,  als  das \r\nVolk  laut  werden  ließ,  sich  und  die  Seinigen  so  natürlich \r\nvorstellen  zu  sehen.  Ein  Gelächter  und  Gejauchze  von \r\nAnfang  bis  zu  Ende.  Ich  muß  aber  auch  gestehen,  daß \r\ndie  Schauspieler  es  vortrefflich  machten.  Sie  hatten  sich, \r\nnach  Anlage  der  Charaktere,  in  die  verschiedenen  Stim- \r\nmen geteilt,  welche  unter  dem  Volk  gewöhnlich  vorkom- \r\nmen. Die  erste  Aktrice  war  allerliebst,  viel  besser  als  neu- \r\nlich in  Heldentracht  und  Leidenschaft.  Die  Frauen  über- \r\nhaupt, besonders  aber  diese,  ahmten  Stimme,  Gebärden \r\nund  Wesen  des  Volks  aufs  anmutigste  nach.  Großes  Lob \r\nverdient  der  Verfasser,  der  aus  nichts  den  angenehmsten \r\nZeitvertreib  gel)ildet  hat.  Das  kann  man  aber  auch  nur \r\nunmittelbar  seinem  eignen  lebenslustigen  Volk.  Es  ist \r\ndurchaus  mit  einer  geübten  Hand  geschrieben. \r\nVon  der  Truppe  Sacchi,  für  welche  Gozzi  arbeitete  und \r\ndie  übrigens  zerstreut  ist,  habe  ich  die  Smeraldina  ge- \r\nsehen, eine  kleine,  dicke  Figur,  voller  Leben,  Gewandt- \r\nheit und  guten  Humors.  Mit  ihr  sah  ich  den  }3righella, \r\neinen  hagem,  wohlgebauten,  besonders  in  Mienen-  und \r\nHändespiel  trefilichen  Schauspieler.    Diese  Masken,  die \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  loi \r\n\r\nwir  fast  nur  als  Mumien  kennen,  da  sie  für  uns  weder \r\nLeben  noch  Bedeutung  haben,  tun  hier  gar  zu  wohl,  als \r\nGeschöpfe  dieser  Landschaft.  Die  ausgezeichneten  Alter, \r\nCharaktere  und  Stände  haben  sich  in  wunderlichen  Klei- \r\ndern verkörpert,  und  wenn  man  selbst  den  größten  Teil \r\ndes  Jahrs  mit  der  Maske  herumläuft,  so  findet  man  nichts \r\nnatürlicher,  als  daß  da  droben  auch  schwarze  Gesichter \r\nerscheinen. \r\n\r\nDen  II.  Oktober. \r\n\r\nUnd  weil  die  Einsamkeit  in  einer  so  großen  Menschen- \r\nmasse denn  doch  zuletzt  nicht  recht  möglich  sein  will, \r\nso  bin  ich  mit  einem  alten  Franzosen  zusammengekom- \r\nmen, der  kein  Italienisch  kann,  sich  wie  verraten  und \r\nverkauft  fühlt  und,  mit  allen  Empfehlungsschreiben,  doch \r\nnicht  recht  weiß,  woran  er  ist.  Ein  Mann  von  Stande, \r\nsehr  guter  Lebensart,  der  aber  nicht  aus  sich  heraus  kann; \r\ner  mag  stark  in  den  Funfzigen  sein  und  hat  zu  Hause  einen \r\nsiebenjährigen  Knaben,  von  dem  er  bänglich  Nachrichten \r\nerwartet.  Ich  habe  ihm  einige  Gefälligkeiten  erzeigt;  er \r\nreist  durch  Italien  bequem,  aber  geschwind,  um  es  doch \r\neinmal  gesehen  zu  haben,  und  mag  sich  gern  im  Vorbei- \r\ngehen so  viel  wie  möglich  unterrichten;  ich  gebe  ihm \r\nAuskunft  über  manches.  Als  ich  mit  ihm  von  Venedig \r\nsprach,  fragte  er  mich,  wie  lange  ich  hier  sei,  und  als  er \r\nhörte,  nur  vierzehn  Tage  und  zum  erstenmal,  versetzte \r\ner:  II  parait  que  vous  n'avez  pas  perdu  votre  temps.  Das \r\nist  das  erste  Testimonium  meines  Wohlverhaltens,  das \r\nich  aufweisen  kann.  Er  ist  nun  acht  Tage  hier  und \r\ngeht  morgen  fort.  Es  war  mir  köstlich,  einen  recht  ein- \r\ngefleischten Versailler  in  der  Fremde  zu  sehen.  Der \r\nreist  nun  auch!  und  ich  betrachtete  mit  Erstaunen,  wie \r\nman  reisen  kann,  ohne  etwas  außer  sich  gewahr  zu  wer- \r\nden; und  er  ist  in  seiner  Art  ein  recht  gebildeter,  wackrer, \r\nordentlicher  Mann. \r\n\r\nDen  12.  Oktober. \r\nGestern  gaben  sie  zu  St.  Lukas  ein  neues  Stück:  LTngli- \r\ncismo  in  Italia.    Da  viele  Engländer  in  Italien  leben,  so \r\n\r\n\r\nI02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nist  es  natürlich,  daß  ihre  Sitten  bemerkt  werden,  und \r\nich  dachte  hier  zu  erfahren,  wie  die  ItaHener  diese  rei- \r\nchen und  ihnen  so  willkommenen  Gäste  betrachten;  aber \r\nes  war  ganz  und  gar  nichts.  Einige  glückliche  Narren- \r\nszenen, wie  immer,  das  übrige  aber  zu  schwer  und  ernst- \r\nlich gemeint,  und  denn  doch  keine  Spur  von  englischem \r\nSinn;  die  gewöhnlichen  italienischen  sittlichen  Gemein- \r\nsprüche, und  auch  nur  auf  das  Gemeinste  gerichtet. \r\nAuch  gefiel  es  nicht  und  war  auf  dem  Punkt,  ausgepfiffen \r\nzu  werden;  die  Schauspieler  fühlten  sich  nicht  in  ihrem \r\nElemente,  nicht  auf  dem  Platze  von  Chiozza.  Da  dies \r\ndas  letzte  Stück  ist,  was  ich  hier  sehe,  so  scheint  es,  mein \r\nEnthusiasmus  für  jene  Nationalrepräsentation  sollte  noch \r\ndurch  diese  Folie  erhöht  werden. \r\n\r\nNachdem  ich  zum  Schluß  mein  Tagebuch  durchgegangen, \r\nkleine  Schreibtafelbemerkungen  eingeschaltet,  so  sollen \r\ndie  Akten  inrotuliert  und  den  Freunden  zum  Urteils- \r\nspruch zugeschickt  werden.  Schon  jetzt  finde  ich  man- \r\nches in  diesen  Blättern,  das  ich  näher  bestimmen,  er- \r\nweitern und  verbessern  könnte;  es  mag  stehen  als  Denk- \r\nmal des  ersten  Eindrucks,  der,  wenn  er  auch  nicht  immer \r\nwahr  wäre,  uns  doch  köstlich  und  wert  bleibt.  Könnte \r\nich  nur  den  Freunden  einen  Hauch  dieser  leichtern  Exi- \r\nstenz hinübersenden!  Jawohl  ist  dem  Italiener  das  Ultra- \r\nmontane eine  dunkle  Vorstellung,  auch  mir  kommt  das \r\nJenseits  der  Alpen  nun  düster  vor;  doch  winken  freund- \r\nliche Gestalten  immer  aus  dem  Nebel.  Nur  das  Klima \r\nwürde  mich  reizen,  diese  Gegenden  jenen  vorzuziehen; \r\ndenn  Geburt  und  Gewohnheit  sind  mächtige  Fesseln.  Ich \r\nmöchte  hier  nicht  leben,  wie  überall  an  keinem  Orte,  wo  ich \r\nunbeschäftigt  wäre;  jetzt  macht  mir  das  Neue  unendlich \r\nviel  zu  Schäften.  Die  Baukunst  steigt  wie  ein  alter  Geist \r\naus  dem  Grabe  hervor,  sie  heißt  mich  ihre  Lehren,  wie \r\ndie  Regeln  einer  ausgestorbenen  Sprache,  studieren, \r\nnicht  um  sie  auszuüben  oder  mich  in  ihr  lebendig  zu \r\nerfreuen,  sondern  nur  um  die  ehrwürdige,  für  ewig  ab- \r\ngeschiedene Existenz  der  vergangenen  Zeitalter  in  einem \r\nstillen  Gemüte  zu  verehren.    Da  Palladio  alles  auf  Vitruv \r\n\r\n\r\nVENEDIG  1786  103 \r\n\r\nbezieht,  so  habe  ich  mir  auch  die  Ausgabe  des  Galiani \r\nangeschaftt:  allein  dieser  Foliante  lastet  in  meinem  Ge- \r\npäck wie  das  Studium  desselben  auf  meinem  Gehirn. \r\nPalladio  hat  mir  durch  seine  Worte  und  Werke,  durch \r\nseine  Art  und  Weise  des  Denkens  und  Schaffens  den \r\nVitruv  schon  näher  gebracht  und  verdolmetscht,  besser \r\nals  die  italienische  Übersetzung  tun  kann.  Vitruv  liest \r\nsich  nicht  so  leicht;  das  Buch  ist  an  sich  schon  düster \r\ngeschrieben  und  fordert  ein  kritisches  Studium.  Dem- \r\nohngeachtet  lese  ich  es  flüchtig  durch,  und  es  bleibt  mir \r\nmancher  würdige  Eindruck.  Besser  zu  sagen:  ich  lese \r\nes  wie  ein  Brevier,  mehr  aus  Andacht  als  zur  Belehrung. \r\nSchon  bricht  die  Nacht  zeitiger  ein  und  gibt  Raum  zum \r\nLesen  imd  Schreiben. \r\n\r\nGott  sei  Dank,  wie  mir  alles  wieder  lieb  wird,  was  mir \r\nvon  Jugend  auf  wert  war!  Wie  glücklich  befinde  ich  mich, \r\ndaß  ich  den  alten  Schriftstellern  wieder  näher  zu  treten \r\nwage!  Denn  jetzt  darf  ich  es  sagen,  darf  meine  Krank- \r\nheit und  Torheit  bekennen.  Schon  einige  Jahre  her  dürft' \r\nich  keinen  lateinischen  Autor  ansehen,  nichts  betrachten, \r\nwas  mir  ein  Bild  Italiens  erneute.  Geschah  es  zufällig, \r\nso  erduldete  ich  die  entsetzlichsten  Schmerzen.  Herder \r\nspottete  oft  über  mich,  daß  ich  all  mein  Latein  aus  dem \r\nSpinoza  lerne;  denn  er  hatte  bemerkt,  daß  dies  das  einzige \r\nlateinische  Buch  war,  das  ich  las:  er  wußte  aber  nicht,  wie \r\nsehr  ich  mich  vor  den  Alten  hüten  mußte,  wie  ich  mich  in \r\njene  abstrusen  Allgemeinheiten  nur  ängstlich  flüchtete. \r\nNoch  zuletzt  hat  mich  die  Wielandsche  Übersetzung  der \r\nSatiren  höchst  unglücklich  gemacht:  ich  hatte  kaum  zwei \r\ngelesen,  so  war  ich  schon  verrückt. \r\nHätte  ich  nicht  den  Entschluß  gefaßt,  den  ich  jetzt  aus- \r\nführe, so  war'  ich  rein  zugrunde  gegangen:  zu  einer  sol- \r\nchen Reife  war  die  Begierde,  diese  Gegenstände  mit \r\nAugen  zu  sehen,  in  meinem  Gemüt  gestiegen.  Die  histo- \r\nrische Kenntnis  fördert  mich  nicht:  die  Dinge  standen \r\nnur  eine  Handbreit  von  mir  ab,  aber  durch  eine  undurch- \r\ndringliche Mauer  geschieden.  Es  ist  mir  wirklich  auch \r\njetzt  nicht  etwa  zumute,  als  wenn  ich  die  Sachen  zum \r\nerstenmal  sähe,  sondern  als  ob  ich  sie  wiedersähe.    Ich \r\n\r\n\r\nI04  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nbin  nur  kurze  Zeit  in  Venedig  und  habe  mir  die  hiesige \r\nExistenz  genugsam  zugeeignet  und  weiß,  daß  ich,  wenn \r\nauch  einen  unvollständigen,  doch  einen  ganz  klaren  und \r\nwahren  Begrifi\"  mit  wegnehme. \r\n\r\nVenedig,  den  14.  Oktober,  2  Stundeti  in  der  Nacht. \r\nIn  den  letzten  Augenblicken  meines  Hierseins:  denn  es \r\ngeht  sogleich  mit  dem  Kurierschifte  nach  Ferrara.  Ich \r\nverlasse  Venedig  gern;  denn  um  mit  Vergnügen  und \r\nNutzen  zu  bleiben,  müßte  ich  andere  Schritte  tun,  die \r\naußer  meinem  Plan  liegen;  auch  verläßt  jedermann  nun \r\ndiese  Stadt  und  sucht  seine  Garten  und  Besitzungen \r\nauf  dem  festen  Lande.  Ich  habe  indes  gut  aufgeladen \r\nund  trage  das  reiche,  sonderbare,  einzige  Bild  mit  mir \r\nfort. \r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM \r\nDen  16.  Oktober  früh,  auf  dein  Schiffe. \r\n\r\nMEINE  Reisegesellschaft,  Männer  und  Frauen,  ganz \r\nleidliche  und  natürliche  Menschen,  Hegen  noch  alle \r\nschlafend  in  der  Kajüte.  Ich  aber,  in  meinen  Mantel \r\ngehüllt,  blieb  auf  dem  Verdeck  die  beiden  Nächte.  Nur \r\ngegen  Morgen  ward  es  kühl.  Ich  bin  nun  in  den  fünf- \r\nundvierzigsten Grad  wirklich  eingetreten  und  wiederhole \r\nmein  altes  Lied:  dem  Lande.sbewohner  wollt'  ich  alles \r\nlassen,  wenn  ich  nur,  wie  Dido,  so  viel  Klima  mit  Rie- \r\nmen umspannen  könnte,  um  unsere  Wuhnungen  damit \r\neinzufassen.  Es  ist  denn  doch  ein  ander  Sein.  Die  Fahrt \r\nbei  herrlichem  Wetter  war  sehr  angenehm,  die  Aus-  und \r\nAnsichten  einfach,  aber  anmutig.  Der  Po,  ein  freund- \r\nlicher Fluß,  zieht  hier  durch  große  Plainen,  man  sieht \r\nnur  seine  bebuschten  und  bewaldeten  Ufer,  keine  Fer- \r\nnen. Hier,  wie  an  der  Etsch,  sah  ich  alberne  Wasser- \r\nbaue, die  kindisch  und  schädlich  sind,  wie  die  an  der \r\nSaale. \r\n\r\nFerrara,  den  16.  Oktober  nachts. \r\nSeit  früh  sieben  Uhr  deutschen  Zeigers  hier  angelangt, \r\nbereite    ich    mich,    morgen   wieder   wegzugehen.     Zum \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  105 \r\n\r\nerstenmal  überfällt  mich  eine  Art  von  Unlust,  in  dieser \r\ngroßen  und  schönen,  flachgelegenen,  entvölkerten  Stadt. \r\nDieselben  Straßen  belebte  sonst  ein  glänzender  Hof,  hier \r\nwohnte  Ariost  unzufrieden,  Tasso  unglücklich,  und  wir \r\nglauben  uns  zu  erbauen,  wenn  wir  diese  Stätte  besuchen. \r\nAriosts  Grabmal  enthält  viel  Marmor,  schlecht  ausge- \r\nteilt. Statt  Tassos  Gefängnis  zeigen  sie  einen  Holzstall \r\noder  Kohlengewölbe,  wo  er  gewiß  nicht  aufbewahrt \r\nworden  ist.  Auch  weiß  im  Hause  kaum  jemand  mehr, \r\nwas  man  will.  Endlich  besinnen  sie  sich,  um  des  Trink- \r\ngeldes willen.  Es  kommt  mir  vor  wie  Dr.  Luthers  Tinten- \r\nklecks, den  der  Kastellan  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  wieder  auf- \r\nfrischt. Die  meisten  Reisenden  haben  doch  etwas  Hand- \r\nwerksburschenartiges  und  sehen  sich  gern  nach  solchen \r\nWahrzeichen  um.  Ich  war  ganz  mürrisch  geworden,  so \r\ndaß  ich  an  einem  schönen  akademischen  Institut,  welches \r\nein  aus  Ferrara  gebürtiger  Kardinal  gestiftet  und  berei- \r\nchert, wenig  teilnahm;  doch  erquickten  mich  einige  alte \r\nDenkmale  im  Hofe. \r\n\r\nSodann  erheiterte  mich  der  gute  Einfall  eines  Malers. \r\nJohannes  der  Täufer  vor  Herodes  und  Herodias.  Der \r\nProphet  in  seinem  gewöhnlichen  Wüstenkostüme  deutet \r\nheftig  auf  die  Dame.  Sie  sieht  ganz  gelassen  den  neben \r\nihr  sitzenden  Fürsten  und  der  Fürst  still  und  klug  den \r\nEnthusiasten  an.  Vor  dem  Könige  steht  ein  Hund,  weiß, \r\nmittelgroß;  unter  dem  Rock  der  Herodias  hingegen \r\nkommt  ein  kleiner  Bologneser  hervor,  welche  beide  den \r\nPropheten  anbellen.  Mich  dünkt,  das  ist  recht  glücklich \r\ngedacht. \r\n\r\nCenü\\  den  ly.  Oktober  abends. \r\nIn  einer  bessern  Stimmung  als  gestern  schreibe  ich  aus \r\nGuercins  Vaterstadt.  Es  ist  aber  auch  ein  ganz  anderer \r\nZustand.  Ein  freundliches,  wohlgebautes  Städtchen,  von \r\nohngefähr  fünftausend  Einwohnern,  nahrhaft,  lebendig, \r\nreinlich,  in  einer  unübersehlich  bebauten  Plaine.  Ich  be- \r\nstieg nach  meiner  Gewohnheit  sogleich  den  Turm.  Ein \r\nMeer  von  Pappelspitzen,  zwischen  denen  man  in  der  Nähe \r\nkleine  Bauerhöfchen  erblickt,  jedes  mit  seinem  eignen  Feld \r\n\r\n\r\nio6  ITAIJENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\numgeben.  Köstlicher  Boden,  ein  mildes  Klima.  Es  war  ein \r\nHerbstabend,  wie  wir  unserm  Sommer  selten  einen  ver- \r\ndanken. Der  Himmel,  den  ganzen  Tag  bedeckt,  heiterte \r\nsich  auf,  die  Wolken  warfen  sich  nord-  und  südwärts  an \r\ndie  Gebirge,  und  ich  hoffe  einen  schönen  morgenden \r\nTag. \r\n\r\nHier  sah  ich  die  Apenninen,  denen  ich  mich  nähere,  zum \r\nerstenmal.  Der  Winter  dauert  hier  nur  Dezember  und \r\nJanuar;  ein  regnichter  April,  übrigens  nach  Beschaffen- \r\nheit der  Jahreszeit  gut  Wetter.  Nie  anhaltenden  Regen; \r\ndoch  war  dieser  September  besser  und  wärmer  als  ihr \r\nAugust.  Die  Apenninen  begrüßte  ich  freundlich  in  Süden; \r\ndenn  ich  habe  der  Flächen  bald  genug.  Morgen  schreibe \r\nich  dort  an  ihrem  Fuße. \r\n\r\nGuercino  liebte  seine  Vaterstadt,  wie  überhaupt  die  Ita- \r\nliener diesen  Lokalpatriotismus  im  höchsten  Sinne  hegen \r\nund  pflegen,  aus  welchem  schonen  Gefühl  so  viel  köst- \r\nliche Anstalten,  ja  die  Menge  Ortsheilige  entsprungen \r\nsind.  Unter  jenes  Meisters  Leitung  entstand  nun  hier  eine \r\nMalerakademie.  Er  hinterließ  mehrere  Bilder,  an  denen \r\nsich  noch  der  Bürger  freut,  die  es  aber  auch  wert  sind. \r\nGuercin  ist  ein  heiliger  Name,  und  im  Munde  der  Kinder \r\nwie  der  Allen. \r\n\r\nSehr  lieb  war  mir  das  Bild,  den  auferstandenen  Christus \r\nvorstellend,  der  seiner  Mutter  erscheint.  Vor  ihm  knieend, \r\nblickt  sie  auf  ihn  mit  unbeschreiblicher  Innigkeit.  Ihre \r\nLinke  berührt  seinen  Leib,  gleich  unter  der  unseligen \r\nWunde,  die  das  ganze  Bild  verdirbt.  Er  hat  seine  linke \r\nHand  um  ihren  Hals  gelegt  und  biegt  sich,  um  sie  be- \r\nquemer anzusehen,  ein  wenig  mit  dem  Körper  zurück. \r\nDieses  gibt  der  Figur  etwas,  ich  will  nicht  sagen  Ge- \r\nzwungenes, aber  doch  Fremdes.  Demohngeachtet  bleibt \r\nsie  unendlich  angenehm.  Der  stilltraurige  Blick,  mit  dem \r\ner  sie  ansieht,  ist  einzig,  als  wenn  ihm  die  Erinnerung \r\nseiner  und  ihrer  Leiden,  durch  die  Auferstehung  nicht \r\ngleich  geheilt,  vor  der  edlen  Seele  schwebte. \r\nStrange  hat  das  Bild  gestochen;  ich  wünschte,  daß  meine \r\nFreunde  wenigstens  diese  Kopie  sähen. \r\nDarauf  gewann  eine  Madonna  meine  Neigung.    Das  Kind \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  107 \r\n\r\nverlangt  nach  der  Brust;  sie  zaudert  schamhaft,  den  Busen \r\nzu  entblößen.  Natürlich,  edel,  köstlich  und  schön. \r\nFerner  eine  Maria,  die  dem  vor  ihr  stehenden  und  nach \r\nden  Zuschauern  gerichteten  Kinde  den  Arm  führt,  daß  es \r\nmit  aufgehobenen  Fingern  den  Segen  austeile.  Ein  im \r\nSinn  der  katholischen  Mythologie  sehr  glücklicher  und \r\noft  wiederholter  Gedanke. \r\n\r\nGuercin  ist  ein  innerlich  braver,  männlich  gesunder  Maler, \r\nohne  Roheit.  Vielmehr  haben  seine  Sachen  eine  zarte \r\nmoralische  Grazie,  eine  ruhige  Freiheit  und  Großheit, \r\ndabei  etwas  Eignes,  daß  man  seine  Werke,  wenn  man \r\neinmal  das  Auge  darauf  gebildet  hat,  nicht  verkennen \r\nwird.  Die  Leichtigkeit,  Reinlichkeit  und  Vollendung \r\nseines  Pinsels  setzt  in  Erstaunen.  Er  bedient  sich  be- \r\nsonders schöner,  ins  Braunrote  gebrochener  Farben  zu \r\nseinen  Gewändern;  diese  harmonieren  gar  gut  mit  dem \r\nBlauen,  das  er  auch  gerne  anbringt. \r\nDie  Gegenstände  der  übrigen  Bilder  sind  mehr  oder \r\nweniger  unglücklich.  Der  gute  Künstler  hat  sich  ge- \r\nmartert and  doch  Erfindung  und  Pinsel,  Geist  und  Hand \r\nverschwendet  und  verloren.  Mir  ist  aber  sehr  lieb  und \r\nwert,  daß  ich  auch  diesen  schönen  Kunstkreis  gesehen \r\nhabe,  obgleich  ein  solches  Vorüberrennen  wenig  Genuß \r\nund  Belehrung  gewährt. \r\n\r\nBologna,  den  18.  Oktober  nachts. \r\nHeute  früh,  vor  Tage,  fuhr  ich  von  Cento  weg  und  ge- \r\nlangte bald  genug  hieher.  Ein  flinker  und  wohlunter- \r\nrichteter Lohnbediente,  sobald  er  vernahm,  daß  ich  nicht \r\nlange  zu  verweilen  gedächte,  jagte  mich  durch  alle  Straßen, \r\ndurch  so  viel  Paläste  und  Kirchen,  daß  ich  kaum  in  meinem \r\nVolkmann  anzeichnen  konnte,  wo  ich  gewesen  war;  und \r\nwer  weiß,  ob  ich  mich  künftig  bei  diesen  Merkzeichen \r\naller  der  Sachen  erinnere.  Nun  gedenke  ich  aber  ein \r\npaar  lichter  Punkte,  an  denen  ich  wahrhafte  Beruhigung \r\ngefühlt. \r\n\r\nZuerst  also  die  Cäcilia  von  Raffael!  Es  ist,  was  ich \r\nzum  voraus  wußte,  nun  aber  mit  Augen  sah:  er  hat  eben \r\nimmer  gemacht,  was  andere  zu  machen  wünschten,  und \r\n\r\n\r\nio8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nich  möchte  jetzt  nichts  darüber  sagen,  als  daß  es  von  ihm \r\nist.  Fünf  Heihge  nebeneinander,  die  uns  alle  nichts  an- \r\ngehen, deren  Existenz  aber  so  vollkommen  dasteht,  daß \r\nman  dem  Bilde  eine  Dauer  für  die  Ewigkeit  wünscht, \r\nwenn  man  gleich  zufrieden  ist,  selbst  aufgelöst  zu  werden. \r\nUm  ihn  aber  recht  zu  erkennen,  ihn  recht  zu  schätzen \r\nund  ihn  wieder  auch  nicht  ganz  als  einen  Gott  zu  preisen, \r\nder,  wie  Melchisedek,  ohne  Vater  und  ohne  Mutter  er- \r\nschienen wäre,  muß  man  seine  Vorgänger,  seine  Meister \r\nansehen.  Diese  haben  auf  dem  festen  Boden  der  Wahr- \r\nheit Grund  gefaßt,  sie  haben  die  breiten  Fundamente \r\nemsig,  ja  ängstlich  gelegt  und,  miteinander  wetteifernd, \r\ndie  Pyramide  stufenweis  in  die  Höhe  gebaut,  bis  er  zu- \r\nletzt, von  allen  diesen  Vorteilen  unterstützt,  von  dem \r\nhimmlischen  Genius  erleuchtet,  den  letzten  Stein  des \r\nGipfels  aufsetzte,  über  und  neben  dem  kein  anderer  stehen \r\nkann. \r\n\r\nDas  historische  Interesse  wird  besonders  rege,  wenn  man \r\ndie  Werke  der  altern  Meister  betrachtet.  Francesco \r\nFrancia  ist  ein  gar  respektabler  Künstler,  Peter  von  Peru- \r\ngia ein  so  braver  Mann,  daß  man  sagen  möchte:  eine \r\nehrliche  deutsche  Haut.  Hätte  doch  das  Glück  Albrecht \r\nDürern  tiefer  nach  Italien  geführt!  In  München  habe  ich \r\nein  paar  Stücke  von  ihm  gesehen,  von  unglaublicher \r\nGroßheit.  Der  arme  Mann,  wie  er  sich  in  Venedig  ver- \r\nrechnet und  mit  den  Pfaffen  einen  Akkord  macht,  bei  dem \r\ner  Wochen  und  Monate  verliert!  Wie  er  auf  seiner  nieder- \r\nländischen Reise  gegen  seine  herrlichen  Kunstwerke,  wo- \r\nmit er  sein  Glück  zu  machen  hoft'te,  Papageien  eintauscht \r\nund,  um  das  Trinkgeld  zu  sparen,  die  Domestiken  por- \r\nträtiert, die  ihm  einen  Teller  Früchte  bringen!  Mir  ist  so \r\nein  armer  Narr  von  Künstler  unendlich  rührend,  weil  es \r\nim  Grunde  auch  mein  Schicksal  ist,  nur  daß  ich  mir  ein \r\nklein  wenig  besser  zu  helfen  weiß. \r\nGegen  Abend  rettete  ich  mich  endlich  aus  dieser  alten, \r\nehrwürdigen,  gelehrten  Stadt,  aus  der  Volksmenge,  die  in \r\nden  gewölbten  Lauben,  welche  man  fast  durch  alle  Straßen \r\nverbreitet  sieht,  geschützt  vor  Sonne  und  Witterung,  hin \r\nund    her  wandeln,   gaffen,    kaufen   und   ihre   Geschäfte \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRAR A  BIS  ROM  1 7  S  6  109 \r\n\r\ntreiben  kann.  Ich  bestieg  den  Turm  und  ergötzte  mich \r\nan  der  freien  Luft.  Die  Aussicht  ist  herrlich!  Im  Norden \r\nsieht  man  die  Paduanischen  Berge,  sodann  die  Schwei- \r\nzer, Tiroler,  Friauler  Alpen,  genug,  die  ganze  nördliche \r\nKette,  diesmal  im  Nebel.  Gegen  Westen  ein  unbe- \r\ngrenzter Horizont,  aus  dem  nur  die  Tümie  von  Modena \r\nherausragen.  Gegen  Osten  eine  gleiche  Ebene,  bis  ans \r\nAdriatische  Meer,  welches  man  bei  Sonnenaufgang  ge- \r\nwahr wird.  Gegen  Süden  die  Vorhügel  der  Apenninen, \r\nbis  an  ihre  Gipfel  bepflanzt,  bewachsen,  mit  Kirchen, \r\nPalästen,  Gartenhäusern  besetzt,  wie  die  Vicentinischen \r\nHügel.  Es  war  ein  ganz  reiner  Himmel,  kein  Wölkchen, \r\nnur  am  Horizont  eine  Art  Höherauch.  Der  Türmer  ver- \r\nsicherte, daß  nunmehro  seit  sechs  Jahren  dieser  Nebel \r\nnicht  aus  der  Ferne  komme.  Sonst  habe  er  durch  das \r\nSehrohr  die  Berge  von  Vicenza  mit  ihren  Häusern  und \r\nKapellen  gar  wohl  entdecken  können,  jetzt  bei  den  hellsten \r\nTagen  nur  selten.  Und  dieser  Nebel  lege  sich  denn  vor- \r\nzüglich an  die  nördliche  Kette  und  mache  unser  liebes \r\nVaterland  zum  wahren  Cimmerien.  Der  Mann  ließ  mich \r\nauch  die  gesunde  Lage  und  Luft  der  Stadt  daran  be- \r\nmerken, daß  ihre  Dächer  wie  neu  aussähen  und  kein \r\nZiegel  durch  Feuchtigkeit  und  Moos  angegriffen  sei.  ]\\Ian \r\nmuß  gestehen,  die  Dächer  sind  alle  rein  und  schön;  aber \r\ndie  Güte  der  Ziegeln  mag  auch  etwas  dazu  beitragen, \r\nwenigstens  in  alten  Zeiten  hat  man  solche  in  diesen \r\nGegenden  kostbar  gebrannt. \r\n\r\nDer  hängende  Tiu-m  ist  ein  abscheulicher  Anblick,  und \r\ndoch  höchst  wahrscheinlich,  daß  er  mit  Fleiß  so  gebaut \r\nworden.  Ich  erkläre  mir  diese  Torheit  folgendermaßen. \r\nIn  den  Zeiten  der  städtischen  Unnihen  ward  jedes  große \r\nGebäude  zur  Festung,  aus  der  jede  mächtige  Familie \r\neinen  Turm  erhob.  Nach  und  nach  wurde  dies  zu  einer \r\nLust-  und  Ehrensache,  jeder  wollte  auch  mit  einem  Turm \r\nprangen,  und  als  zuletzt  die  graden  Türme  gar  zu  all- \r\ntäglich waren,  so  baute  man  einen  schiefen.  Auch  haben \r\nArchitekt  und  Besitzer  ihren  Zweck  erreicht:  man  sieht \r\nan  den  vielen  graden  schlanken  Türmen  hin  und  sucht \r\nden  krummen.      Ich  war  nachher  oben  auf  demselben. \r\n\r\n\r\nI  To  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDie  Backsteinschichten  liegen  horizontal.  Mit  gutem  bin- \r\ndendem Kitt  und  eisernen  Ankern  kann  man  schon  tolles \r\nZeug  machen. \r\n\r\nBologna^  deti  ig.  Oktober  abends. \r\nMeinen  Tag  habe  ich  bestmöglichst  angewendet,  um  zu \r\nsehen  und  wieder  zu  sehen;  aber  es  geht  mit  der  Kunst \r\nwie  mit  dem  Leben:  je  weiter  man  hineinkommt,  je  breiter \r\nwird  sie.  An  diesem  Himmel  treten  wieder  neue  Ge- \r\nstirne hervor,  die  ich  nicht  berechnen  kann  und  die  mich \r\nirre  machen:  die  Carracci,  Guido,  Dominichin,  in  einer \r\nspätem  glücklichem  Kunstzeit  entsprungen;  sie  aber  wahr- \r\nhaft zu  genießen,  gehört  Wissen  und  Urteil,  welches  mir \r\nabgeht  und  nur  nach  und  nach  erworben  werden  kann. \r\nEin  großes  Hindernis  der  reinen  Betrachtung  und  der  un- \r\nmittelbaren Einsicht  sind  die  meist  unsinnigen  Gegen- \r\nstände der  Bilder,  über  die  man  toll  wird,  indem  man  sie \r\nverehren  und  lieben  möchte. \r\n\r\nEs  ist,  als  da  sich  die  Kinder  Gottes  mit  den  Töchtern \r\nder  Menschen  vermälilten:  daraus  entstanden  mancherlei \r\nUngeheuer.  Indem  der  himmlische  Sinn  des  Guido,  sein \r\nPinsel,  der  nur  das  Vollkommenste,  was  geschaut  werden \r\nkann,  hätte  malen  sollen,  dich  anzieht,  so  möchtest  du \r\ngleich  die  Augen  von  den  abscheulich  dummen,  mit \r\nkeinen  Scheltworten  der  Welt  genug  zu  erniedrigenden \r\nGegenständen  wegkehren,  und  so  geht  es  durchaus:  man \r\nist  immer  auf  der  Anatomie,  dem  Rabensteine,  dem  Schind- \r\nanger, immer  Leiden  des  Helden,  niemals  Handlung,  nie \r\nein  gegenwärtig  Interesse,  immer  etwas  phantastisch  von \r\naußen  Erwartetes.  Entweder  Missetäter,  oder  Verzückte, \r\nVerbrecher  oder  Narren,  wo  denn  der  Maler,  um  sich  zu \r\nretten,  einen  nackten  Kerl,  eine  hübsche  Zuschauerin \r\nherbeischleppt,  allenfalls  seine  geistlichen  Helden  als \r\nGliedermänner  traktiert  und  ihnen  recht  schöne  Falten- \r\nmäntel überwirft.  Da  ist  nichts,  was  einen  menschlichen \r\nBegriff  gäbe!  Unter  zehn  Sujets  nicht  eins,  das  man  hätte \r\nmalen  sollen,  und  das  eine  hat  der  Künstler  nicht  von \r\nder  rechten  Seite  nehmen  dürfen. \r\nDas  große  Bild  von  Guido  in  der  Kirche  der  Mendicanti \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  1 1 1 \r\n\r\nist  alles,  was  man  malen,  aber  auch  alles,  was  man  Un- \r\nsinniges bestellen  und  dem  Künstler  zumuten  kann.  Es \r\nist  ein  Votivbild.  Ich  glaube,  der  ganze  Senat  hat  es \r\ngelobt  und  auch  erfunden.  Die  beiden  Engel,  die  wert \r\nwären,  eine  Psyche  in  ihrem  Unglück  zu  trösten,  müssen \r\nhier — \r\n\r\nDer  heilige  Proclus,  eine  schöne  Figur;  aber  dann  die \r\nandern,  Bischöfe  und  Pfaffen!  Unten  sind  himmlische \r\nKinder,  die  mit  Attributen  spielen.  Der  Maler,  dem  das \r\nMesser  an  der  Kehle  saß,  suchte  sich  zu  helfen,  wie  er \r\nkonnte,  er  mühte  sich  ab,  nur  um  zu  zeigen,  daß  nicht  er \r\nder  Barbar  sei. \r\n\r\nZwei  nackte  Figuren  von  Guido:  ein  Johannes  in  der \r\nWüste,  ein  Sebastian,  wie  köstlich  gemalt!  und  was  sagen \r\nsie?  der  eine  sperrt  das  Maul  auf,  und  der  andere  krümmt \r\nsich. \r\n\r\nBetrachte  ich  in  diesem  Unmut  die  Geschichte,  so  möchte \r\nich  sagen:  der  Glaube  hat  die  Künste  wieder  hervorge- \r\nhoben, der  Aberglaube  hingegen  ist  Herr  über  sie  ge- \r\nworden und  hat  sie  abermals  zugrunde  gerichtet. \r\nNach  Tische  etwas  milder  und  weniger  anmaßlich  ge- \r\nstimmt als  heute  früh,  bemerkte  ich  folgendes  in  meine \r\nSchreibtafel:  Im  Palast  Tanari  ist  ein  berühmtes  Bild  von \r\nGuido,  die  säugende  Maria  vorstellend,  über  Lebens- \r\ngröße, der  Kopf,  als  wenn  ihn  ein  Gott  gemalt  hätte; \r\nunbeschreiblich  ist  der  Ausdruck,  mit  welchem  sie  auf \r\nden  säugenden  Knaben  heruntersieht.  Mir  scheint  es  eine \r\nstille,  tiefe  Duldung,  nicht  als  wenn  sie  ein  Kind  der \r\nLiebe  und  Freude,  sondern  ein  untergeschobenes  himm- \r\nlisches Wechselkind  nur  so  an  sich  zehren  ließe,  weil  es \r\nnun  einmal  nicht  anders  ist  und  sie  in  tiefster  Demut  gar \r\nnicht  begreift,  wie  sie  dazu  kommt.  Der  übrige  Raum  ist \r\ndurch  ein  ungeheures  Gewand  ausgefüllt,  welches  die \r\nKenner  höchlich  preisen;  ich  wußte  nicht  recht,  was  ich \r\ndaraus  machen  sollte.  Auch  sind  die  Farben  dunkler \r\ngeworden;  das  Zimmer  und  der  Tag  waren  nicht  die \r\nhellsten. \r\n\r\nOhnerachtet  der  Verwirrung,  in  der  ich  mich  befinde,  fühle \r\nich  doch  schon,  daß  Übung,  Bekanntschaft  und  Neigung \r\n\r\n\r\n1 1 2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nmir  schon  in  diesen  Irrgärten  zu  Hülfe  kommen.  So  sprach \r\nmich  eine  Beschneidung  von  Guercin  mächtig  an,  weil \r\nich  den  Mann  schon  kenne  und  liebe.  Ich  verzieh  den \r\nunleidlichen  Gegenstand  und  freute  mich  an  der  Aus- \r\nführung.— Gemalt,  was  man  sich  denken  kann;  alles  daran \r\nrespektabel  und  vollendet,  als  wenn's  Emaille  war'. \r\nUnd  so  geht  mir's  denn  wie  Bileam,  dem  konfusen  Pro- \r\npheten, welcher  segnete,  da  er  zu  fluchen  gedachte,  und \r\ndies  würde  noch  öfter  der  Fall  sein,  wenn  ich  länger  ver- \r\nweilte. \r\n\r\nTrifft  man  denn  gar  wieder  einmal  auf  eine  Arbeit  von \r\nRaffael,  oder  die  ihm  wenigstens  mit  einiger  Wahr- \r\nscheinlichkeit zugeschrieben  wird,  so  ist  man  gleich  voll- \r\nkommen geheilt  und  froh.  So  habe  ich  eine  heilige \r\nAgatha  gefunden,  ein  kostbares,  obgleich  nicht  ganz  wohl \r\nerhaltenes  Bild.  Der  Künstler  hat  ihr  eine  gesunde,  sichere \r\nJungfräulichkeit  gegeben,  doch  ohne  Kälte  und  Roheit. \r\nIch  habe  mir  die  Gestalt  wohl  gemerkt  und  werde  ihr  im \r\nGeist  meine  Iphigenie  vorlesen  und  meine  Heldin  nichts \r\nsagen  lassen,  was  diese  Heilige  nicht  aussprechen \r\nmöchte. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  nun  wieder  einmal  dieser  süßen  Bürde  gedenke, \r\ndie  ich  auf  meiner  Wanderung  mit  mir  führe,  so  kann \r\nich  nicht  verschweigen,  daß  zu  den  großen  Kunst-  und \r\nNaturgegenständen,  durch  die  ich  mich  diu-charbeiten \r\nmuß,  noch  eine  wundersame  Folge  von  poetischen  Ge- \r\nstalten hindurchzieht,  die  mich  beunruhigen.  Von  Cento \r\nherüber  wollte  ich  meine  Arbeit  an  Iphigenia  fortsetzen, \r\naber  was  geschah!  Der  Geist  führte  mir  das  Argument \r\nder  Iphigenia  von  Delphi  vor  die  Seele,  und  ich  mußte \r\nes  ausbilden.  So  kurz  als  möglich  sei  es  hier  verzeichnet. \r\nElcktra,  in  gewisser  Hoffnung,  daß  Orest  das  Bild  der \r\ntaurischen  Diana  nach  Delphi  bringen  werde,  erscheint \r\nin  dem  Tempel  des  Apoll  und  widmet  die  grausame  A.\\t, \r\ndie  so  viel  Unheil  in  Pelops'  Hause  angerichtet,  als \r\nschließliches  Sühnopfer  dem  Gotte.  Zu  ihr  tritt,  leider, \r\neiner  der  Griechen  und  erzählt,  wie  er  Orest  und  Pylades \r\nnach  Tauris  begleitet,  die  beiden  Freunde  zum  Tode  füh- \r\nren sehen  und  sich  glücklich  gerettet.    Die  leidenschaft- \r\n\r\n\r\nFERR ÄRA  BIS  ROM  1786  113 \r\n\r\nliehe  Elektra  kennt  sich  selbst  nicht  und  weiß  nicht,  ob  sie \r\ngegen  Götter  oder  Menschen  ihre  Wut  richten  soll. \r\nIndessen  sind  Iphigenie,  Orest  und  Pylades  gleichfalls  zu \r\nDelphi  angekommen.  Iphigeniens  heilige  Ruhe  kontra- \r\nstiert gar  merkwürdig  mitElektrens  irdischer  Leidenschaft, \r\nals  die  beiden  Gestalten,  wechselseitig  unerkannt,  zu- \r\nsammentreffen. Der  entflohene  Grieche  erblickt  Iphi- \r\ngenien,  erkennt  die  Priesterin,  welche  die  Freunde  geopfert, \r\nund  entdeckt  es  Elektren.  Diese  ist  im  Begriff,  mit  dem- \r\nselbigenBeil,  welches  sie  dem  Altar  wieder  entreißt,  Iphi- \r\ngenien  zu  ermorden,  als  eine  glückliche  Wendung  dieses \r\nletzte  schreckliche  Übel  von  den  Geschwistern  abwendet. \r\nWenn  diese  Szene  gelingt,  so  ist  nicht  leicht  etwas  Größeres \r\nund  Rührenderes  auf  dem  Theater  gesehen  worden.  Wo \r\nsoll  man  aber  Hände  und  Zeit  hernehmen,  wenn  auch \r\nder  Geist  willig  wäre! \r\n\r\nIndem  ich  mich  nun  in  dem  Drang  einer  solchen  Über- \r\nfüllung des  Guten  und  Wünschenswerten  geängstigt  fühle, \r\nso  muß  ich  meine  Freunde  an  einen  Traum  erinnern,  der \r\nmir,  es  wird  eben  ein  Jahr  sein,  bedeutend  genug  schien. \r\nEs  träumte  mir  nämlich:  ich  landete  mit  einem  ziemlich \r\ngroßen  Kahn  an  einer  fruchtbaren,  reich  bewachsenen \r\nInsel,  von  der  mir  bewußt  war,  daß  daselbst  die  schön- \r\nsten Fasanen  zu  haben  seien.  Auch  handelte  ich  sogleich \r\nmit  den  Einwohnern  um  solches  Gefieder,  welches  sie \r\nauch  sogleich  häufig,  getötet,  herbeibrachten.  Es  waren \r\nwohl  Fasanen,  wie  aber  der  Traum  alles  umzubilden \r\npflegt,  so  erblickte  man  lange,  farbig  beäugte  Schweife, \r\nwie  von  Pfauen  oder  seltenen  Paradiesvögeln.  Diese \r\nbrachte  man  mir  schockweise  ins  Schifl^,  legte  sie  mit  den \r\nKöpfen  nach  innen,  so  zierlich  gehäuft,  daß  die  langen \r\nbunten  Federschweife,  nach  außen  hängend,  im  Sonnen- \r\nglanz den  herrlichsten  Schober  bildeten,  den  man  sich \r\ndenken  kann,  und  zwar  so  reich,  daß  für  den  Steuernden \r\nund  die  Rudernden  kaum  hinten  und  vom  geringe  Räume \r\nverblieben.  So  durchschnitten  wir  die  ruhige  Flut,  und \r\nich  nannte  mir  indessen  schon  die  Freunde,  denen  ich \r\nvon  diesen  bunten  Schätzen  mitteilen  wollte.  Zuletzt  in \r\neinem  großen  Hafen  landend,  verlor  ich  mich  zwischen \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  8 \r\n\r\n\r\n1 1 4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nungeheuer  bemasteten  Schiffen,  wo  ich  von  Verdeck  auf \r\nVerdeck  stieg,  um  meinem  kleinen  Kahn  einen  sichern \r\nLandungsplatz  zu  suchen. \r\n\r\nAn  solchen  Wahnbildern  ergötzen  wir  uns,  die,  weil  sie \r\naus  uns  selbst  entspringen,  wohl  Analogie  mit  unserm \r\nübrigen  Leben  und  Schicksalen  haben  müssen. \r\n\r\nNun  war  ich  auch  in  der  berühmten  wissenschaftlichen \r\nAnstalt,  das  Institut  oder  die  Studien  genannt.  Das \r\ngroße  Gebäude,  besonders  der  innere  Hof,  sieht  ernst- \r\nhaft genug  aus,  obgleich  nicht  von  der  besten  Baukunst. \r\nAuf  den  Treppen  und  Korridors  fehlt  es  nicht  an  Stukko- \r\nund  Freskozierden;  alles  ist  anständig  und  würdig,  und \r\nüber  die  mannigfaltigen  schönen  und  wissenswerten  Dinge, \r\ndie  hier  zusammengebracht  worden,  erstaunt  man  billig, \r\ndoch  will  es  einem  rj)eutschen  dabei  nicht  wohl  zumute \r\nwerden,  der  eine  freiere  Studienweise  gewohnt  ist. \r\nMir  fiel  eine  frühere  Bemerkung  hier  wieder  in  die  Ge- \r\ndanken, daß  sich  der  Mensch  im  Gange  der  alles  ver- \r\nändernden Zeit  so  schwer  los  macht  von  dem,  was  eine \r\nSache  zuerst  gewesen,  wenn  ihre  Bestimmung  in  der \r\nFolge  sich  auch  verändert.  Die  christlichen  Kirchen  hal- \r\nten noch  immer  an  der  BasiHkenform,  wenngleich  die \r\nTempelgestalt  vielleicht  dem  Kultus  vorteilhafter  wäre. \r\nWissenschaftliche  Anstalten  haben  noch  das  klösterliche \r\nAnsehn,  weil  in  solchen  frommen  Bezirken  die  Studien \r\nzuerst  Raum  und  Ruhe  gewannen.  Die  Gerichtssäle  der \r\nItaliener  sind  so  weit  und  hoch,  als  das  Vermögen  einer \r\nGemeinde  zureicht;  man  glaubt  auf  dem  Marktplatze \r\nunter  freiem  Himmel  zu  sein,  wo  sonst  Recht  gesprochen \r\nwurde.  Und  l)auen  wir  nicht  noch  immer  die  größten \r\nTheater  mit  allem  Zubehör  unter  ein  Dach,  als  wenn  es \r\ndie  erste  Meßbude  wäre,  die  man  auf  kurze  Zeit  von \r\nBrettern  zusammenschlug?  Durch  den  Ungeheuern  Zu- \r\ndrang  der  Wißbegierigen  um  die  Zeit  der  Reformation \r\nwurden  die  Schüler  in  Bürgerhäuser  getrieben;  aber  wie \r\nlange  hat  es  nicht  gedauert,  bis  wir  unsere  Waisenhäuser \r\nauftaten  und  den  armen  Kindern  diese  so  notwendige \r\nWelterziehung  verschafften. \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  115 \r\n\r\nBologna,  den  20.  Oktober  abends. \r\n\r\nDiesen  heitern  schönen  Tag  habe  ich  ganz  unter  freiem \r\nHimmel  zugebracht.  Kaum  nahe  ich  mich  den  Bergen, \r\nso  werde  ich  schon  wieder  vom  Gestein  angezogen.  Ich \r\nkomme  mir  vor  wie  Antäus,  der  sich  immer  neu  gestärkt \r\nfühlt,  je  kräftiger  man  ihn  mit  seiner  Mutter  Erde  in  Be- \r\nrührung bringt. \r\n\r\nIch  ritt  nach  Paderno,  wo  der  sogenannte  Bologneser \r\nSchwerspat  gefunden  wird,  woraus  man  die  kleinen  Kuchen \r\nbereitet,  welche  kalziniert  im  Dunkeln  leuchten,  wenn \r\nsie  vorher  dem  Lichte  ausgesetzt  gewesen,  und  die  man \r\nhier  kurz  und  gut  Fosfori  nennt. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Wege  fand  ich  schon  ganze  Felsen  Fraueneis \r\nzu  Tage  anstehend,  nachdem  ich  ein  sandiges  Tonge- \r\nbirg  hinter  mir  gelassen  hatte.  Bei  einer  Ziegelhütte  geht \r\nein  Wasserriß  hinunter,  in  welchen  sich  viele  kleinere \r\nergießen.  Man  glaubt  zuerst  einen  aufgeschwemmten \r\nLehmhügel  zu  sehen,  der  vom  Regen  ausgewaschen  wäre, \r\ndoch  konnte  ich  bei  näherer  Betrachtung  von  seiner  Natur \r\nso  viel  entdecken.  Das  feste  Gestein,  woraus  dieser  Teil \r\ndes  Gebirges  besteht,  ist  ein  sehr  feinblättriger  Schiefer- \r\nton, welcher  mit  Gips  abwechselt.  Das  schiefrige  Gestein \r\nist  so  innig  mit  Schwefelkies  gemischt,  daß  es,  von  Luft \r\nund  Feuchtigkeit  berührt,  sich  ganz  und  gar  verändert: \r\nes  schwillt  auf,  die  Lagen  verlieren  sich,  es  entsteht  eine \r\nArt  Letten,  muschlig,  zerbröckelt,  auf  den  Flächen  glän- \r\nzend, wie  Steinkohlen.  Nur  an  großen  Stücken,  deren \r\nich  mehrere  zerschlug  und  beide  Gestalten  deutlich  wahr- \r\nnahm, konnte  man  sich  von  dem  Übergange,  von  der \r\nUmbildung  überzeugen.  Zugleichsieht  man  die  muschligen \r\nFlächen  mit  weißen  Punkten  beschlagen,  manchmal  sind \r\ngelbe  Partien  drin;  so  zerfällt  nach  und  nach  die  ganze \r\nOberfläche,  und  der  Hügel  sieht  wie  ein  verwitterter \r\nSchwefelkies  im  großen  aus.  Es  finden  sich  unter  den \r\nLagen  auch  härtere,  grüne  und  rote.  Schwefelkies  hab' \r\nich  in  dem  Gestein  auch  öfters  angeflogen  gefunden. \r\nNun  stieg  ich  in  den  Schluchten  des  bröcklig  aufgelösten \r\nGebirgs  hinauf,    wie    sie  von  den  letzten  Regengüssen \r\n\r\n\r\n1 1 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ndurchwaschen  waren,  und  fand  zu  meiner  Freude  den \r\ngesuchten  Schwerspat  häufig,  meist  in  unvollkommener \r\nEiform,  an  mehreren  Stellen  des  eben  zerfallenden  Ge- \r\nbirgs  hervorschauen,  teils  ziemlich  rein,  teils  noch  von \r\ndem  Ton,  in  welchem  er  stak,  genau  umgeben.  Daß  es \r\nkeine  Geschiebe  seien,  davon  kann  man  sich  beim  ersten \r\nAnblick  überzeugen.  Ob  sie  gleichzeitig  mit  der  Schiefer- \r\ntonlage, oder  ob  sie  erst  bei  Aufblähung  oder  Zersetzung \r\nderselben  entstanden,  verdient  eine  nähere  Untersuchung. \r\nDie  von  mir  gefundenen  Stücke  nähern  sich,  größer  oder \r\nkleiner,  einer  unvollkommenen  Eigestalt;  die  kleinsten \r\ngehen  auch  wohl  in  eine  undeutliche  Kristallform  über. \r\nDas  schwerste  Stück,  welches  ich  gefunden,  wiegt  sieb- \r\nzehn Lot.  Auch  fand  ich  in  demselbigen  Ton  lose,  voll- \r\nkommene Gipskristalle.  Nähere  Bestimmung  werden \r\nKenner  an  den  Stücken,  die  ich  mitbringe,  zu  entwickeln \r\nwissen.  Und  ich  wäre  nun  also  schon  wieder  mit  Steinen \r\nbelastet!  Ein  Achtelszentner  dieses  Schwerspats  habe \r\nich  aufgepackt. \r\n\r\nIn  der  N'ac/it. \r\nWie  viel  hätte  ich  noch  zu  sagen,  wenn  ich  alles  gestehen \r\nwollte,  was  mir  an  diesem  schönen  Tage  durch  den  Kopf \r\ngingf.     Aber  mein  Verlangen  ist  stärker  als  meine  Ge- \r\n\r\nDO  ö \r\n\r\ndanken.  Ich  fühle  mich  unwiderstehlich  vorwärts  ge- \r\nzogen, nur  mit  Mühe  sammle  ich  mich  an  dem  Gegen- \r\nwärtigen. Und  es  scheint,  der  Himmel  erhört  mich.  Es \r\nmeldet  sich  ein  Vetturin  grade  nach  Rom,  und  so  werde \r\nich  übermorgen  unaufhaltsam  dorthin  abgehen.  Da  muß \r\nich  denn  wohl  heute  und  morgen  nach  meinen  Sachen \r\nsehn,  manches  besorgen  und  wegarbeiten. \r\n\r\nLojano  auf  den  Apenninen,  den  21.  Oktober  abends. \r\nOb  ich  mich  heute  selbst  aus  Bologna  getrieben  oder  ob \r\nich  daraus  gejagt  worden,  wüßte  ich  nicht  zu  sagen. \r\nGenug,  ich  ergrift\"  mit  Leidenschaft  einen  schnellern \r\nAnlaß,  abzureisen.  Nun  bin  ich  hier  in  einem  elenden \r\nWirtshause,  in  Gesellschaft  eines  päpstlichen  Offiziers, \r\nder  nach  Perugia,  seiner  Vaterstadt,  geht.     Als  ich  mich \r\n\r\n\r\nFERR ÄRA  BIS  ROM  1786  117 \r\n\r\nzu  ihm  in  den  zweirädrigen  Wagen  setzte,  machte  ich  ihm, \r\num  etwas  zu  reden,  das  Kompliment,  daß  ich  als  ein \r\nDeutscher,  der  gewohnt  sei,  mit  Soldaten  umzugehen, \r\nsehr  angenehm  finde,  nun  mit  einem  päpstlichen  Offizier \r\nin  Gesellschaft  zu  reisen. \r\n\r\nNehmt  mir  nicht  übel,  versetzte  er  darauf,  Ihr  könnt \r\nwohl  eine  Neigung  zum  Soldatenstande  haben:  denn  ich \r\nhöre,  in  Deutschland  ist  alles  Militär;  aber  was  mich \r\nbetrifft,  obgleich  unser  Dienst  sehr  läßlich  ist  und  ich  in \r\nBologna,  wo  ich  in  Garnison  stehe,  meiner  Bequemlich- \r\nkeit vollkommen  pflegen  kann,  so  wollte  ich  doch,  daß \r\nich  diese  Jacke  los  wäre  und  das  Gütchen  meines  Vaters \r\nverwaltete.  Ich  bin  aber  der  jüngere  Sohn,  und  so  muß \r\nich  mir's  gefallen  lassen. \r\n\r\nDen  23.  Oktober  abends. \r\nGiredo,  auch  ein  kleines  Nest  auf  den  Apenninen,  wo \r\nich  mich  recht  glücklich  fühle,  meinen  Wünschen  ent- \r\ngegenreisend. Heute  gesellten  sich,  reitend,  ein  Herr  und \r\neine  Dame  zu  uns,  ein  Engländer  mit  einer  sogenannten \r\nSchwester.  Ihre  Pferde  sind  schön,  sie  reisen  aber  ohne \r\nBedienung,  und  der  Herr  macht,  wie  es  scheint,  zugleich \r\nden  Reitknecht  und  den  Kammerdiener.  Sie  finden  über- \r\nall zu  klagen;  man  glaubt  einige  Blätter  im  Archenholtz \r\nzu  lesen. \r\n\r\nDie  Apenninen  sind  mir  ein  merkwürdiges  Stück  Welt. \r\nAuf  die  große  Fläche  der  Regionen  des  Pos  folgt  ein \r\nGebirg,  das  sich  aus  der  Tiefe  erhebt,  um  zwischen  zwei \r\nMeeren  südwärts  das  feste  Land  zu  endigen.  Wäre  die \r\nGebirgsart  nicht  zu  steil,  zu  hoch  über  der  Meeresfläche, \r\nnicht  so  sonderbar  verschlungen,  daß  Ebbe  und  Flut  vor \r\naltenZeiten  mehr  und  länger  hätten  hereinwirken,  größere \r\nFlächen  bilden  und  überspülen  können,  so  wäre  es  eins \r\nder  schönsten  Länder  in  dem  herrlichsten  Klima,  etwas \r\nhöher  als  das  andere  Land.  So  aber  ist's  ein  seltsam \r\nGewebe  von  Bergrücken  gegeneinander;  oft  sieht  man \r\ngar  nicht  ab,  wohin  das  Wasser  seinen  Ablauf  nehmen \r\nwill.  Wären  die  Täler  besser  ausgefüllt,  die  Flächen  mehr \r\nglatt  und  überspült,  so  könnte  man  das  Land  mit  Böhmen \r\n\r\n\r\n1 1 8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nvergleichen,  nur  daß  die  Berge  auf  alle  Weise  einen \r\nandern  Charakter  haben.  Doch  muß  man  sich  keine \r\nBergwüste,  sondern  ein  meist  bebautes,  obgleich  ge- \r\nbirgiges Land  vorstellen.  Kastanien  kommen  hier  sehr \r\nschön^  der  Weizen  ist  trett'lich  und  die  Saat  schon  hübsch \r\ngrün.  Immergrüne  Eichen  mit  kleinen  Blättern  stehen \r\nam  Wege,  um  die  Kirchen  und  Kapellen  aber  schlanke \r\nZypressen. \r\n\r\nGestern  abend  war  das  Wetter  trübe,  heute  ist's  wieder \r\nhell  und  schön. \r\n\r\nDen  25.  Oktober  abends.  Perugia. \r\nZwei  Abende  habe  ich  nicht  geschrieben.  Die  Herbergen \r\nwaren  so  schlecht,  daß  an  kein  Auslegen  eines  Blattes \r\nzu  denken  war.  Auch  fängt  es  mir  an  ein  bißchen  ver- \r\nworren zu  werden:  denn  seit  der  Abreise  von  Vene- \r\ndig spinnt  sich  der  Reiserocken  nicht  so  schön  und  glatt \r\nmehr  ab. \r\n\r\nDen  23.  früh,  unserer  Uhr  um  zehne,  kamen  wir  aus  den \r\nApenninen  hervor  und  sahen  Florenz  liegen,  in  einem \r\nweiten  Tal,  das  unglaublich  bebaut  und  ins  Unendliche \r\nmit  Villen  und  Häusern  besät  ist. \r\n\r\nDie  Stadt  hatte  ich  eiligst  diu-chlaufen,  den  Dom,  das \r\nBaptisterium.  Hier  tut  sich  wieder  eine  ganz  neue,  mir \r\nunbekannte  Welt  auf,  an  der  ich  nicht  verweilen  Avill. \r\nDer  Garten  Boboli  liegt  köstlich.  Ich  eilte  so  schnell \r\nheraus  als  hinein. \r\n\r\nDer  Stadt  sieht  man  den  Volksreichtum  an,  der  sie  er- \r\nbaut hat;  man  erkennt,  daß  sie  sich  einer  Folge  von \r\nglücklichen  Regierungen  erfreute.  Überhaupt  fällt  es  auf, \r\nwas  in  Toskana  gleich  die  öfüentlichen  Werke,  Wege,- \r\nBrücken  für  ein  schönes,  grandioses  Ansehen  haben.  Es \r\nist  hier  alles  zugleich  tüchtig  und  reinlich,  Gebrauch  und \r\nNutzen  mit  Anmut  sind  beabsichtigt,  überall  läßt  sich \r\neine  belebende  Sorgfalt  bemerken.  Der  Staat  des  Papstes \r\nhingegen  scheint  sich  nur  zu  erhalten,  weil  ihn  die  Erde \r\nnicht  verschlingen  will. \r\n\r\nWenn  ich  neulich  von  den  Apenninen  sagte,  was  sie  sein \r\nkönnten,  das  ist  nun  Toskana:   weil  es  so  viel  tiefer  lag, \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRAR A  BIS  ROM  1786  119 \r\n\r\nso  hat  das  alte  Meer  recht  seine  Schuldigkeit  getan  und \r\ntiefen  Lehmboden  aufgehäuft.  Er  ist  hellgelb  und  leicht \r\nzu  verarbeiten.  Sie  pflügen  tief,  aber  noch  recht  auf  die \r\nursprüngliche  Art:  ihr  Pflug  hat  keine  Räder,  und  die \r\nPflugschar  ist  nicht  beweglich.  So  schleppt  sie  der  Bauer, \r\nhinter  seinen  Ochsen  gebückt,  einher  und  wühlt  die  Erde \r\nauf.  Es  wird  bis  fünfmal  gepflügt;  wenigen  und  nur  sehr \r\nleichten  Dünger  streuen  sie  mit  den  Händen.  Endlich  säen \r\nsie  den  Weizen,  dann  häufen  sie  schmale  Sottein  auf; \r\ndazwischen  entstehen  tiefe  Furchen,  alle  so  gerichtet,  daß \r\ndas  Regenwasser  ablaufen  muß.  Die  Frucht  wächst  nun \r\nauf  den  Sottein  in  die  Höhe;  in  den  Furchen  gehen  sie \r\nhin  und  her,  wenn  sie  jäten.  Diese  Verfahrungsart  ist \r\nbegreiflich,  wo  Nässe  zu  fürchten  ist;  warum  sie  es  aber \r\nauf  den  schönsten  Gebreiten  tun,  kann  ich  nicht  ein- \r\nsehen. Diese  Betrachtung  machte  ich  bei  Arezzo,  wo  sich \r\neine  herrliche  Plaine  auftut.  Reiner  kann  man  kein  Feld \r\nsehen,  nirgends  auch  nur  eine  Erdscholle,  alles  klar  wie \r\ngesiebt.  Der  Weizen  gedeiht  hier  recht  schön,  und  er \r\nscheint  hier  alle  seiner  Natur  gemäßen  Bedingimgen  zu \r\nfinden.  Das  zweite  Jahr  bauen  sie  Bohnen  für  die  Pferde, \r\ndie  hier  keinen  Hafer  bekommen.  Es  werden  auch  Lu- \r\npinen gesäet,  die  jetzt  schon  vortrefflich  grün  stehen  und \r\nim  INIärz  Früchte  bringen.  Auch  der  Lein  hat  schon  ge- \r\nkeimt; er  bleibt  den  Winter  über  und  wird  durch  den \r\nFrost  nur  dauerhafter. \r\n\r\nDie  Ölbäume  sind  wunderliche  Pflanzen;  sie  sehen  fast \r\nwie  Weiden,  verlieren  auch  den  Kern,  und  die  Rinde \r\nklafft  auseinander.  Aber  sie  haben  demohngeachtet  ein \r\nfesteres  Ansehn.  Man  sieht  auch  dem  Holze  an,  daß \r\nes  langsam  wächst  und  sich  unsäglich  fein  organisiert. \r\nDas  Blatt  ist  weidenartig,  nur  weniger  Blätter  am  Zweige. \r\nUm  Florenz,  an  den  Bergen,  ist  alles  mit  Ölbäumen  und \r\nWeinstöcken  bepflanzt;  dazwischen  wird  das  Erdreich  zu \r\nKörnern  benutzt.  Bei  Arezzo  und  so  weiter  läßt  man \r\ndie  Felder  freier.  Ich  finde,  daß  man  den  Efeu  nicht \r\ngenug  abwehrt,  der  den  Ölbäumen  und  andern  schädlich \r\nist,  da  es  so  ein  leichtes  wäre,  ihn  zu  zerstören.  Wiesen \r\nsieht  man  gar  nicht.  Man  sagt,  das  türkische  Korn  zehre \r\n\r\n\r\nI20  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nden  Boden  aus;  seitdem  es  eingeführt  worden,  habe  der \r\nAckerbau  in  anderm  Betracht  verloren.  Ich  glaube  es \r\nwohl,  bei  dem  geringen  Dünger. \r\n\r\nHeute  abend  habe  ich  von  meinem  Hauptmann  Abschied \r\ngenommen,  mit  dem  Versprechen,  ihn  auf  meiner  Rück- \r\nreise in  Bologna  zu  besuchen.  Er  ist  ein  wahrer  Reprä- \r\nsentant vieler  seiner  Landsleute.  Hier  einiges,  das  ihn \r\nbesonders  bezeichnet.  Da  ich  oft  still  und  nachdenklich \r\nwar,  sagte  er  einmal:  Che  pensa!  non  deve  mai  pensar \r\nl'uomo,  pensando  s'invecchia.  Das  ist  verdolmetscht: \r\nWas  denkt  Ihr  viel!  der  Mensch  muß  niemals  denken, \r\ndenkend  altert  man  nur.  Und  nach  einigem  Gespräch: \r\nNon  deve  fermarsi  l'uomo  in  una  sola  cosa,  perche  allora \r\ndivien  matto;  bisogna  aver  mille  cose,  una  confusione \r\nnella  testa.  Auf  deutsch:  Der  Mensch  muß  sich  nicht \r\nauf  eine  einzige  Sache  heften,  denn  da  wird  er  toll;  man \r\nmuß  tausend  Sachen,  eine  Konfusion  im  Kopfe  haben. \r\nDer  gute  Mann  konnte  freilich  nicht  wissen,  daß  ich \r\neben  darum  still  und  nachdenkend  war,  weil  eine  Kon- \r\nfusion von  alten  und  neuen  Gegenständen  mir  den  Kopf \r\nverwirrte.  Die  Bildung  eines  solchen  Italieners  wird  man \r\nnoch  klarer  aus  folgendem  erkennen.  Da  er  wohl  merkte, \r\ndaß  ich  Protestant  sei,  sagte  er  nach  einigem  Umschweif, \r\nich  möchte  ihm  doch  gewisse  Fragen  erlauben,  denn  er \r\nhabe  so  viel  Wunderliches  von  uns  Protestanten  gehört, \r\nworüber  er  endlich  einmal  Gewißheit  zu  haben  wünsche. \r\nDürft  ihr  denn,  so  fragte  er,  mit  einem  hübschen  Mäd- \r\nchen auf  einem  guten  Fuß  leben,  ohne  mit  ihr  grade  ver- \r\nheiratet zu  sein?  erlauben  euch  das  eure  Priester? — Icli \r\nerwiderte  darauf:  Unsere  Priester  sind  kluge  Leute,  welche \r\nvon  solchen  Kleinigkeiten  keine  Notiz  nehmen.  Freilich, \r\nwenn  wir  sie  darum  fragen  wollten,  so  würden  sie  es  uns \r\nnicht  erlauben. — Ihr  braucht  sie  also  nicht  zu  fragen? \r\nrief  er  aus.  O  ihr  Glücklichen!  und  da  ihr  ihnen  nicht \r\nbeichtet,  so  erfahren  sie's  nicht.  Hierauf  erging  er  sich \r\nin  Schelten  und  Mißbilligen  seiner  Pfaften  und  in  dem \r\nPreise  unserer  seligen  Freiheit.  Was  jedoch  die  Beichte \r\nbetrifft,  fuhr  er  fort,  wie  verhält  es  sich  damit?  Man \r\nerzählt  uns,  daß  alle  Menschen,  auch  die  keine  Christen \r\n\r\n\r\nFERR ÄRA  BIS  ROM  1786  121 \r\n\r\nsind,  dennoch  beichten  müssen;  weil  sie  aber  in  ihrer \r\nVerStockung  nicht  das  Rechte  treffen  können,  so  beich- \r\nten sie  einem  alten  Baume,  welches  denn  freilich  lächer- \r\nlich und  gottlos  genug  ist,  aber  doch  beweist,  daß  sie  die \r\nNotwendigkeit  der  Beichte  anerkennen.  —  Hierauf  er- \r\nklärte ich  ihm  unsere  Begriffe  von  der  Beichte,  und  wie \r\nes  dabei  zugehe.  Das  kam  ihm  sehr  bequem  vor;  er \r\nmeinte  aber,  es  sei  ungefähr  ebensogut,  als  wenn  man \r\neinem  Baum  beichtete.  Nach  einigem  Zaudern  ersucht' \r\ner  mich  sehr  ernsthaft,  über  einen  andern  Punkt  ihm \r\nredlich  Auskunft  zu  geben:  er  habe  nämlich  aus  dem \r\njMunde  eines  seiner  Priester,  der  ein  wahrhafter  Mann \r\nsei,  gehört,  daß  wir  unsere  Schwestern  heiraten  dürften, \r\nwelches  denn  doch  eine  starke  Sache  sei.  Als  ich  diesen \r\nPunkt  verneinte  und  ihm  einige  menschliche  Begriffe  von \r\nunserer  Lehre  beibringen  wollte,  mochte  er  nicht  sonder- \r\nlich darauf  merken;  denn  es  kam  ihm  zu  alltäglich  vor, \r\nund  er  wandte  sich  zu  einer  neuen  Frage:  Man  ver- \r\nsichert uns,  sagte  er,  daß  Friedrich  der  Große,  welcher \r\nso  viele  Siege  selbst  über  die  Gläubigen  davongetragen \r\nund  die  Welt  mit  seinem  Ruhm  erfüllt,  daß  er,  den  jeder- \r\nmann für  einen  Ketzer  hält,  wirklich  katholisch  sei  und \r\nvom  Papste  die  Erlaubnis  habe,  es  zu  verheimlichen; \r\ndenn  er  kommt,  wie  man  weiß,  in  keine  eurer  Kirchen, \r\nverrichtet  aber  seinen  Gottesdienst  in  einer  unterirdischen \r\nKapelle,  mit  zerknirschtem  Herzen,  daß  er  die  heilige \r\nReligion  nicht  öffentlich  bekennen  darf;  denn  freilich,  wenn \r\ner  das  täte,  würden  ihn  seine  Preußen,  die  ein  bestialisches \r\nVolk  und  wütende  Ketzer  sind,  auf  der  Stelle  totschlagen, \r\nwodurch  denn  der  Sache  nicht  geholfen  wäre.  Deswegen \r\nhat  ihm  der  heilige  Vater  jene  Erlaubnis  gegeben;  da- \r\nfür er  denn  aber  auch  die  alleinseligmachende  Religion \r\nim  stillen  so  viel  ausbreitet  und  begünstigt  als  möglich. — \r\nIch  ließ  das  alles  gelten  und  erwiderte  nur:  da  es  ein \r\ngroßes  Geheimnis  sei,  könnte  freilich  niemand  davon \r\nZeugnis  geben.  Unsere  fernere  Unterhaltung  war  unge- \r\nfähr immer  von  derselben  Art,  so  daß  ich  mich  über  die \r\nkluge  Geistlichkeit  wundern  mußte,  welche  alles  abzu- \r\nlehnen und  zu  entstellen  sucht,  was  den  dunkeln  Kreis \r\n\r\n\r\n1 2  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nihrer  herkömmlichen  Lehre  durchbrechen  und  verwirren \r\nkönnte. \r\n\r\n[Foligfio,  de7i  26.  Oktober  abends.] \r\nIch  verließ  Perugia  an  einem  herrlichen  Morgen  und \r\nfühlte  die  Sehgkeit,  wieder  allein  zu  sein.  Die  Lage  der \r\nStadt  ist  schön,  der  Anblick  des  Sees  höchst  erfreulich. \r\nIch  habe  mir  die  Bilder  wohl  eingedrückt.  Der  Weg  ging \r\nerst  hinab,  dann  in  einem  frohen,  an  beiden  Seiten  in \r\nder  Ferne  von  Hügeln  eingefaßten  Tale  hin;  endlich  sah \r\nich  Assisi  liegen. \r\n\r\nAus  Palladio  und  Volkmann  wußte  ich,  daß  ein  köstlicher \r\nTempel  der  Minerva,  zu  Zeiten  Augusts  gebaut,  noch \r\nvollkommen  erhalten  dastehe.  Ich  verließ  bei  Madonna \r\ndel  Angelo  meinen  Vetturin,  der  seinen  Weg  nach  Foli- \r\ngno  verfolgte,  und  stieg  unter  einem  starken  Wind  nach \r\nAssisi  hinauf;  denn  ich  sehnte  mich,  durch  die  für  mich \r\nso  einsame  Welt  eine  Fußwanderung  anzustellen.  Die \r\nungeheuren  Substruktionen  der  babylonisch  übereinander \r\ngetürmten  Kirchen,  wo  der  heilige  Franziskus  ruht,  ließ \r\nich  links,  mit  Abneigung;  denn  ich  dachte  mir,  daß  darin \r\ndie  Köpfe  so  wie  mein  Hauptmannskopf  gestempelt \r\nwürden.  Dann  fragte  ich  einen  hübschen  Jungen  nach \r\nder  Maria  della  Minerva;  er  begleitete  mich  die  Stadt \r\nhinauf,  die  an  einen  Berg  gebaut  ist.  Endlich  gelangten \r\nwir  in  die  eigentliche  alte  Stadt:  und  siehe,  das  löblichste \r\nWerk  stand  vor  meinen  Augen,  das  erste  vollständige \r\nDenkmal  der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  erblickte.  Einbescheidener \r\nTempel,  wie  er  sich  für  eine  so  kleine  Stadt  schickte,  und \r\ndoch  so  vollkommen,  so  schön  gedacht,  daß  er  überall \r\nglänzen  würde.  Nun  vorerst  von  seiner  Stellung!  Seit- \r\ndem ich  in  Vitruv  und  Palladio  gelesen,  wie  man  Städte \r\nbauen,  Tempel  und  öffentliche  Gebäude  stellen  müsse, \r\nhabe  ich  einen  großen  Respekt  vor  solchen  Dingen.  Auch \r\nhierin  waren  die  Alten  so  groß  im  Natürlichen.  Der \r\nTempel  steht  auf  der  schönen  mittlem  Höhe  des  Berges, \r\nwo  eben  zwei  Hügel  zusammentreffen,  auf  dem  Platz,  der \r\nnoch  jetzt  der  Platz  heißt.  Dieser  steigt  selbst  ein  wenig \r\nan,  und  es  kommen  auf  demselben  vierStraßen  zusammen, \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  123 \r\n\r\ndie  ein  sehr  gedrücktes  Andreaskreuz  machen,  zwei  von \r\nunten  herauf,  zwei  von  oben  herunter.  Wahrscheinlich \r\nstanden  zur  alten  Zeit  die  Häuser  noch  nicht,  die  jetzt, \r\ndem  Tempel  gegenüber  gebaut,  die  Aussicht  versperren. \r\nDenkt  man  sie  weg,  so  blickte  man  gegen  Mittag  in  die \r\nreichste  Gegend,  und  zugleich  würde  Minervens  Heilig- \r\ntum von  allen  Seiten  her  gesehen.  Die  Anlage  der  Straßen \r\nmag  alt  sein,  denn  sie  folgen  aus  der  Gestalt  und  dem \r\nAbhänge  des  Berges.  Der  Tempel  steht  nicht  in  der \r\nMitte  des  Platzes,  aber  so  gerichtet,  daß  er  dem  von  Rom \r\nHeraufkommenden  verkürzt  gar  schön  sichtbar  wird. \r\nNicht  allein  das  Gebäude  sollte  man  zeichnen,  sondern \r\nauch  die  glückliche  Stellung. \r\n\r\nAn  der  Fassade  konnte  ich  mich  nicht  satt  sehen,  wie \r\ngenialisch  konsequent  auch  hier  der  Künstler  gehandelt. \r\nDie  Ordnung  ist  korinthisch,  die  Säiüenweiten  etwas  über \r\nzwei  Model.  Die  Säulenfüße  und  die  Platten  darunter \r\nscheinen  auf  Piedestalen  zu  stehen,  aber  es  scheint  auch \r\nnur:  denn  der  Sockel  ist  fünfmal  durchschnitten,  und \r\njedesmal  gehen  fünf  Stufen  zwischen  den  Säulen  hinauf, \r\nda  man  denn  auf  die  Fläche  gelangt,  worauf  eigentlich \r\ndie  Säulen  stehen  und  von  welcher  man  auch  in  den \r\nTempel  hineingeht.  Das  Wagstück,  den  Sockel  zu  durch- \r\nschneiden, war  hier  am  rechten  Platze;  denn  da  der \r\nTempel  am  Berge  liegt,  so  hätte  die  Treppe,  die  zu  ihm \r\nhinaufführte,  viel  zu  weit  vorgelegt  werden  müssen  und \r\nwürde  den  Platz  verengt  haben.  Wie  viel  Stufen  noch \r\nunterhalb  gelegen,  läßt  sich  nicht  bestimmen;  sie  sind, \r\naußer  wenigen,  verschüttet  und  zugepflastert.  Ungern \r\nriß  ich  mich  von  dem  xA.nblick  los  und  nahm  mir  vor,  alle \r\nArchitekten  auf  dieses  Gebäude  aufmerksam  zu  machen, \r\ndamit  uns  ein  genauer  Riß  davon  zukäme.  Denn  was \r\nÜberlieferung  für  ein  schlechtes  Ding  sei,  mußte  ich \r\ndieses  Mal  wieder  bemerken.  Palladio,  auf  den  ich  alles \r\nvertraute,  gibt  zwar  dieses  Tempels  Bild,  er  kann  ihn \r\naber  nicht  selbst  gesehen  kaben;  denn  er  setzt  wirklich \r\nPiedestale  auf  die  Fläche,  wodurch  die  Säulen  unmäßig \r\nin  die  Höhe  kommen  und  ein  garstiges,  palmyrenisches \r\nUngeheuer    entsteht,    anstatt    daß    in    der  Wirklichkeit \r\n\r\n\r\n1 2  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nein  ruhiger,  lieblicher,  das  Auge  und  den  Verstand  be- \r\nfriedigender Anblick  erfreut.  Was  sich  durch  die  Be- \r\nschauung dieses  Werks  in  mir  entwickelt,  ist  nicht  aus- \r\nzusprechen und  wird  ewige  Früchte  bringen. \r\nIch  ging  am  schönsten  Abend  die  römische  Straße  bergab, \r\nim  Gemüt  zum  schönsten  beruhiget,  als  ich  hinter  mir \r\nrauhe,  heftige  Stimmen  vernahm,  die  untereinander \r\nstritten.  Ich  vermutete,  daß  es  die  Sbirren  sein  möchten, \r\ndie  ich  schon  in  der  Stadt  bemerkt  hatte.  Ich  ging  ge- \r\nlassen vor  mich  hin  und  horchte  hinterwärts.  Da  konnte \r\nich  nun  gar  bald  bemerken,  daß  es  auf  mich  gemünzt \r\nsei.  Vier  solcher  Menschen,  zwei  davon  mit  Flinten  be- \r\nwaffnet, in  unerfreulicher  Gestalt,  gingen  vor  mir  vorbei, \r\nbrummten,  kehrten  nach  einigen  Schritten  zurück  und \r\numgaben  mich.  Sie  fragten,  wer  ich  wäre  und  was  ich \r\nhier  täte?  Ich  erwiderte,  ich  sei  ein  Fremder,  der  seinen \r\nWeg  über  Assisi  zu  Fuß  mache,  indessen  der  Vetturin \r\nnach  Foligno  fahre.  Dies  kam  ihnen  nicht  wahrscheinlich \r\nvor,  daß  jemand  einen  Wagen  bezahle  und  zu  Fuße  gehe. \r\nSie  fragten,  ob  ich  im  Gran  Convento  gewesen  sei?  Ich \r\nverneinte  dies  und  versicherte  ihnen,  ich  kenne  das  Ge- \r\nbäude von  alten  Zeiten  her.  Da  ich  aber  ein  Baumeister \r\nsei,  habe  ich  diesmal  nur  die  Maria  della  Minerva  in \r\nAugenschein  genommen,  welches,  wie  sie  wüßten,  ein \r\nmusterhaftes  Gebäude  sei.  Das  leugneten  sie  nicht,  nah- \r\nmen aber  sehr  übel,  daß  ich  dem  Heiligen  meine  Auf- \r\nwartung nicht  gemacht,  und  gaben  ihren  Verdacht  zu \r\nerkennen,  daß  wohl  mein  Handwerk  sein  möchte,  Konter- \r\nbande einzuschwärzen.  Ich  zeigte  ihnen  das  Lächerliche, \r\ndaß  ein  Mensch,  der  allein  auf  der  Straße  gehe,  ohne \r\nRanzen,  mit  leeren  Taschen,  für  einen  Konterbandisten \r\ngehalten  werden  solle.  Darauf  erbot  ich  mich,  mit  ihnen \r\nnach  der  Stadt  zurück  und  zum  Podesta  zu  gehen,  ihm \r\nmeine  Papiere  vorzulegen,  da  er  mich  denn  als  einen \r\nelirenvollen  Fremden  anerkennen  werde.  Sie  brummten \r\nhierauf  und  meinten,  es  sei  nicht  nötig,  und  als  ich  mich \r\nimmerfort  mit  entschiedenem  Ernst  betrug,  entfernten  sie \r\nsich  endlich  wieder  nach  der  Stadt  zu.  Ich  sah  ihnen \r\npach.    Da  gingen  nun   diese  rohen  Kerls  im  Vorder- \r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARA  BIS  ROM  1786  125 \r\n\r\ngründe,  und  hinter  ihnen  her  blickte  mich  die  liebliche \r\nMinerva  noch  einmal  sehr  freundlich  und  tröstend  an; \r\ndann  schaute  ich  links  auf  den  tristen  Dom  des  heiligen \r\nFranziskus  und  wollte  meinen  Weg  verfolgen,  als  einer \r\nder  Unbewaffneten  sich  von  der  Truppe  sonderte  und \r\nganz  freundlich  auf  mich  loskam.  Grüßend  sagte  er  so- \r\ngleich: Ihr  solltet,  mein  Herr  Fremder,  wenigstens  mir \r\nein  Trinkgeld  geben;  denn  ich  versichere,  daß  ich  Euch \r\nalsobald  für  einen  braven  Mann  gehalten  und  dies  laut \r\ngegen  meine  Gesellen  erklärt  habe.  Das  sind  aber  Hitz- \r\nköpfe und  gleich  oben  hinaus  und  haben  keine  Welt- \r\nkenntnis. Auch  werdet  Ihr  bemerkt  haben,  daß  ich  Euren \r\nWorten  zuerst  Beifall  und  Gewicht  gab.  —  Ich  lobte  ihn \r\ndeshalb  und  ersuchte  ihn,  ehrenhafte  Fremde,  die  nach \r\nAssisi  sowohl  wegen  der  Religion  als  wegen  der  Kunst \r\nkämen,  zu  beschützen,  besonders  die  Baumeister,  die \r\nzum  Ruhme  der  Stadt  den  Minerventempel,  den  man \r\nnoch  niemals  recht  gezeichnet  und  in  Kupfer  gestochen, \r\nnunmehro  messen  und  abzeichnen  wollten.  Er  möchte \r\nihnen  zur  Hand  gehen,  da  sie  sich  denn  gewiß  dankbar \r\nerweisen  würden.  Und  somit  drückte  ich  ihm  einige \r\nSilberstücke  in  die  Hand,  die  ihn  über  seine  Erwartung \r\nerfreuten.  Er  bat  m.ich,  ja  wiederzukommen,  besonders \r\nmüsse  ich  das  Fest  des  Heiligen  nicht  versäumen,  wo \r\nich  mich  mit  größter  Sicherheit  erbauen  und  vergnügen \r\nsollte.  Ja,  wenn  es  mir,  als  einem  hübschen  Manne,  wie \r\nbillig,  um  ein  hübsches  Frauenzimmer  zu  tun  sei,  so  könne \r\ner  mir  versichern,  daß  die  schönste  und  ehrbarste  Frau  von \r\nganz  Assisi  auf  seine  Empfehlung  mich  mit  Freuden  auf- \r\nnehmen werde.  Er  schied  nun,  beteurend,  daß  er  noch \r\nheute  abend,  bei  dem  Grabe  des  Heiligen,  meiner  in \r\nAndacht  gedenken  und  für  meine  fernere  Reise  beten \r\nwolle.  So  trennten  wir  uns,  und  mir  war  sehr  wohl,  mit \r\nder  Natur  und  mit  mir  selbst  wieder  allein  zu  sein.  Der \r\nWeg  nach  Foligno  war  einer  der  schönsten  und  anmu- \r\ntigsten Spaziergänge,  die  ich  jemals  zurückgelegt.  Vier \r\nvolle  Stunden  an  einem  Berge  hin,  rechts  ein  reich- \r\nbebautes Tal. \r\nMit  den  Vetturinen  ist  es  eine  leidige  Fahrt;  das  beste, \r\n\r\n\r\n1 2  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ndaß  mau  ihnen  bequem  zu  Fuße  folgen  kann.  Von  Fer- \r\nrara  laß  ich  mich  nun  immer  bis  hieher  so  fortschleppen. \r\nDieses  Italien,  von  Natur  höchlich  begünstiget,  blieb  in \r\nallem  Mechanischen  und  Technischen,  worauf  doch  eine \r\nbequemere  und  frischere  Lebensweise  gegründet  ist, \r\ngegen  alle  Länder  unendlich  zurück.  Das  Fuhrwerk  der \r\nVetturine,  welches  noch  sedia,  ein  Sessel,  heißt,  ist  ge- \r\nwiß aus  den  alten  Tragsesseln  entstanden,  in  welchen \r\nsich  Frauen,  ältere  und  vornehmere  Personen  von  Maul- \r\ntieren tragen  ließen.  Statt  des  hintern  Maultiers,  das  man \r\nhervor  neben  die  Gabel  spannte,  setzte  man  zwei  Räder \r\nunter,  und  an  keine  weitere  Verbesserung  ward  gedacht. \r\nMan  wird,  wie  vor  Jahrhunderten,  noch  immer  fort- \r\ngeschaukelt; und  so  sind  sie  in  ihren  Wohnungen  und \r\nallem. \r\n\r\nWenn  man  die  erste  poetische  Idee,  daß  die  Menschen \r\nmeist  imter  freiem  Himmel  lebten  und  sich  gelegentlich \r\nmanchmal  aus  Not  in  Höhlen  zurückzogen,  noch  reali- \r\nsiert sehen  will,  so  muß  man  die  Gebäude  hier  herum, \r\nbesonders  auf  dem  Lande,  betreten,  ganz  im  Sinn  und \r\nGeschmack  der  Höhlen.  Eine  so  unglaubliche  Sorg- \r\nlosigkeit haben  sie,  um  über  dem  Nachdenken  nicht  zu \r\nveralten.  Mit  unerhörtem  Leichtsinn  versäumen  sie,  sich \r\nauf  den  Winter,  auf  längere  Nächte  vorzubereiten,  und \r\nleiden  deshalb  einen  guten  Teil  des  Jahres  wie  die  Hunde. \r\nHier  in  Foligno,  in  einer  völlig  homerischen  Haushaltung, \r\nwo  alles  um  ein  auf  der  Erde  brennendes  Feuer  in  einer \r\ngroßen  Halle  versammelt  ist,  schreit  und  lärmt,  am  langen \r\nTische  speist,  wie  die  Hochzeit  von  Kana  gemalt  wird, \r\nergreife  ich  die  Gelegenheit,  dieses  zu  schreiben,  da  einer \r\nein  Tintenfaß  holen  läßt,  woran  ich  unter  solchen  Um- \r\nständen nicht  gedacht  hätte.  Aber  man  sieht  auch \r\ndiesem  Blatt  die  Kälte  und  die  Unbequemlichkeit  meines \r\nSchreibtisches  an. \r\n\r\nJetzt  fühl  ich  wohl  die  Verwegenheit,  unvorbereitet  und \r\nunbegleitet  in  dieses  Land  zu  gehen.  Mit  dem  ver- \r\nschiedenen Gelde,  den  Vetturinen,  den  Preisen,  den \r\nschlechten  Wirtshäusern  ist  es  eine  tagtägliche  Not,  daß \r\neiner  der  zum  ersten  Male,  wie  ich,  allein  geht  und  un- \r\n\r\n\r\nFERR ÄRA  BIS  ROM  1786  127 \r\n\r\nunterbrochnen  Genuß  hoffte  und  suchte,  sich  unglück- \r\nlich genug\"  fühlen  müßte.  Ich  habe  nichts  gewollt  als  das \r\nLand  sehen,  aufweiche  Kosten  es  sei;  und  wenn  sie  mich \r\nauf  Ixions  Rad  nach  Rom  schleppen,  so  will  ich  mich \r\nnicht  beklagen. \r\n\r\nTer/ii,  den  2y.  Oktober  abcfids. \r\nWieder  in  einer  Höhle  sitzend,  die  vor  einem  Jahr  vom \r\nErdbeben  gelitten.  Das  Städtchen  liegt  in  einer  köst- \r\nlichen Gegend,  die  ich  auf  einem  Rundgange  um  das- \r\nselbe her  mit  Freuden  beschaute,  am  Anfang  einer  schö- \r\nnen Plaine  zwischen  Bergen,  die  alle  noch  Kalk  sind. \r\nWie  Bologna  drüben,  so  ist  Terni  hüben  an  den  Fuß  des \r\nGebirgs  gesetzt. \r\n\r\nNun,  da  der  päpstliche  Soldat  mich  verlassen,  ist  ein \r\nPriester  mein  Gefährte.  Dieser  scheint  schon  mehr  mit \r\nseinem  Zustande  zufrieden  und  belehrt  mich,  den  er \r\nfreilich  schon  als  Ketzer  erkennt,  auf  meine  Fragen  sehr \r\ngern  von  dem  Ritus  und  andern  dahin  gehörigen  Dingen. \r\nDadurch,  daß  ich  immer  wieder  unter  neue  Menschen \r\nkomme,  erreiche  ich  durchaus  meine  Absicht;  man  muß \r\ndas  Volk  nur  untereinander  reden  hören,  was  das  für  ein \r\nlebendiges  Bild  des  ganzen  Landes  gibt!  Sie  sind  auf \r\ndie  wunderbarste  Weise  sämtlich  Widersacher,  haben  den \r\nsonderbarsten  Provinzial-  und  Stadteifer,  können  sich  alle \r\nnicht  leiden;  die  Stände  sind  in  ewigem  Streit,  und  das \r\nalles  mit  immer  lebhafter,  gegenwärtiger  Leidenschaft, \r\ndaß  sie  einem  den  ganzen  Tag  Komödie  geben  und  sich \r\nbloßstellen,  und  doch  fassen  sie  zugleich  wieder  auf  und \r\nmerken  gleich,  wo  der  Fremde  sich  in  ihr  Tun  und  Lassen \r\nnicht  finden  kann. \r\n\r\nSpoleto  hab  ich  bestiegen  und  war  auf  der  Wasserleitung, \r\ndie  zugleich  Brücke  von  einem  Berg  zu  einem  andern \r\nist.  Die  zehen  Bogen,  welche  über  das  Tal  reichen,  stehen \r\nvon  Backsteinen  ihre  Jahrhunderte  so  ruhig  da,  und  das \r\nWasser  quillt  immer  noch  in  Spoleto  an  allen  Orten  und \r\nEnden.  Das  ist  nun  das  dritte  Werk  der  Alten,  das  ich \r\nsehe,  und  immer  derselbe  große  Sinn.  Eine  zweite  Natur, \r\ndie  zu  bürgerlichen  Zwecken  handelt,  das  ist  ihre  Bau- \r\n\r\n\r\n.1 2  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nkunst:  so  steht  das  Amphitheater,  der  Tempel  und  der \r\nAquädukt.  Nun  fühle  ich  erst,  wie  mir  mit  Recht  alle \r\nWillkürlichkeiten  verhaßt  waren,  wie  zum  Beispiel  der \r\nWinterkasten  auf  dem  Weißenstein,  ein  Nichts  um  nichts, \r\nein  ungeheurer  Konfektaufsatz,  und  so  mit  tausend  an- \r\ndern Dingen.  Das  steht  nun  alles  totgeboren  da,  denn \r\nwas  nicht  eine  wahre  innere  Existenz  hat,  hat  kein  Leben \r\nund  kann  nicht  groß  sein  und  nicht  groß  werden. \r\nWas  bin  ich  nicht  den  letzten  acht  W^ochen  schuldig  ge- \r\nworden an  Freuden  und  Einsicht;  aber  auch  Mühe  hat \r\nmich's  genug  gekostet.  Ich  halte  die  Augen  nur  immer \r\noffen  und  drücke  mir  die  Gegenstände  recht  ein.  Urteilen \r\nmöchte  ich  gar  nicht,  wenn  es  nur  möglich  wäre. \r\nSan  Crocefisso,  eine  wunderliche  Kapelle  am  Wege,  halte \r\nich  nicht  für  den  Rest  eines  Tempels,  der  am  Orte  stand, \r\nsondern  man  hat  Säulen,  Pfeiler,  Gebälke  gefunden  und \r\nzusammengeflickt,  nicht  dumm,  aber  toll.  Beschreiben \r\nläßt  sich's  gar  nicht;  es  ist  wohl  irgendwo  in  Kupfer  ge- \r\nstochen. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  wird  es  einem  denn  doch  wunderbar  zumute, \r\ndaß  uns,  indem  wir  bemüht  sind,  einen  Begriff  des  Alter- \r\ntums zu  erwerben,  nur  Ruinen  entgegenstehen,  aus  denen \r\nman  sich  nun  wieder  das  kümmerlich  aufzuerbauen  hätte, \r\nwovon  man  noch  keinen  Begriff  hat. \r\nMit  dem,  was  man  klassischen  Boden  nennt,  hat  es  eine \r\nandere  Bewandtnis.  Wenn  man  hier  nicht  phantastisch \r\nverfährt,  sondern  die  Gegend  real  nimmt,  wie  sie  da- \r\nliegt, so  ist  sie  doch  immer  der  entscheidende  Schau- \r\nplatz, der  die  größten  Taten  bedingt;  und  so  habe  ich \r\nimmer  bisher  den  geologischen  und  landschaftlichen  Blick \r\nbenutzt,  um  Fjnbildungskraft  und  Empfindung  zu  unter- \r\ndrücken und  mir  ein  freies  klares  Anschauen  der  Lokalität \r\nzu  erhalten.  Da  schließt  sich  denn  auf  eine  wundersame \r\nWeise  die  Geschichte  lebendig  an,  und  man  begreift \r\nnicht,  wie  einem  geschieht,  und  ich  fühle  die  größte \r\nSehnsucht,  den  Tacitus  in  Rom  zu  lesen. \r\nDas  Wetter  darf  ich  auch  nicht  ganz  hintansetzen.  Da \r\nich  von  Bologna  die  Apenninen  heraufkam,  zogen  die \r\nWolken  noch  immer  nach  Norden;  späterhin  veränderten \r\n\r\n\r\nFERR ÄRA  BIS  ROM  1786  129 \r\n\r\nsie  ihre  Richtung  und  zogen  nach  dem  Trasimenischen \r\nSee.  Hier  blieben  sie  hangen,  zogen  auch  wohl  gegen \r\nMittag.  Statt  also  daß  die  große  Plaine  des  Po  den \r\nSommer  über  alle  Wolken  nach  dem  Tiroler  Gebirg \r\nschickt,  sendet  sie  jetzt  einen  Teil  nach  den  Apenninen; \r\ndaher  mag  die  Regenzeit  kommen. \r\n\r\nMan  fängt  nun  an,  die  Oliven  abzulesen.  Sie  tun  es \r\nhier  mit  den  Händen,  an  andern  Orten  schlagen  sie  mit \r\nStöcken  drein.  Kommt  ein  frühzeitiger  Winter,  so  blei- \r\nben die  übrigen  bis  gegen  das  Frühjahr  hängen.  Heute \r\nhabe  ich  auf  sehr  steinigem  Boden  die  größten  ältesten \r\nBäume  gesehen. \r\n\r\nDie  Gunst  der  Musen,  wie  die  der  Dämonen,  besucht  uns \r\nnicht  immer  zur  rechten  Zeit.  Heute  ward  ich  aufgeregt, \r\netwas  auszubilden,  was  gar  nicht  an  der  Zeit  ist.  Dem \r\nMittelpunkte  des  Katholizismus  mich  nähernd,  von \r\nKatholiken  umgeben,  mit  einem  Priester  in  eine  Sedie \r\neingesperrt,  indem  ich  mit  reinstem  Sinn  die  wahrhafte \r\nNatur  und  die  edle  Kunst  zu  beobachten  und  aufzufassen \r\ntrachte,  trat  mir  so  lebhaft  vor  die  Seele,  daß  vom  ur- \r\nsprünglichen Christentum  alle  Spur  verloschen  ist;  ja  wenn \r\nich  mir  es  in  seiner  Reinheit  vergegenwärtigte,  so  wie \r\nwir  es  in  der  Apostelgeschichte  sehen,  so  mußte  mir \r\nschaudern,  was  nun  auf  jenen  gemütlichen  Anfängen  ein \r\nunförmliches,  ja  barockes  Heidentum  lastet.  Da  fiel  mir \r\nder  ewige  Jude  wieder  ein,  der  Zeuge  aller  dieser  wunder- \r\nsamen Ent-  und  Aufwicklungen  gewesen  und  so  einen \r\nwunderlichen  Zustand  erlebte,  daß  Christus  selbst,  als \r\ner  zurückkommt,  um  sich  nach  den  Früchten  seiner \r\nLehre  umzusehen,  in  Gefahr  gerät,  zum  zweitenmal  ge- \r\nkreuzigt zu  werden.  Jene  Legende:  Venio  iterum  crucifigi, \r\nsollte  mir  bei  dieser  Katastrophe  zum  Stoff  dienen. \r\nDergleichen  Träume  schweben  mir  vor.  Denn  aus  Un- \r\ngeduld, weiter  zu  kommen,  schlafe  ich  angekleidet  und \r\nweiß  nichts  Hübscheres,  als  vor  Tag  aufgeweckt  zu  wer- \r\nden, mich  schnell  in  den  Wagen  zu  setzen  und  zwischen \r\nSchlaf  und  Wachen  dem  Tag  entgegen  zu  fahren  und \r\ndabei  die  ersten  besten  Phantasiebilder  nach  Belieben \r\nwalten  zu  lassen. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  9 \r\n\r\n\r\nI30  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nCittä  Castellana^  den  28.  Oktober. \r\nDen  letzten  Abend  will  ich  nicht  fehlen.  Es  ist  noch  nicht \r\nacht  Uhr,  und  alles  schon  zu  Bette;  so  kann  ich  noch \r\nzu  guter  Letzt  des  Vergangenen  gedenken  und  mich  aufs \r\nNiichstkünftige  freuen.  Heute  war  ein  ganz  heiterer  herr- \r\nlicher Tag,  der  Morgen  sehr  kalt,  der  Tag  klar  und  warm, \r\nder  Abend  etwas  windig,  aber  sehr  schön. \r\nVon  Terni  fuhren  wir  sehr  früh  aus;  Narni  kamen  wir \r\nhinauf,  ehe  es  Tag  war,  und  so  habe  ich  die  Brücke  nicht \r\ngesehen.  Taler  und  Tiefen,  Nähe  und  Fernen,  köstliche \r\nGegenden,  alles  Kalkgebirg,  auch  nicht  eine  Spur  eines \r\nandern  Gesteins. \r\n\r\nOtricoli  liegt  auf  einem  der  von  den  ehemaligen  Strö- \r\nmungen zusammengeschwemmten  Kieshügel  und  ist  von \r\nLava  gebaut,  jenseits  des  Flusses  hergeholt. \r\nSobald  man  über  die  Brücke  hinüber  ist,  findet  man  sich \r\nim  vulkanischen  Terrain,  es  sei  nun  unter  wirklichen \r\nLaven  oder  unter  früherm  Gestein,  durch  Röstung  und \r\nSchmelzung  verändert.  Man  steigt  einen  Berg  herauf, \r\nden  man  für  graue  Lava  ansprechen  möchte;  sie  enthält \r\nviele  weiße,  granatförmig  gebildete  Kristalle.  DieChaussee, \r\ndie  von  der  Höhe  nach  Cittä  Castellana  geht,  von  eben \r\ndiesem  Stein,  sehr  schön  glatt  gefahren,  die  Stadt  auf  vul- \r\nkanischen Tuff  gebaut,  in  welchem  ich  Asche,  Bimsstein \r\nundLavastücke  zu  entdecken  glaubte.  Vom  Schlosse  istdie \r\nAussicht  sehr  schön;  der  Berg  Soracte  steht  einzeln  gar \r\nmalerisch  da,  wahrscheinlich  ein  zu  den  Apenninen  ge- \r\nhöriger Kalkberg.  Die  vulkanisierenden  Strecken  sind \r\nviel  niedriger  als  die  A])cnninen,  und  nur  das  durch- \r\nreißende Wasser  hat  aus  ihnen  Berge  und  Felsen  gebildet, \r\nda  denn  herrlich  malerische  Gegenstände,  überhangende \r\nKlippen  und  sonstige  landschaftliche  Zufälligkeiten  ge- \r\nbildet werden. \r\n\r\nMorgen  abend  also  in  Rom.  Ich  glaube  es  noch  jetzt \r\nkaum,  und  wenn  dieser  Wunsch  erfüllt  ist,  was  soll  ich \r\nmir  nachher  wünschen;  ich  wüßte  nichts,  als  daß  ich  mit \r\nmeinem  Fasanenkahn  glücklich  zu  Hause  landen  und \r\nmeine  Freunde  gesund,  froh  und  wohlwollend  antrefien \r\nmöge. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  131 \r\n\r\nROM \r\n\r\nRom^  den  i.  November  i'j86. \r\n\r\nENDLICH  kann  ich  den  Mund  auftun  und  meine  Freimde \r\nmit  Frohsinn  begrüßen.  Verziehen  sei  mir  das  Ge- \r\nheimnis und  die  gleichsam  unterirdische  Reise  hierher. \r\nKaum  wagte  ich  mir  selbst  zu  sagen,  wohin  ich  ging; \r\nselbst  unterwegs  fürchtete  ich  noch,  und  nur  unter  der \r\nPorta  del  Popolo  war  ich  mir  gewiß,  Rom  zu  haben. \r\nUnd  laßt  mich  nun  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  tausendmal,  ja \r\nbeständig  eurer  gedenke,  in  der  Nähe  der  Gegenstände, \r\ndie  ich  allein  zu  sehen  niemals  glaubte.  Nur  da  ich  jeder- \r\nmann mit  Leib  und  Seele  in  Norden  gefesselt,  alle  An- \r\nmutung nach  diesen  Gegenden  verschwunden  sah,  konnte \r\nich  mich  entschließen,  einen  langen  einsamen  Weg  zu \r\nmachen  und  den  Mittelpunkt  zu  suchen,  nach  dem  mich \r\nein  unwiderstehliches  Bedürfnis  hinzog.  Ja  die  letzten \r\nJahre  wurde  es  eine  Art  von  Krankheit,  von  der  mich \r\nnur  der  Anblick  und  die  Gegenwart  heilen  konnte.  Jetzt \r\ndarf  ich  es  gestehen:  zuletzt  dürft  ich  kein  lateinisch \r\nBuch  mehr  ansehen,  keine  Zeichnung  einer  italienischen \r\nGegend.  Die  Begierde,  dieses  Land  zu  sehen,  v/ar  über- \r\nreif; da  sie  befriedigt  ist,  werden  mir  Freunde  und  Vater- \r\nland erst  wieder  recht  aus  dem  Grunde  lieb  und  die \r\nRückkehr  wünschenswert,  ja  um  desto  wünschenswerter, \r\nda  ich  mit  Sicherheit  empfinde  ^  daß  ich  so  viele  Schätze \r\nnicht  zu  eignem  Besitz  und  Privatgebrauch  mitbringe, \r\nsondern  daß  sie  mir  und  andern  durchs  ganze  Leben  zur \r\nLeitung  und  Fordernis  dienen  sollen. \r\n\r\nRom^  den  i.  November. \r\nJa  ich  bin  endlich  in  dieser  Hauptstadt  der  Welt  ange- \r\nlangt! Wenn  ich  sie  in  guter  Begleitung,  angeführt  von \r\neinem  recht  verständigen  Manne,  vor  fünfzehn  Jahren  ge- \r\nsehn hätte,  wollte  ich  mich  glücklich  preisen.  Sollte  ich \r\nsie  aber  allein,  mit  eignen  Augen  sehen  und  besuchen,  so \r\nist  es  gut,  daß  mir  diese  Freude  so  spät  zuteil  ward. \r\nÜber  das  Tiroler  Gebirg  bin  ich  gleichsam  weggeflogen. \r\nVerona,  Vicenza,  Padua,  Venedig  habe  ich  gut,  Ferrara, \r\n\r\n\r\n132  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nCento,  Bologna  flüchtig  und  Florenz  kaum  gesehen.  Die \r\nBegierde,  nach  Rom  zu  kommen,  war  so  groß,  wuchs  so \r\nsehr  mit  jedem  Augenblicke,  daß  kein  Bleibens  mehr  war \r\nund  ich  mich  nur  drei  Stunden  in  Florenz  aufhielt.  Nun \r\nbin  ich  hier  und  ruhig  und,  wie  es  scheint,  auf  mein  ganzes \r\nLeben  beruhigt.  Denn  es  geht,  man  darf  wohl  sagen,  ein \r\nneues  Leben  an,  wenn  man  das  Ganze  mit  Augen  sieht, \r\ndas  man  teilweise  in-  und  auswendig  kennt.  Alle  Träume \r\nmeiner  Jugend  seh  ich  nun  lebendig,  die  ersten  Kupfer- \r\nbilder, deren  ich  mich  erinnere — mein  Vater  hatte  die \r\nProspekte  von  Rom  auf  einem  Vorsaale  aufgehängt  — \r\nseh  ich  nun  in  Wahrheit,  und  alles,  was  ich  in  Gemälden \r\nund  Zeichnungen,  Kupfern  und  Holzschnitten,  in  Gips \r\nund  Kork  schon  lange  gekannt,  steht  nun  beisammen  vor \r\nmir;  wohin  ich  gehe,  finde  ich  eine  Bekanntschaft  in \r\neiner  neuen  Welt;  es  ist  alles,  wie  ich  mir's  dachte,  und \r\nalles  neu.  Ebenso  kann  ich  von  meinen  Beobachtungen, \r\nvon  meinen  Ideen  sagen.  Ich  habe  keinen  ganz  neuen \r\nGedanken  gehabt,  nichts  ganz. fremd  gefunden,  aber  die \r\nalten  sind  so  bestimmt,  so  lebendig,  so  zusammenhängend \r\ngeworden,  daß  sie  für  neu  gelten  können. \r\nDa  Pygmalions  Elise,  die  er  sich  ganz  nach  seinen  Wün- \r\nschen geformt  und  ihr  so  viel  Wahrheit  und  Dasein  ge- \r\ngeben hatte,  als  der  Künstler  vermag,  endlich  auf  ihn \r\nzukam  und  sagte:  ich  bijüsl — wie  anders  war  die  Leben- \r\ndige als  der  gebildete  Stein. \r\n\r\nWie  moralisch  heilsam  ist  mir  es  dann  auch,  imter  einem \r\nganz  sinnlichen  Volke  zu  leben,  über  das  so  viel  Redens \r\nund  Schreibens  ist,  das  jeder  Fremde  nach  dem  Maß- \r\nstabe  beurteilt,  den  er  mitbringt.  Ich  verzeihe  jedem, \r\nder  sie  tadelt  und  schilt;  sie  stehn  zu  weit  von  uns  ab, \r\nund  als  Fremder  mit  ihnen  zu  verkehren,  ist  beschwerlich \r\nund  kostspielig. \r\n\r\nRom^  dai  j.  November. \r\n\r\nEiner  der  Hauptbeweggründe,  die  ich  mir  vorspiegelte, \r\num  nach  Rom  zu  eilen,  war  das  Fest  Allerheiligen, \r\nder  erste  November.  Denn  ich  dachte:  geschieht  dem \r\neinzelnen  Heiligen  so  viel  Ehre,  was  wird  es  erst  mit \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  133 \r\n\r\nallen  werden.  Allein  wie  sehr  betrog  ich  mich.  Kein \r\nauffallend  allgemeines  Fest  hatte  die  römische  Kirche \r\nbeliebt,  und  jeder  Orden  mochte  im  besondern  das  An- \r\ndenken seines  Patrons  im  stillen  feiern;  denn  das  Namens- \r\nfest und  der  ihm  zugeteilte  Ehrentag  ist's  eigentlich,  wo \r\njeder  in  einer  Glorie  erscheint. \r\n\r\nGestern  aber,  am  Tage  Allerseelen,  gelang  mir's  besser. \r\nDas  Andenken  dieser  feiert  der  Papst  in  seiner  Haus- \r\nkapelle auf  dem  Quirinal.  Jedermann  hat  freien  Zutritt. \r\nIch  eilte  mit  Tischbein  auf  den  Monte  Cavallo.  Der \r\nPlatz  vor  dem  Palaste  hat  was  ganz  eignes  Individuelles, \r\nso  unregelmäßig  als  grandios  und  lieblich.  Die  beiden \r\nKolossen  erblickt  ich  nun!  Weder  Auge  noch  Geist  sind \r\nhinreichend,  sie  zu  fassen.  Wir  eilten  mit  der  Menge \r\ndurch  den  prächtig  geräumigen  Hof  eine  übergeräumige \r\nTreppe  hinauf.  In  diesen  Vorsälen,  der  Kapelle  gegen- \r\nüber, in  der  Ansicht  der  Reihe  von  Zimmern  fühlt  man \r\nsich  wunderbar  unter  einem  Dache  mit  dem  Statthalter \r\nChristi. \r\n\r\nDie  Funktion  war  angegangen,  Papst  und  Kardinäle  schon \r\nin  der  Kirche.  Der  Heilige  Vater,  die  schönste  würdigste \r\nMännergestalt,  Kardinäle  von  verschiedenem  Alter  und \r\nBildung. \r\n\r\nMich  ergriff  ein  wunderbar  Verlangen,  das  Oberhaupt  der \r\nKirche  möge  den  goldenen  Mund  auftun  und,  von  dem \r\nunaussprechlichen  Heil  der  seligen  Seelen  mit  Entzücken \r\nsprechend,  uns  in  Entzücken  versetzen.  Da  ich  ihn  aber \r\nvor  dem  Altare  sich  nur  hin  und  her  bewegen  sah,  bald \r\nnach  dieser  bald  nach  jener  Seite  sich  wendend,  sich  wie \r\nein  gemeiner  Pfaffe  gebärdend  und  murmelnd,  da  regte \r\nsich  die  protestantische  Erbsünde,  und  mir  wollte  das  be- \r\nkannte und  gewohnte  Meßopfer  hier  keineswegs  gefallen. \r\nHat  doch  Christus  schon  als  Knabe  durch  mündliche  Aus- \r\nlegung der  Schrift  und  in  seinem  Jünglingsleben  gewiß \r\nnicht  schweigend  gelehrt  und  gewirkt;  denn  er  sprach \r\ngern,  geistreich  und  gut,  wie  wir  aus  den  Evangelien \r\nwissen.  Was  würde  der  sagen,  dacht  ich,  wenn  er  herein- \r\nträte und  sein  Ebenbüd  auf  Erden  summend  und  hin  und \r\nwider  wankend  anträfe?    Das  Venio  iterum  crucifigi  fiel \r\n\r\n\r\n134  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nmir  ein,  und  ich  zupfte  meinen  Gefährten,  daß  wir  ins \r\nFreie  der  gewölbten  und  gemalten  Säle  kämen. \r\nHier  fanden  wir  eine  Menge  Personen,  die  köstlichen  Ge- \r\nmälde aufmerksam  betrachtend;  denn  dieses  Fest  Aller- \r\nseelen ist  auch  zugleich  das  Fest  aller  Künstler  in  Rom. \r\nEbenso  wie  die  Kapelle  ist  der  ganze  Palast  und  die  sämt- \r\nlichen Zimmer  jedem  zugänglich  und  diesen  Tag  für  viele \r\nStunden  frei  und  offen;  man  braucht  kein  Trinkgeld  zu \r\ngeben  und  wird  von  dem  Kastellan  nicht  gedrängt. \r\nDie  Wandgemälde  beschäftigten  mich,  und  ich  lernte  da \r\nneue,  mir  kaum  dem  Namen  nach  bekannte  treffliche \r\nMänner  kennen,  so  wie  zum  Beispiel  den  heitern  Karl \r\nMaratti  schätzen  und  lieben. \r\n\r\nVorzüglich  willkommen  aber  waren  mir  die  Meisterstücke \r\nder  Künstler,  deren  Art  und  Weise  ich  mir  schon  einge- \r\nprägt hatte.  Ich  sah  mit  Bewunderung  die  heilige  Petro- \r\nnilla  von  Guercin,  ehemals  in  St.  Peter,  wo  nun  eine \r\nmusivische  Kopie  anstatt  des  Originals  aufgestellt  ist. \r\nDer  Heiligen  Leichnam  wird  aus  dem  Grabe  gehoben  und \r\ndieselbe  Person,  neubelebt,  in  der  Himmelshöhe  von  einem \r\ngöttlichen  Jüngling  empfangen.  Was  man  auch  gegen \r\ndiese  doppelte  Handlung  sagen  mag,  das  Bild  ist  un- \r\nschätzbar. \r\n\r\nNoch  mehr  erstaunte  ich  vor  einem  Bilde  von  Tizian.  Es \r\nüberleuchtet  alle,  die  ich  gesehen  habe.  Ob  mein  Sinn \r\nschon  geübter  oder  ob  es  wirklich  das  vortrefflichste  sei, \r\nweiß  ich  nicht  zu  unterscheiden.  Ein  ungeheures  Meß- \r\ngewand, das  von  Stickerei,  ja  von  getriebenen  Goldfiguren \r\nstarrt,  umhüllt  eine  ansehnliche  bischöfliche  Gestalt. \r\nDen  massiven  Hirtenstab  in  der  Linken,  blickt  er  ent- \r\nzückt in  die  Höhe,  mit  der  Rechten  hält  er  ein  Buch, \r\nworaus  er  soeben  eine  göttliche  Berührung  empfangen \r\nzu  haben  scheint.  Hinter  ihm  eine  schöne  Jungfrau,  die \r\nPalme  in  der  Hand,  mit  lieblicher  Teilnahme  nach  dem \r\naufgeschlagenen  Buche  hinschauend.  Ein  ernster  Alter \r\ndagegen  zur  Rechten;  dem  Buche  ganz  nahe,  scheint  er \r\ndessen  nicht  zu  achten:  die  Schlüssel  in  der  Hand,  mag \r\ner  sich  wohl  eigenen  Aufschluß  zutrauen.  Dieser  Gruppe \r\ngegenüber  ein  nackter,  wohlgebildeter,  gebundener,  von \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  135 \r\n\r\nPfeilen  verletzter  Jüngling,  vor  sich  hinsehend,  bescheiden \r\nergeben.  In  dem  Zwischenräume  zwei  Mönche,  Kreuz \r\nund  Lilie  tragend,  andächtig  gegen  die  Himmlischen  ge- \r\nkehrt; denn  oben  oöen  ist  das  halbrunde  Gemäuer,  das \r\nsie  sämtlich  umschließt.  Dort  bewegt  sich  in  höchster \r\nGlorie  eine  herabwärts  teilnehmende  Mutter.  Das  lebendig \r\nmuntere  Kind  in  ihrem  Schöße  reicht  mit  heiterer  Ge- \r\nbärde einen  Kranz  herüber,  ja  scheint  ihn  herunter  zu \r\nwerfen.  Auf  beiden  Seiten  schweben  Engel,  Kränze  schon \r\nim  Vorrat  haltend.  Über  allen  aber  und  über  dreifachem \r\nStrahlenkreise  waltet  die  himmlische  Taube,  als  Mittel- \r\npunkt und  Schlußstein  zugleich. \r\n\r\nWir  sagen  uns:  hier  muß  ein  heiliges  altes  Überliefertes \r\nzum  Grunde  liegen,  daß  diese  verschiedenen  unpassen- \r\nden Personen  so  kunstreich  und  bedeutungsvoll  zusam- \r\nmengestellt werden  konnten.  Wir  fragen  nicht  nach  Wie \r\nund  Warum,  wir  lassen  es  geschehen  und  bewundern  die \r\nunschätzbare  Kunst. \r\n\r\nWeniger  unverständlich,  aber  doch  geheimnisvoll  ist  ein \r\nWandbild  von  Guido  in  seiner  Kapelle.  Die  kindlich \r\nlieblichste,  frömmste  Jungfrau  sitzt  still  vor  sich  hin  und \r\nnäht;  zwei  Engel  ihr  zur  Seiten  erwarten  jeden  Wink, \r\nihr  zu  dienen.  Daß  jugendliche  Unschuld  und  Fleiß  von \r\nden  Himmlischen  bewacht  und  geehrt  werde,  sagt  uns \r\ndas  liebe  Bild.  Es  bedarf  hier  keiner  Legende,  keiner \r\nAuslegung. \r\n\r\nNun  aber  zu  Milderung  des  künstlerischen  Ernstes  ein \r\nheiteres  Abenteuer.  Ich  bemerkte  wohl,  daß  mehrere \r\ndeutsche  Künstler,  zu  Tischbein  als  Bekannte  tretend, \r\nmich  beobachteten  und  sodann  hin  und  wider  gingen. \r\nEr,  der  mich  einige  Augenblicke  verlassen  hatte,  trat \r\nwieder  zu  mir  und  sagte:  Da  gibt's  einen  großen  Spaßl \r\nDas  Gerücht,  Sie  seien  hier,  hatte  sich  schon  verbreitet, \r\nund  die  Künstler  wurden  auf  den  einzigen  unbekannten \r\nFremden  aufmerksam.  Nun  ist  einer  unter  uns,  der  schon \r\nlängst  behauptet,  er  sei  mit  Ihnen  umgegangen,  ja  er \r\nwollte  mit  Ihnen  in  freundschaftlichem  Verhältnis  gelebt \r\nhaben,  woran  wir  nicht  so  recht  glauben  wollten.  Dieser \r\nward  aufgefordert,  Sie  zu  betrachten  und  den  Zweifel  zu \r\n\r\n\r\n136  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nlösen;  er  versicherte  aber  kurz  und  gut,  Sie  seien  es  nicht, \r\nund  an  dem  Fremden  keine  Spur  Ihrer  Gestalt  und  Aus- \r\nsehns.  So  ist  doch  wenigstens  das  Inkognito  für  den \r\nMoment  gedeckt,  und  in  der  Folge  gibt  es  etwas  zu \r\nlachen. \r\n\r\nIch  mischte  mich  nun  freimütiger  unter  die  Künstler- \r\nschar und  fragte  nach  den  Meistern  verschiedener  Bilder, \r\nderen  Kunstweise  mir  noch  nicht  bekannt  geworden. \r\nEndlich  zog  mich  ein  Bild  besonders  an,  den  heiligen \r\nGeorg,  den  Drachenüberwinder  und  Jungfrauenbefreier, \r\nvorstellend.  Niemand  konnte  mir  den  Meister  nennen. \r\nDa  trat  ein  kleiner,  bescheidener,  bisher  lautloser  Mann \r\nhervor  und  belehrte  mich,  es  sei  von  Pordenone,  dem \r\nVenezianer,  eines  seiner  besten  Bilder,  an  dem  man  sein \r\nganzes  Verdienst  erkenne.  Nun  könnt  ich  meine  Neigimg \r\ngar  wohl  erklären:  das  Bild  hatte  mich  angemutet,  weil \r\nich,  mit  der  venezianischen  Schule  schon  näher  bekannt, \r\ndie  Tugenden  ihrer  Meister  besser  zu  schätzen  wußte. \r\nDer  belehrende  Künstler  ist  Heinrich  Meyer,  ein  Schwei- \r\nzer, der  mit  einem  Freunde  namens  Cölla  seit  einigen \r\nJahren  hier  studiert,  die  antiken  Büsten  in  Sepia  vor- \r\ntrefflich nachbildet  und  in  der  Kunstgeschichte  wohl  er- \r\nfahren ist. \r\n\r\nRom.  den  5.  November. \r\nNun  bin  ich  sieben  Tage  hier,  und  nach  und  nach  tritt \r\nin  meiner  Seele  der  allgemeine  Begrift\"  dieser  Stadt  her- \r\nvor. Wir  gehn  fleißig  hin  und  wider,  ich  mache  mir \r\ndie  Plane  des  alten  und  neuen  Roms  bekannt,  betrachte \r\ndie  Ruinen,  die  Gebäude,  besuche  ein  und  die  andere \r\nVilla;  die  grüßten  Merkwürdigkeiten  werden  ganz  lang- \r\nsam behandelt,  ich  tue  nur  die  Augen  auf  und  seh  und \r\ngeh  und  komme  wieder:  denn  man  kann  sich  nur  in  Rom \r\nauf  Rom  vorbereiten. \r\n\r\nGestehen  wir  jedoch,  es  ist  ein  saures  und  trauriges  Ge- \r\nschäft, das  alte  Rom  aus  dem  neuen  herauszuklauben, \r\naber  man  muß  es  denn  doch  tun  und  zuletzt  eine  un- \r\nschätzbare Befriedigung  hoften.  Man  trifft  Spuren  einer \r\nHerrlichkeit  und  einer  Zerstörung,  die  beide  über  unsere \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  137 \r\n\r\nBegrifte  gehen.  Was  die  Barbaren  stehen  ließen,  haben \r\ndie  Baumeister  des  neuen  Roms  verwüstet. \r\nWenn  man  so  eine  Existenz  ansieht,  die  zweitausend \r\nJahre  und  darüber  alt  ist,  durch  den  Wechsel  der  Zeiten \r\nso  mannigfaltig  und  vom  Grund  aus  verändert,  und  doch \r\nnoch  derselbe  Boden,  derselbe  Berg,  ja  oft  dieselbe  Säule \r\nund  Mauer,  und  im  Volke  noch  die  Spuren  des  alten \r\nCharakters,  so  wird  man  ein  Mitgenosse  der  großen  Rat- \r\nschlüsse des  Schicksals,  und  so  wird  es  dem  Betrachter \r\nvon  Anfang  schwer  zu  entwickeln,  wie  Rom  auf  Rom \r\nfolgt,  und  nicht  allein  das  neue  auf  das  alte,  sondern  die \r\nverschiedenen  Epochen  des  alten  und  neuen  selbst  auf- \r\neinander. Ich  suche  niu-  erst  selbst  die  halbverdeckten \r\nPunkte  herauszufühlen,  dann  lassen  sich  erst  die  schönen \r\nVorarbeiten  recht  vollständig  nutzen;  demi  seit  dem  fünf- \r\nzehnten Jahrhundert  bis  auf  unsere  Tage  haben  sich  treff- \r\nliche Künstler  und  Gelehrte  mit  diesen  Gegenständen  ihr \r\nganzes  Leben  durch  beschäftigt. \r\n\r\nUnd  dieses  Ungeheuere  wirkt  ganz  ruhig  auf  uns  ein, \r\nwenn  wir  in  Rom  hin  und  her  eilen,  um  zu  den  höchsten \r\nGegenständen  zu  gelangen.  Anderer  Orten  muß  man  das \r\nBedeutende  aufsuchen,  hier  werden  wir  davon  überdrängt \r\nund  überfüllt.  Wie  man  geht  und  steht,  zeigt  sich  ein \r\nlandschaftliches  Bild  aller  Art  und  Weise,  Paläste  und \r\nRuinen,  Gärten  und  Wildnis,  Fernen  und  Engen,  Häus- \r\nchen, Ställe,  Triumphbögen  und  Säulen,  oft  alles  zu- \r\nsammen so  nah,  daß  es  auf  ein  Blatt  gebracht  werden \r\nkönnte.  Man  müßte  mit  tausend  Griffeln  schreiben;  was \r\nsoll  hier  eine  Feder!  Und  dann  ist  man  abends  müde \r\nund  erschöpft  vom  Schauen  und  Staunen. \r\n\r\nDen  y.  November. \r\nVerzeihen  mir  jedoch  meine  Freunde,  wenn  ich  künftig \r\nwortkarg  erfunden  werde.  Während  eines  Reisezugs  rafft \r\nman  unterwegs  auf,  was  man  kann;  jeder  Tag  bringt  etwas \r\nNeues,  und  man  eilt  auch  darüber  zu  denken  und  zu \r\nurteilen.  Hier  aber  kömmt  man  in  eine  gar  große  Schule, \r\nwo  ein  Tag  so  viel  sagt,  daß  man  von  dem  Tage  nichts \r\nzu  sagen  wagen  darf.     Ja  man  täte  wohl,    wenn    man. \r\n\r\n\r\n138  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\njahrelang  hier  verweilend,  ein  Pythagoreisches  Still- \r\nschweigen beobachtete. \r\n\r\nAn  demselbeji. \r\n\r\nIch  bin  recht  wohl.  Das  Wetter  ist,  wie  die  Römer  sagen, \r\nbrutto:  es  geht  ein  Mittagwind,  Scirocco,  der  täglich  mehr \r\noder  weniger  Regen  herbeiführt;  ich  kann  aber  diese \r\nWitterung  nicht  unangenehm  finden:  es  ist  warm  dabei, \r\nwie  es  bei  uns  im  Sommer  regnichte  Tage  nicht  sind. \r\n\r\nTischbeins  Talente,  so  wie  seine  VorScätze  und  Kunst- \r\nabsichten, lerne  ich  nun  immer  mehr  kennen  und  schätzen. \r\nEr  legte  mir  seine  Zeichnungen  und  Skizzen  vor,  welche \r\nsehr  viel  Gutes  geben  und  verkünden.  Durch  den  Auf- \r\nenthalt bei  Bodmer  sind  seine  Gedanken  auf  die  ersten \r\nZeiten  des  menschlichen  Geschlechts  geführt  worden,  da, \r\nwo  es  sich  auf  die  Erde  gesetzt  fand  und  die  Aufgabe \r\nlösen  sollte,  Herr  der  Welt  zu  werden. \r\nAls  geistreiche  Einleitung  zu  dem  Ganzen  bestrebte  er  sich, \r\ndas  hohe  Alter  der  Welt  sinnlich  darzustellen.  Berge  mit \r\nherrlichen  Wäldern  bewachsen,  Schluchten  von  Wasser- \r\nbächen ausgerissen,  ausgebrannte  Vulkane,  kaum  noch \r\nleise  dampfend.  Im  Vordergrund  ein  mächtiger,  in  der \r\nErde  übriggebliebener  Stock  eines  vieljährigen  Eich- \r\nbaums, an  dessen  halbentblößten  Wurzeln  ein  Hirsch  die \r\nStärke  seines  Geweihes  versucht,  so  gut  gedacht  als  lieb- \r\nlich ausgeführt. \r\n\r\nDann  hat  er  auf  einem  höchst  merkwürdigen  Blatte  den \r\nMann  zugleich  als  Pferdebändiger  und  allen  Tieren  der \r\nErde,  der  Luft  und  des  Wassers,  wo  nicht  an  Stärke, \r\ndoch  an  List  überlegen  dargestellt.  Die  Komposition  ist \r\naußerordentlich  schön;  als  Ölbild  müßte  es  eine  gi-oße \r\nWirkung  tun.  Eine  Zeichnung  davon  müssen  wir  not- \r\nwendig in  Weimar  besitzen.  Sodann  denkt  er  an  eine \r\nVersammlung  der  alten,  weisen  und  geprüften  Männer, \r\nwo  er  Gelegenheit  nehmen  wird,  wirkliche  Gestalten \r\ndarzustellen.  Mit  dem  größten  Enthusiasmus  aber  skiz- \r\nziert er  an  einer  Schlacht,  wo  sich  zwei  Parteien  Reiterei \r\nwechselseitig  mit  gleicher  Wut  angreifen,  und  zwar  an \r\neiner  Stelle,  wo  eine  ungeheuere  Felsschlucht  sie  trennt. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  139 \r\n\r\nüber  welche  das  Pferd  nur  mit  größter  Anstrengung  hin- \r\nübersetzen kann.  An  Verteidigung  ist  hier  nicht  zu  denken. \r\nKühner  Angriff,  wilder  Entschluß,  Gelingen  oder  Sturz \r\nin  den  Abgrund.  Dieses  Bild  wird  ihm  Gelegenheit  geben, \r\ndie  Kenntnisse,  die  er  von  dem  Pferde,  dessen  Bau  und \r\nBewegung  besitzt,  auf  eine  sehr  bedeutende  Weise  zu \r\nentfalten. \r\n\r\nDiese  Bilder  sodann  und  eine  Reihe  von  folgenden  und \r\neingeschalteten  wünscht  er  durch  ein  Gedicht  verknüpft, \r\nwelches  dem  Dargestellten  zur  Erklärung  diente,  und  ihm \r\ndagegen  wieder  durch  bestimmte  Gestalten  Körper  und \r\nReiz  verliehe. \r\n\r\nDer  Gedanke  ist  schön;  nur  müßte  man  freilich  mehrere \r\nJahre  zusammen  sein,  um  ein  solches  Werk  auszuführen. \r\n\r\nDie  Logen  von  Raffael  und  die  großen  Gemälde  der \r\nSchule  von  Athen  usw.  hab  ich  nur  erst  einmal  gesehen, \r\nund  da  ist's,  als  wenn  man  den  Homer  aus  einer  zum \r\nTeil  verloschenen,  beschädigten  Handschrift  herausstu- \r\ndieren sollte.  Das  Vergnügen  des  ersten  Eindrucks  ist \r\nunvollkommen;  nur  wenn  man  nach  und  nach  alles  recht \r\ndurchgesehn  und  studiert  hat,  wird  der  Genuß  ganz. \r\nAm  erhaltensten  sind  die  Deckenstücke  der  Logen,  die \r\nbiblische  Geschichten  vorstellen,  so  frisch  wie  gestern \r\ngemalt,  zwar  die  wenigsten  von  Raffaels  eigner  Hand, \r\ndoch  aber  gar  trefflich  nach  seinen  Zeichnungen  und \r\nunter  seiner  Aufsicht. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  manchmal  in  früherer  Zeit  die  wunderliche  Grille \r\ngehabt,  daß  ich  mir  sehnlichst  wünschte,  von  einem  wohl- \r\nunterrichteten Manne,  von  einem  kunst-  und  geschichts- \r\nkundigen  Engländer  nach  Italien  geführt  zu  werden;  und \r\nnun  hat  sich  das  alles  indessen  schöner  gebildet,  als  ich \r\nhätte  ahnen  können.  Tischbein  lebte  so  lange  hier,  als \r\nmein  herzlicher  Freund,  er  lebte  hier  mit  dem  Wunsche, \r\nmir  Rom  zu  zeigen;  unser  Verhältnis  ist  alt  durch  Briefe, \r\nneu  durch  Gegenwart:  wo  hätte  mir  ein  werterer  Führer \r\nerscheinen  können?  Ist  auch  meine  Zeit  nur  beschränkt, \r\nso  werde  ich  doch  das  Möglichste  genießen  und  lernen. \r\n\r\n\r\nI40  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nUnd  bei  allem  dem  seh  ich  voraus,  daß  ich  wünschen \r\nwerde,  anzukommen,  wenn  ich  weggehe. \r\n\r\nDeJi  8.  November. \r\nMein  wunderliches  und  vielleicht  grillenhaftes  Halbin- \r\nkognito bringt  mir  Vorteile,  an  die  ich  nicht  denken \r\nkonnte.  Da  sich  jedermann  verpflichtet,  zu  ignorieren, \r\nwer  ich  sei,  und  also  auch  niemand  mit  mir  von  mir \r\nreden  darf,  so  bleibt  den  Menschen  nichts  übrig,  als  von \r\nsich  selbst  oder  von  Gegenständen  zu  sprechen,  die  ihnen \r\ninteressant  sind;  dadurch  erfahr  ich  nun  umständlich,  wo- \r\nmit sich  ein  jeder  beschäftigt  oder  was  irgend  Merkwür- \r\ndiges entsteht  und  hervorgeht.  Hofrat  Reiffenstein  fand \r\nsich  auch  in  diese  Grille;  da  er  aber  den  Namen,  den  ich \r\nangenommen  hatte,  aus  einer  besondern  Ursache  nicht \r\nleiden  konnte,  so  baronisierte  er  mich  geschwind,  und  ich \r\nheiße  nun  der  Baron  gegen  Rondanini  über;  dadurch  bin \r\nich  bezeichnet  genug,  um  so  inehr,  als  der  Italiener  die \r\nMenschen  nur  nach  den  Vornamen  oder  Spitznamen  be- \r\nnennet. Genug,  ich  habe  meinen  Willen  und  entgehe \r\nder  unendlichen  Unbequemlichkeit,  von  mir  und  meinen \r\nArbeiten  Rechenschaft  geben  zu  müssen \r\n\r\nDen  p.  N^ovember. \r\n\r\nManchmal  stehe  ich  wie  einen  Augenblick  still  und  über- \r\nschaue die  höchsten  Gipfel  des  schon  Gewonnenen.  Sehr \r\ngerne  blicke  ich  nach  Venedig  zurück,  auf  jenes  große \r\nDasein,  dem  Schöße  des  Meeres,  wie  Pallas  aus  dem \r\nHaupte  Jupiters,  entsprossen.  Hier  hat  mich  dieRotonda, \r\nso  die  äußere  wie  die  innere,  zu  einer  freudigen  Ver- \r\nehrung ihrer  Großheit  bewogen.  In  St.  Peter  habe  ich \r\nbegreifen  lernen,  wie  die  Kunst  sowohl  als  die  Natur \r\nalle  Maßvergleichung  aufheben  kann.  Und  so  hat  mich \r\nApoll  von  Belvedere  aus  der  Wirklichkeit  hinausgerückt. \r\nDenn  wie  von  jenen  Gebäuden  die  richtigsten  Zeich- \r\nnungen keinen  Pjegriff  geben,  so  ist  es  hier  mit  dem  Ori- \r\nginal von  Marmor  gegen  die  Gipsabgüsse,  deren  ich  doch \r\nsehr  schöne  früher  gekannt  habe. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  141 \r\n\r\nDen  10.  November. \r\nIch  lebe  nun  hier  mit  einer  Klarheit  und  Ruhe,  von  der \r\nich  lange  kein  Gefühl  hatte.  Meine  Übung,  alle  Dinge, \r\nwie  sie  sind,  zu  sehen  und  abzulesen,  meine  Treue,  das \r\nAuge  Licht  sein  zu  lassen,  meine  völlige  Entäußrung  von \r\naller  Prätention  kommen  mir  einmal  wieder  recht  zu- \r\nstatten und  machen  mich  im  stillen  höchst  glücklich.  Alle \r\nTage  ein  neuer  merkwürdiger  Gegenstand,  täglich  frische, \r\ngroße,  seltsame  Bilder  und  ein  Ganzes,  das  man  sich \r\nlange  denkt  und  träumt,  nie  mit  der  Einbildungskraft \r\nerreicht. \r\n\r\nHeute  war  ich  bei  der  Pyramide  des  Cestius  und  abends \r\nauf  dem  Palatin,  oben  auf  den  Ruinen  der  Kaiserpaläste, \r\ndie  wie  Felsenwände  dastehn.  Hievon  läßt  sich  nun \r\nfreilich  nichts  überliefern!  Wahrlich,  es  gibt  hier  nichts \r\nKleines,  wenn  auch  wohl  hier  und  da  etwas  Scheltens- \r\nwertes  und  Abgeschmacktes;  doch  auch  ein  solches  hat \r\nteil  an  der  allgemeinen  Großheit  genommen. \r\nKehr  ich  nun  in  mich  selbst  zurück,  wie  man  doch  so \r\ngern  tut  bei  jeder  Gelegenheit,  so  entdecke  ich  ein  Ge- \r\nfühl, das  mich  unendlich  freut,  ja  das  ich  sogar  auszu- \r\nsprechen wage.  Wer  sich  mit  Ernst  hier  umsieht  und \r\nAugen  hat,  zu  sehen,  muß  solid  werden,  er  muß  einen \r\nBegriff  von  Solidität  fassen,  der  ihm  nie  so  lebendig \r\nward. \r\n\r\nDer  Geist  wird  zur  Tüchtigkeit  gestempelt,  gelangt  zu \r\neinem  Ernst  ohne  Trockenheit,  zu  einem  gesetzten  Wesen \r\nmit  Freude.  Mir  wenigstens  ist  es,  als  wenn  ich  die \r\nDinge  dieser  Welt  nie  so  richtig  geschätzt  hätte  als  hier. \r\nIch  freue  mich  der  gesegneten  Folgen  auf  mein  ganzes \r\nLeben. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  laßt  mich  aufraffen,  wie  es  kommen  will;  die \r\nOrdnung  wird  sich  geben.  Ich  bin  nicht  hier,  um  nach \r\nmeiner  Art  zu  genießen;  befleißigen  will  ich  mich  der \r\ngroßen  Gegenstände,  lernen  und  mich  ausbilden,  ehe  ich \r\nvierzig  Jahr  alt  werde. \r\n\r\nDen  II.  Nove)nher. \r\nHeut   hab   ich   die  Nymphe  Egeria    besucht,   dann  die \r\n\r\n\r\n142  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nRennbahn  des  Caracalla,  die  zerstörten  Grabstätten  längs \r\nder  Via  Appia  und  das  Grab  der  INIetella,  das  einem  erst \r\neinen  Begriff  von  solidem  Mauerwerk  gibt.  Diese  Men- \r\nschen arbeiteten  für  die  Ewigkeit:  es  war  auf  alles  kalku- \r\nliert, nur  auf  den  Unsinn  der  Verwüster  nicht,  dem  alles \r\nweichen  mußte.  Recht  sehnlich  habe  ich  dich  herzuge- \r\nwünscht. Die  Reste  der  großen  Wasserleitung  sind  höchst \r\nehrwürdig.  Der  schöne  große  Zweck,  ein  Volk  zu  tränken \r\ndurch  eine  so  ungeheure  Anstalt!  Abends  kamen  wir \r\nans  Coliseo,  da  es  schon  dämmrig  war.  Wenn  man  das \r\nansieht,  scheint  wieder  alles  andre  klein:  es  ist  so  groß, \r\ndaß  man  das  Bild  nicht  in  der  Seele  behalten  kann;  man \r\nerinnert  sich  dessen  nur  kleiner  wieder,  und  kehrt  man \r\ndahin  zurück,  kommt  es  einem  aufs  neue  größer  vor. \r\n\r\nFrascati,  den  15.  Ncrocmhcr. \r\nDie  Gesellschaft  ist  zu  Bette,  und  ich  schreibe  noch  aus \r\nder  Tuschmuschel,  aus  welcher  gezeichnet  worden  ist. \r\nWir  haben  ein  paar  schöne,  regenfreie  Tage  hier  gehabt, \r\nwarm  und  freundlichen  Sonnenschein,  daß  man  den  Som- \r\nmer nicht  vermißt.  Die  Gegend  ist  sehr  angenehm;  der \r\nOrt  liegt  auf  einem  Hügel,  vielmehr  an  einem  Berge,  und \r\njeder  Schritt  bietet  dem  Zeichner  die  herrlichsten  Gegen- \r\nstände. Die  Aussicht  ist  unbegi-enzt:  man  sieht  Rom \r\nliegen  und  weiter  die  See,  an  der  rechten  Seite  die  Ge- \r\nbirge von  Tivoli  und  so  fort.  In  dieser  lustigen  Gegend \r\nsind  Landhäuser  recht  zur  Lust  angelegt,  und  wie  die \r\nalten  Römer  schon  hier  ihre  Villen  hatten,  so  haben  vor \r\nhundert  Jahren  und  mehr  reiche  und  übermütige  Römer \r\nihre  Landhäuser  auch  auf  die  schönsten  Flecke  gepflanzt. \r\nZwei  Tage  gehn  wir  schon  hier  herum,  und  es  ist  immer \r\netwas  Neues  und  Reizendes. \r\n\r\nUnd  doch  läßt  sich  kaum  sagen,  ob  nicht  die  Abende  noch \r\nvergnügter  als  der  Tag  hingehen.  Sobald  die  stattliche \r\n\\Virtin  die  messingene  dreiarmige  Lampe  auf  den  großen \r\nrunden  Tisch  gesetzt  und  Felicissima  notte!  gesagt  hat, \r\nversammelt  sich  alles  im  Kreise  und  legt  die  Blätter  vor, \r\nwelche  den  Tag  über  gezeichnet  und  skizziert  worden. \r\nDarüber  spricht  man,  ob  der  Gegenstand  hätte  günstiger \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  143 \r\n\r\naufgenommen  werden  sollen,  ob  der  Charakter  getroffen \r\nist,  und  was  solche  erste  allgemeine  Fordernisse  sind, \r\nwovon  man  sich  schon  bei  dem  ersten  Entwurf  Rechen- \r\nschaft geben  kann.  Hofrat  Reiffenstein  weiß  diese  Sit- \r\nzungen durch  seine  Einsicht  und  Autorität  zu  ordnen  und \r\nzu  leiten.  Diese  löbliche  Anstalt  aber  schreibt  sich  eigent- \r\nlich von  Philipp  Hackert  her,  welcher  höchst  geschmack- \r\nvoll die  wirklichen  Aussichten  zu  zeichnen  und  auszu- \r\nführen wußte.  Künstler  und  Liebhaber,  Männer  und \r\nFrauen,  Alte  und  Junge  ließ  er  nicht  ruhen;  er  munterte \r\njeden  auf,  nach  seinen  Gaben  und  Kräften  sich  gleich- \r\nfalls zu  versuchen,  und  ging  mit  gutem  Beispiel  vor.  Diese \r\nArt,  eine  Gesellschaft  zu  versammeln  und  zu  unterhalten, \r\nhat  Hofrat  Reiffenstein  nach  der  Abreise  jenes  Freundes \r\ntreulich  fortgesetzt,  und  wir  finden,  wie  löblich  es  sei, \r\nden  tätigen  Anteil  eines  jeden  zu  wecken.  Die  Natur \r\nund  Eigenschaft  der  verschiedenen  Gesellschaftsglieder \r\ntritt  auf  eine  anmutige  Weise  hervor.  Tischbein  zum \r\nBeispiel  sieht  als  Historienmaler  die  Landschaft  ganz \r\nanders  an  als  der  Landschaftszeichner.  Er  findet  bedeu- \r\ntende Gruppen  und  andere  anmutige  vielsagende  Gegen- \r\nstände da,  wo  ein  anderer  nichts  gewahr  würde,  und  so \r\nglückt  es  ihm  auch  manchen  menschlichen  naiven  Zug \r\nzu  erhaschen,  es  sei  nun  an  Kindern,  Landleuten,  Bett- \r\nlern und  andern  dergleichen  Naturmenschen,  oder  auch \r\nan  Tieren,  die  er  mit  wenigen  charakteristischen  Strichen \r\ngar  glücklich  darzustellen  weiß  und  dadurch  der  Unter- \r\nhaltung immer  neuen  angenehmen  Stoff  unterlegt. \r\nWill  das  Gespräch  ausgehen,  so  wird,  gleichfalls  nach \r\nHackerts  Vermächtnis,  in  Sulzers  Theorie  gelesen,  und \r\nwenn  man  gleich,  von  einem  höhern  Standpunkte,  mit \r\ndiesem  Werke  nicht  ganz  zufrieden  sein  kann,  so  bemerkt \r\nman  doch  mit  Vergnügen  den  guten  Einfluß  auf  Personen, \r\ndie  auf  einer  mittlem  Stufe  der  Bildung  stehen. \r\n\r\nRom,  den  ly.  JVovember. \r\nWir  sind  zurück!  Heute  nacht  fiel  ein  entsetzlicher  Regen- \r\nguß, mit  Donner  und  Blitzen;  nun  regnet  es  fort  und  ist \r\nimmer  warm  dabei. \r\n\r\n\r\n144  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nIch  aber  kann  nur  mit  wenig  Worten  das  Glück  dieses \r\nTages  bezeichnen.  Ich  habe  die  Freskogemälde  von \r\nDominichin  in  Andrea  della  Valle,  ingleichen  die  Farne- \r\nsische Galerie  von  Carraccio  gesehen.  Freilich  zu  viel \r\nfür  Monate,  geschweige  für  einen  Tag. \r\n\r\nDen  i8.  N'ovcmber. \r\nEs  ist  wieder  schön  Wetter,  ein  heller,  freundlicher, \r\nwarmer  Tag. \r\n\r\nIch  sah  in  der  Farnesina  die  Geschichte  der  Psyche,  deren \r\nfarbige  Nachbildungen  so  lange  meine  Zimmer  erheitern, \r\ndann  zu  St.  Peter  in  Montorio  die  Verklärung  von  Raf- \r\nfael.  Alles  alte  Bekannte,  wie  Freunde,  die  man  sich \r\nin  der  Ferne  durch  Briefwechsel  gemacht  hat  und  die \r\nman  nun  von  Angesicht  sieht.  Das  Mitleben  ist  doch \r\nganz  was  anders,  jedes  wahre  Verhältnis  und  Mißver- \r\nhältnis spricht  sich  sogleich  aus. \r\n\r\nAuch  finden  sich  aller  Orten  und  Enden  herrliche  Sachen, \r\nvon  denen  nicht  so  viel  Redens  ist,  die  nicht  so  oft  durch \r\nKupfer  und  Nachbildungen  in  die  Welt  gestreut  sind. \r\nHievon  bringe  ich  manches  mit,  gezeichnet  von  guten \r\njungen  Künstlern. \r\n\r\nDaß  ich  mit  Tischbein  schon  so  lange  durch  Briefe  in \r\ndem  besten  Verhältnis  stehe,  daß  ich  ihm  so  manchen \r\nWunsch,  sogar  ohne  Hoffnung,  nach  Italien  zu  kommen, \r\nmitgeteilt,  machte  unser  Zusammentreffen  sogleich  frucht- \r\nbar und  erfreulich.  Er  hatte  immer  an  mich  gedacht  und \r\nfür  mich  gesorgt.  Auch  was  die  Steine  betrifft,  mit  wel- \r\nchen die  Alten  und  Neuen  gebaut,  ist  er  vollkommen  zu \r\nHause;  er  hat  sie  recht  gründlich  studiert,  wobei  ihm  sein \r\nKünstlerauge  und  die  Künstlerlust  an  sinnlichen  Dingen \r\nsehr  zustatten  kommt.  Eine  für  mich  ausgewählte  Samm- \r\nlung von  Musterstücken  hat  er  vor  kurzem  nach  Weimar \r\nabgesendet,  die  mich  bei  meiner  Zurückkunft  freundlich \r\nempfangen  soll.  Ein  bedeutender  Nachtrag  hat  sich  in- \r\ndessen gefunden.  Ein  Geistlicher,  der  sich  jetzt  in  Frank- \r\nreich aufhält  und  über  die  antiken  Steinarten  ein  Werk \r\nauszuarbeiten  dachte,  erhielt  durch  die  Gunst  der  Propa- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  145 \r\n\r\ngande  ansehnliche  Stücke  Marmor  von  der  Insel  Faros. \r\nDiese  wurden  hier  zu  Musterstücken  verschnitten  und \r\nzwölf  verschiedene  Stücke  auch  für  mich  beiseite  gelegt. \r\nvom  feinsten  bis  zum  gröbsten  Korn,  von  der  größten \r\nReinheit  und  dann  minder  und  mehr  mit  Glimmer  ge- \r\nmischt, jene  zur  Bildhauerei,  diese  zur  Architektur  an- \r\nwendbar. Wie  viel  eine  genaue  Kenntnis  des  Materials, \r\nworin  die  Künste  gearbeitet,  zu  ihrer  Beurteilung  hilft, \r\nfällt  genugsam  in  die  Augen. \r\n\r\nGelegenheit  gibt's  genug,  dergleichen  hier  zusammen- \r\nzuschleppen. Auf  den  Ruinen  des  Neronischen  Palastes \r\ngingen  wir  durch  frisch  aufgehäufelte  Artischockenländer \r\nund  konnten  uns  nicht  enthalten,  die  Taschen  vollzu- \r\nstecken von  Granit-,  Porphyr-  und  Marmortäfelchen,  die \r\nzu  Tausenden  hier  herum  liegen  und  von  der  alten  Herr- \r\nlichkeit der  damit  überkleideten  Wände  noch  als  uner- \r\nschöpfliche Zeugen  gelten. \r\n\r\nZum  18.  November. \r\nNun  muß  ich  aber  auch  von  einem  wunderbaren  proble- \r\nmatischen Bilde  sprechen,  das  sich  auf  jene  trefflichen \r\nDinge  noch  immer  gut  sehen  läßt. \r\n\r\nSchon  vor  mehreren  Jahren  hielt  sich  hier  ein  Franzos \r\nauf,  als  Liebhaber  der  Kunst  und  Sammler  bekannt.  Er \r\nkommt  zum  Besitz  eines  antiken  Gemäldes  auf  Kalk, \r\nniemand  weiß  woher;  er  läßt  das  Bild  durch  Mengs \r\nrestaurieren  und  hat  es  als  ein  geschätztes  Werk  in  seiner \r\nSammlung.  Winckelmann  spricht  irgendwo  mit  Enthu- \r\nsiasmus davon.  Es  stellt  den  Ganymed  vor,  der  dem \r\nJupiter  eine  Schale  Wein  reicht  und  dagegen  einen  Kuß \r\nempfängt.  Der  Franzose  stirbt  und  hinterläßt  das  Bild \r\nseiner  Wirtin  als  a7itik.  Mengs  stirbt  und  sagt  auf \r\nseinem  Todbette:  1?^  sei  nicht  antik,  er  habe  es  gemalt. \r\nUnd  nun  streitet  alles  gegeneinander.  Der  eine  be- \r\nhauptet, es  sei  von  Mengs  zum  Scherz  nur  so  leicht  hin- \r\ngemacht; der  andere  Teil  sagt,  Mengs  habe  nie  so  etwas \r\nmachen  können,  ja  es  sei  beinahe  für  Raffael  zu  schön. \r\nIch  habe  es  gestern  gesehn  und  muß  sagen,  daß  ich  auch \r\nnichts  Schöneres  kenne  als  die  Figur  Ganymeds,  Kopf \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  10 \r\n\r\n\r\n146  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nund  Rücken;  das  andere  ist  viel  restauriert.  Indessen \r\nist  das  Bild  diskreditiert,  und  die  arme  Frau  will  niemand \r\nvon  dem  Schatz  erlösen. \r\n\r\nDai  20.  Noi'ember. \r\nDa  uns  die  Erfahrung  genugsam  belehrt,  daß  man  zu  Ge- \r\ndichten jeder  Art  Zeichnungen  und  Kupfer  wünscht,  ja \r\nder  Maler  selbst  seine  ausführlichsten  Bilder  der  Stelle \r\nirgend  eines  Dichters  widmet,  so  ist  Tischbeins  Gedanke \r\nhöchst  beifallswürdig,  daß  Dichter  und  Künstler  zu- \r\nsammen arbeiten  sollten,  um  gleich  vom  Ursprünge  her- \r\nauf eine  Einheit  zu  bilden.  Die  Schwierigkeit  würde  um \r\nvieles  freilich  vermindert,  wenn  es  kleine  Gedichte  wären, \r\ndie  sich  leicht  übersehen  und  fördern  ließen. \r\nTischbein  hat  auch  hiezu  sehr  angenehme  idyllische  Ge- \r\ndanken, und  es  ist  wirklich  sonderbar,  daß  die  Gegen- \r\nstände, die  er  auf  diese  Weise  bearbeitet  wünscht,  von \r\nder  Art  sind,  daß  weder  dichtende  noch  bildende  Kunst, \r\njede  für  sich,  zur  Darstellung  hinreichend  wären.  Er  hat \r\nmir  davon  auf  unsern  Spaziergängen  erzählt,  um  mir  Lust \r\nzu  machen,  daß  ich  mich  darauf  einlassen  möge.  Das  Titel- \r\nkupfer zu  unserm  gemeinsamen  Werke  ist  schon  entwor- \r\nfen; fürchtete  ich  mich  nicht,  in  etwas  Neues  einzugehen, \r\nso  könnte  ich  mich  wohl  verführen  lassen. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  November^  am  Cäciliettfeste. \r\nDas  Andenken  dieses  glücklichen  Tages  muß  ich  durch \r\neinige  Zeilen  lebhaft  erhalten  und,  was  ich  genossen, \r\nwenigstens  historisch  mitteilen.  Es  war  das  schönste, \r\nruhigste  Wetter,  ein  ganz  heiterer  Himmel  und  warme \r\nSonne.  Ich  ging  mit  Tischbein  nach  dem  Petersplatze, \r\nwo  wir  erst  auf  und  ab  gehend  und,  wenn  es  uns  zu  warm \r\nwurde,  im  Schatten  des  großen  Obelisks,  der  eben  für \r\nzwei  breit  genug  geworfen  wird,  spazierten  und  Trauben \r\nverzehrten,  die  wir  in  der  Nähe  gekauft  hatten.  Dann \r\ngingen  wir  in  die  Sixtinische  Kapelle,  die  wir  auch  hell \r\nund  heiter,  die  Gemälde  wohl  erleuchtet  fanden.  Das \r\nJüngste  Gericht  und  die  mannigfaltigen  Gemälde  der \r\nDecke  von  Michel  Angelo  teilten  unsere  Bewunderung. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  147 \r\n\r\nIch  konnte  nur  sehen  und  anstaunen.  Die  innere  Sicher- \r\nheit und  MännUchkeit  des  Meisters,  seine  Großheit  geht \r\nüber  allen  Ausdruck.  Nachdem  wir  alles  wieder  und \r\nwieder  gesehn,  verließen  wir  dieses  Heiligtum  und  gingen \r\nnach  der  Peterskirche,  die  von  dem  heitern  Himmel  das \r\nschönste  Licht  empfing  und  in  allen  Teilen  hell  und  klar \r\nerschien.  Wir  ergötzten  uns  als  genießende  Menschen \r\nan  der  Größe  und  der  Pracht,  ohne  durch  allzu  eklen  und \r\nzu  verständigen  Geschmack  uns  diesmal  irre  machen  zu \r\nlassen,  und  unterdrückten  jedes  schärfere  Urteil.  Wir \r\nerfreuten  uns  des  Erfreulichen. \r\n\r\nEndhch  bestiegen  wir  das  Dach  der  Kirche,  wo  man  das \r\nBild  einer  wohlgebauten  Stadt  im  kleinen  findet.  Häuser \r\nund  Magazine,  Brunnen,  (dem  Ansehn  nach)  Kirchen  und \r\neinen  großen  Tempel,  alles  in  der  Luft,  und  schöne  Spa- \r\nziergänge dazwischen.  Wir  bestiegen  die  Kuppel  und \r\nbesahen  die  hellheitere  Gegend  der  Apenninen,  den  Berg \r\nSoracte,  nach  Tivoli  die  vulkanischen  Hügel,  Frascati, \r\nCastel  Gandolfo  und  die  Plaine  und  weiter  das  Meer. \r\nNahe  vor  uns  die  ganze  Stadt  Rom,  in  ihrer  Breite  und \r\nWeite  mit  ihren  Bergpalästen,  Kuppeln  usw.  Es  rührte \r\nsich  keine  Luft,  und  in  dem  kupfernen  Knopf  war  es \r\nheiß  wie  in  einem  Treibhause.  Nachdem  wir  das  alles \r\nbeherzigt  hatten,  stiegen  wir  herab  und  ließen  uns  die \r\nTüren  zu  den  Gesimsen  der  Kuppel,  des  Tambours  und \r\ndes  Schifis  aufschließen;  man  kann  um  selbe  herumgehen \r\nund  diese  Teile  und  die  Kirche  von  oben  betrachten. \r\nAls  wir  auf  dem  Gesimse  des  Tambours  standen,  ging \r\nder  Papst  unten  in  der  Tiefe  vorbei,  seine  Nachmittags- \r\nandacht zu  halten.  Es  fehlte  uns  also  nichts  zur  Peters- \r\nkirche. Wir  stiegen  völlig  wieder  herab,  nahmen  in  einem \r\nbenachbarten  Gasthofe  ein  fröhliches,  frugales  Mahl  und \r\nsetzten  unsern  Weg  nach  der  Cäcilienkirche  fort. \r\nViele  Worte  würde  ich  brauchen,  um  die  Auszierung  der \r\nganz  mit  Menschen  angefüllten  Kirche  zu  beschreiben. \r\nMan  sah  eben  keinen  Stein  der  Architektur  mehr.  Die \r\nSäulen  waren  mit  rotem  Samt  überzogen  und  mit  goldenen \r\nTressen  umwunden.  Die  Kapitale  mit  gesticktem  Samt \r\nin  ungefährer  Kapitälform,  so  alle  Gesimse  und  Pfeiler \r\n\r\n\r\n148  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nbehangen  und  bedeckt.  Alle  Zwischenräume  der  Mauern \r\nmit  lebhaft  gemalten  Stücken  bekleidet,  daß  die  ganze \r\nKirche  mit  Mosaik  ausgelegt  schien,  und  über  zweihundert \r\nWachskerzen  brannten  um  und  neben  dem  Hochaltar,  so \r\ndaß  die  ganze  eine  Wand  mit  Lichtern  besetzt  und  das \r\nSchiff  der  Kirche  vollkommen  erleuchtet  war.  Die  Seiten- \r\ngänge und  Seitenaltäre  ebenso  geziert  und  erhellt.  Gegen \r\ndem  Hochaltar  über,  unter  der  Orgel,  zwei  Gerüste  auch \r\nmit  Samt  überzogen,  auf  deren  einem  die  Sänger,  auf \r\ndem  andern  die  Instrumenter  standen,  die  anhaltend  Musik \r\nmachten.  Die  Kirche  war  voll  gedrängt. \r\nEine  schöne  Art  musikalischer  Aufführung  hört  ich  hier. \r\nWie  man  Violin-  oder  andere  Konzerte  hat,  so  führen \r\nsie  Konzerte  mit  Stimmen  auf,  daß  die  eine  Stimme,  der \r\nSopran  zum  Beispiel,  herrschend  ist  imd  Solo  singt,  das \r\nChor  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  einfällt  und  ihn  begleitet,  es  ver- \r\nsteht sich  immer  mit  dem  ganzen  Orchester.  Es  tut  gute \r\nWirkung.  —  Ich  muß  endigen,  wie  wir  den  Tag  enden \r\nmußten.  Den  Abend  gelangten  wir  noch  ans  Opernhaus, \r\nwo  eben  die  Litiganti  aufgeführt  wurden,  und  haltendes \r\nGuten  so  viel  genossen,  daß  wir  vorübergingen. \r\n\r\nDen  2j.  November. \r\nDamit  es  mir  denn  aber  doch  mit  meinem  beliebten  In- \r\nkognito nicht  wie  dem  Vogel  Strauß  ergehe,  der  sich  für \r\nversteckt  hält,  wenn  er  den  Kopf  verbirgt,  so  gebe  ich \r\nauf  gewisse  Weise  nach,  meine  alte  These  immerfort  be- \r\nhauptend. Den  Fürsten  von  Liechtenstein,  den  Bruder \r\nder  mir  so  werten  Gräfin  Harrach,  habe  ich  gern  begrüßt \r\nund  einigemal  bei  ihm  gespeist  und  konnte  bald  merken, \r\ndaß  diese  meine  Nachgiebigkeit  mich  weiter  führen  würde; \r\nund  so  kam  es  auch.  Man  hatte  mir  von  dem  Abbate \r\nMonti  präludiert,  von  seinem  Aristodem,  einer  Tragödie, \r\ndie  nächstens  gegeben  werden  sollte.  Der  Verfasser,  sagte \r\nman,  wünsche  sie  mir  vorzulesen  und  meine  Meinung \r\ndarüber  zu  hören.  Ich  ließ  die  Sache  fallen,  ohne  sie \r\nabzulehnen,  endlich  fand  ich  einmal  den  Dichter  und \r\neinen  seiner  Freunde  beim  Fürsten,  und  das  Stück  ward \r\nvorafelesen. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  149 \r\n\r\nDer  Held  ist,  wie  bekannt,  ein  König  von  Sparta,  der \r\nsich  wegen  allerlei  Gewissensskrupel  selbst  entleibt,  und \r\nman  gab  mir  auf  eine  artige  Weise  zu  verstehen,  der  Ver- \r\nfasser des  Werthers  würde  wohl  nicht  übel  finden,  wenn \r\ner  in  diesem  Stücke  einige  Stellen  seines  trefflichen  Buches \r\nbenutzt  finde.  Und  so  konnte  ich  selbst  in  den  Mauern \r\nvon  Sparta  den  erzürnten  Manen  des  unglücklichen  Jüng- \r\nlings nicht  entgehen. \r\n\r\nDas  Stück  hat  einen  sehr  einfachen  ruhigen  Gang;  die \r\nGesinnungen  wie  die  Sprache  sind  dem  Gegenstande  ge- \r\nmäß, kräftig  und  doch  weichmütig.  Die  Arbeit  zeugt  von \r\neinem  sehr  schönen  Talente. \r\n\r\nIch  verfehlte  nicht,  nach  meiner  Weise,  freilich  nicht  nach \r\nder  italienischen,  alles  Gute  und  Lobenswürdige  des \r\nStücks  herauszuheben,  womit  man  zwar  leidlich  zufrieden \r\nwar,  aber  doch,  mit  südlicher  Ungeduld,  etwas  mehr  ver- \r\nlangte. Besonders  sollte  ich  weissagen,  was  von  dem \r\nEffekt  des  Stücks  auf  das  Publikum  zu  hoffen  sei.  Ich \r\nentschuldigte  mich  mit  meiner  Unkunde  des  Landes,  der \r\nVorstellungsart  und  des  Geschmacks,  war  aber  aufrichtig \r\ngenug,  hinzuzusetzen,  daß  ich  nicht  recht  einsehe,  wie  die \r\nverwöhnten  Römer,  die  ein  komplettes  Lustspiel  von  drei \r\nAkten  und  eine  komplette  Oper  von  zwei  Akten  als \r\nZwischenspiel  oder  eine  große  Oper  mit  ganz  fremdarti- \r\ngen Balletts  als  Intermezz  zu  sehen  gewohnt  seien,  sich \r\nan  dem  edlen,  ruhigen  Gang  einer  ununterbrochen  fort- \r\ngehenden Tragödie  ergötzen  könnten.  Alsdann  schien \r\nmir  auch  der  Gegenstand  des  Selbstmordes  ganz  außer \r\ndem  Kreise  italienischer  Begrifie  zu  liegen.  Daß  man \r\nandere  totschlage,  davon  hätte  ich  fast  Tag  für  Tag  zu \r\nhören;  daß  man  sich  aber  selbst  das  liebe  Leben  raube \r\noder  es  nur  für  möglich  hielte,  davon  sei  mir  noch  nichts \r\nvorgekommen. \r\n\r\nHieraufließ  ich  mich  gern  umständlich  unterrichten,  was \r\ngegen  meinen  Unglauben  einzuwenden  sein  möchte,  und \r\nergab  mich  sehr  gern  in  die  plausibeln  Argumente,  ver- \r\nsicherte auch,  daß  ich  nichts  mehr  wünsche,  als  das  Stück \r\naufführen  zu  sehen  und  demselben  mit  einem  Chor  von \r\nFreunden  den  aufrichtigsten  lautesten  Beifall  zu  zollen. \r\n\r\n\r\n1 5  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDiese  Erklärung  wurde  freundlichst  aufgenommen,  und \r\nich  hatte  alle  Ursache,  diesmal  mit  meiner  Nachgiebigkeit \r\nzufrieden  zu  sein;  wie  denn  Fürst  Liechtenstein  die  Ge- \r\nfälligkeit selbst  ist  und  mir  Gelegenheit  geschafft  hat,  mit \r\nihm  gar  manche  Kunstschätze  zu  sehen,  wozu  besondere \r\nErlaubnis  der  Besitzer  und  also  eine  höhere  Einwirkung \r\nnötig  ist. \r\n\r\nDagegen  aber  reichte  mein  guter  Humor  nicht  hin,  als \r\ndie  Tochter  des  Prätendenten  das  fremde  Murmeltier \r\ngleichfalls  zu  sehen  verlangte.  Das  habe  ich  abgelehnt \r\nund  bin  ganz  entschieden  wieder  untergetaucht. \r\nUnd  doch  ist  das  auch  nicht  die  ganz  rechte  Art,  und  ich \r\nfühle  hier  sehr  lebhaft,  was  ich  schon  früher  im  Leben \r\nbemerken  konnte,  daß  der  Mensch,  der  das  Gute  will, \r\nsich  ebenso  tätig  und  rührig  gegen  andere  verhalten \r\nmüsse  als  der  Eigennützige,  der  Kleine,  der  Böse.  Ein- \r\nsehen läßt  sich's  gut,  es  ist  aber  schwer  in  diesem  Sinne \r\nhandeln. \r\n\r\nDen  24.  November. \r\n\r\nVon  der  Nation  wüßte  ich  nichts  weiter  zu  sagen,  als  daß \r\nes  Naturmenschen  sind,  die  unter  Pracht  und  Würde  der \r\nReligion  und  der  Künste  nicht  ein  Haar  anders  sind,  als \r\nsie  in  Höhlen  und  Wäldern  auch  sein  würden.  Was  allen \r\nFremden  auffällt  und  was  heute  wieder  die  ganze  Stadt \r\nreden,  aber  auch  nur  reden  macht,  sind  die  Totschläge, \r\ndie  gewöhnlich  vorkommen.  Viere  sind  schon  in  unserm \r\nBezirk  in  diesen  drei  Wochen  ermordet  worden.  Heute \r\nward  ein  braver  Künstler,  Schwendimann,  ein  Schweizer, \r\nMedailleur,  der  letzte  Schüler  von  Hedlinger,  überfallen, \r\nvöllig  wie  Winckelmann.  Der  Mörder,  mit  dem  er  sich \r\nherumbalgte,  gab  ihm  an  die  zwanzig  Stiche,  und  da  die \r\nWache  hinzukam,  erstach  sich  der  Bösewicht  selbst.  Das \r\nist  sonst  hier  nicht  Mode.  Der  Mörder  erreicht  eine \r\nKirche,  und  so  ist's  gut. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  sollte  ich  denn,  um  auch  Schatten  in  meine  Ge- \r\nmälde zu  bringen,  von  Verbrechen  und  Unheil,  Erdbeben \r\nund  Wasserflut  einiges  melden;  doch  setzt  das  gegen- \r\nwärtisre  Ausbrechen  des  Feuers  des  Vesuvs  die  meisten \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  151 \r\n\r\nFremden  hier  in  Bewegung,  und  man  muß  sich  Gewalt \r\nantun,  um  nicht  mit  fortgerissen  zu  werden.  Diese  Natur- \r\nerscheinung hat  wirklich  etwas  Klapperschlangenartiges \r\nund  zieht  die  Menschen  unwiderstehlich  an.  Es  ist  in \r\ndem  Augenblick,  als  wenn  alle  Kunstschätze  Roms  zu- \r\nnichte würden,  die  sämtlichen  Fremden  durchbrechenden \r\nLauf  ihrer  Betrachtungen  und  eilen  nach  Neapel.  Ich \r\naber  will  ausharren,  in  Hoftnung,  daß  der  Berg  noch \r\netwas  für  mich  aufheben  wird. \r\n\r\nDen  I.  Dezember. \r\nMoritz  ist  hier,  der  uns  durch  Anton  Reiser  und  die \r\nWanderungen  nach  England  merkwürdig  geworden.  Es \r\nist  ein  reiner  trefflicher  Mann,  an  dem  wir  viel  Freude \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nHier  in  Rom,  wo  man  so  viel  Fremde  sieht,  die  nicht \r\nalle  der  höheren  Kunst  wegen  diese  Hauptstadt  der  Welt \r\nbesuchen,  sondern  auch  wohl  auf  andere  Art  unterhalten \r\nsein  wollen,  ist  man  auf  allerlei  vorbereitet.  Es  gibt  so \r\ngewisse  Halbkünste,  welche  Handgeschicklichkeit  und \r\nHandwerkslust  verlangen,  worin  man  es  hier  sehr  weit \r\ngebracht  hat  und  die  Fremden  gern  mit  ins  Interesse \r\nzieht. \r\n\r\nDahin  gehört  die  Wachsmalerei,  die  einen  jeden,  der  sich \r\neinigermaßen  mit  Wasserfarben  abgegeben  hat,  durch \r\nihre  Vorarbeiten  und  Vorbereitungen,  sodann  zuletzt  durch \r\ndas  Einbrennen,  und  was  sonst  noch  dazu  gehört,  mecha- \r\nnisch beschäftigen  und  einen  oft  geringen  Kunstwert  diu-ch \r\ndie  Neuheit  des  Unternehmens  erhöhen  kann.  Es  gibt \r\ngeschickte  Künstler,  die  hierin  Unterricht  geben  und  unter \r\ndem  Vorwand  der  Anleitung  oft  das  Beste  bei  der  Sache \r\ntun,  so  daß  zuletzt,  wenn  das  von  Wachs  erhöhte  und \r\nglänzende  Bild  in  goldenem  Rahmen  erscheint,  die  schöne \r\nSchülerin  ganz  überrascht  von  ihrem  unbewußten  Talent \r\ndasteht. \r\n\r\nEine  andere  artige  Beschäftigung  ist:  hohlgeschnittene \r\nSteine  in  einen  feinen  Ton  abzudrucken,  welches  auch \r\nwohl  mit  Medaillen  geschieht,  wo  beide  Seiten  zugleich \r\nnachgebildet  werden. \r\n\r\n\r\n1 5  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nMehr  Geschick,  Aufmerksamkeit  und  Fleiß  erfordert  denn \r\nendlich  das  Verfertigen  der  Glaspasten  selbst.  Zu  allen \r\ndiesen  Dingen  hat  Hofrat  Reiftenstein  in  seinem  Hause, \r\noder  wenigstens  in  seinen  nächsten  Umgebungen,  die \r\nnötigen  Gerätschaften  und  Anstalten. \r\n\r\nDen  2.  Dezember. \r\nZufällig  habe  ich  hier  Archenholtzens  Italien  gefunden. \r\nWie  so  ein  Geschreibe  am  Ort  selbst  zusammenschrumpft, \r\neben  als  wenn  man  das  Büchlein  auf  Kohlen  legte,  daß \r\nes  nach  und  nach  braun  und  schwarz  würde,  die  Blätter \r\nsich  krümmten  und  in  Rauch  aufgingen.  Freilich  hat  er \r\ndie  Sachen  gesehen;  aber  um  eine  großtuige,  verachtende \r\nManier  geltend  zu  machen,  besitzt  er  viel  zu  wenig  Kennt- \r\nnisse und  stolpert  lobend  und  tadelnd. \r\n\r\nDas  schöne  warme,  ruhige  Wetter,  das  nur  manchmal \r\nvon  einigen  Regentagen  unterbrochen  wird,  ist  mir  zu \r\nEnde  Novembers  ganz  was  Neues.  Wir  gebrauchen  die \r\ngute  Zeit  in  freier  Luft,  die  böse  im  Zimmer;  ül^erall \r\nfindet  sich  etwas  zum  Freuen,  Lernen  und  Tun. \r\nAm  28.  November  kehrten  wir  zur  Sixtinischen  Kapelle \r\nzurück,  ließen  die  Galerie  aufschließen,  wo  man  den \r\nPlafond  näher  sehen  kann;  man  drängt  sich  zwar,  da  sie \r\nsehr  eng  ist,  mit  einiger  Beschwerlichkeit  und  mit  an- \r\nscheinender Gefahr  an  den  eisernen  Stäben  weg,  des- \r\nwegen auch  die  Schwindligen  zurückbleiben;  alles  wird \r\naber  durch  den  Anblick  des  größten  Meisterstücks  ersetzt. \r\nUnd  ich  bin  in  dem  Augenblicke  so  für  Michel  Angelo \r\neingenommen,  daß  mir  nicht  einmal  die  Natur  auf  ihn \r\nschmeckt,  da  ich  sie  doch  nicht  mit  so  großen  Augen  wie \r\ner  sehen  kann.  Wäre  nur  ein  Mittel,  sich  solche  Bilder \r\nin  der  Seele  recht  zu  fixieren.  Wenigstens,  was  ich  von \r\nKupfern  und  Zeichnungen  nach  ihm  erobern  kann,  bring \r\nich  mit. \r\n\r\nWir  gingen  von  da  auf  die  Logen  Raffaels,  und  kaum \r\ndarf  ich  sagen,  daß  man  diese  nicht  ansehen  durfte.  Das \r\nAuge  war  von  jenen  großen  Formen  und  der  herrlichen \r\nVollendung  aller  Teile  so  ausgeweitet  und  verwöhnt,  daß \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  153 \r\n\r\nman  die  geistreichen  Spielereien  der  Arabesken  nicht \r\nansehen  mochte,  und  die  biblischen  Geschichten,  so  schön \r\nsie  sind,  hielten  auf  jene  nicht  Stich.  Diese  Werke  nun \r\nöfter  gegeneinander  zu  sehen,  mit  mehr  Muße  und  ohne \r\nVorurteil  zu  vergleichen,  muß  eine  große  Freude  ge- \r\nwähren. Denn  anfangs  ist  doch  alle  Teilnahme  nur  ein- \r\nseitig. \r\n\r\nVon  da  schlichen  wir,  fast  bei  zu  warmem  Sonnenschein, \r\nauf  die  Villa  Pamfili,  wo  sehr  schöne  Gartenpartien  sind, \r\nund  blieben  bis  an  den  Abend.  Eine  große,  mit  immer- \r\ngrünen Eichen  und  hohen  Pinien  eingefaßte  flache  Wiese \r\nwar  ganz  mit  Maßlieben  übersäet,  die  ihre  Köpfchen \r\nalle  nach  der  Sonne  wendeten;  nun  gingen  meine  bota- \r\nnischen Spekulationen  an,  denen  ich  den  andern  Tag  auf \r\neinem  Spaziergange  nach  dem  Monte  Mario,  der  Villa \r\nMelini  und  Villa  Madama  weiter  nachhing.  Es  ist  gar \r\ninteressant,  zu  bemerken,  wie  eine  lebhaft  fortgesetzte \r\nund  durch  starke  Kälte  nicht  unterbrochene  Vegetation \r\nwirkt:  hier  gibt's  keine  Knospen,  und  man  lernt  erst  be- \r\ngreifen, was  eine  Knospe  sei.  Der  Erdbeerbaum  (arbutus \r\nunedo)  blüht  jetzt  wieder,  indem  seine  letzten  Früchte \r\nreif  werden,  und  so  zeigt  sich  der  Orangenbaum  mit \r\nBlüten,  halb  und  ganz  reifen  Früchten;  doch  werden  letz- \r\ntere Bäume,  wenn  sie  nicht  zwischen  Gebäuden  stehen, \r\nnun  bedeckt.  Über  die  Zypresse,  den  respektabelsten \r\nBaum,  wenn  er  recht  alt  und  wohl  gewachsen  ist,  gibt's \r\ngenug  zu  denken.  Ehstens  werd  ich  den  botanischen \r\nGarten  besuchen  und  hoffe  da  manches  zu  erfahren.  Über- \r\nhaupt ist  mit  dem  neuen  Leben,  das  einem  nachdenken- \r\nden Menschen  die  Betrachtung  eines  neuen  Landes  ge- \r\nwährt, nichts  zu  vergleichen.  Ob  ich  gleich  noch  immer \r\nderselbe  bin,  so  mein  ich  bis  aufs  innerste  Knochen- \r\nmark verändert  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nFür  diesmal  schließ  ich  und  werde  das  nächste  Blatt \r\neinmal  ganz  von  Unheil,  Mord,  Erdbeben  und  Unglück \r\nanfüllen,  daß  doch  auch  Schatten  in  meine  Gemälde \r\nkomme. \r\n\r\n\r\n1 5  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDen  s-  Dezember. \r\nDie  Witterung  hat  bisher  meist  von  sechs  zu  sechs  Tagen \r\nabgewechselt.  Zwei  ganz  herrliche,  ein  trüber,  zwei  bis \r\ndrei  Regentage,  und  dann  wieder  schöne.  Ich  suche \r\njeden  nach  seiner  Art  aufs  beste  zu  nutzen. \r\nDoch  immer  sind  mir  noch  diese  herrlichen  Gegenstände \r\nwie  neue  Bekanntschaften.  Man  hat  nicht  mit  ihnen  ge- \r\nlebt, ihnen  ihre  Eigentümlichkeit  nicht  abgewonnen. \r\nEinige  reißen  uns  mit  Gewalt  an  sich,  daß  man  eine \r\nZeitlang  gleichgültig,  ja  ungerecht  gegen  andere  wird. \r\nSo  hat  z.  B.  das  Pantheon,  der  Apoll  von  Belvedere, \r\neinige  kolossale  Köpfe  und  neuerlich  die  Sixtinische \r\nKapelle  so  mein  Gemüt  eingenommen,  daß  ich  daneben \r\nfast  nichts  mehr  sehe.  Wie  will  man  sich  aber,  klein  wie \r\nman  ist  und  ans  Kleine  gewohnt,  diesem  Edlen,  Unge- \r\nheuren, Gebildeten  gleichstellen?  Und  wenn  man  es \r\neinigermaßen  zurechtrücken  möchte,  so  drängt  sich  aber- \r\nmals eine  ungeheure  Menge  von  allen  Seiten  zu,  begeg- \r\nnet dir  auf  jedem  Schritt,  und  jedes  fordert  für  sich  den \r\nTribut  der  Aufmerksamkeit.  Wie  will  man  sich  da  her- \r\nausziehen? Anders  nicht,  als  daß  man  es  geduldig  wirken \r\nund  wachsen  läßt  und  auch  fleißig  auf  das  merkt,  was \r\nandere  zu  unsern  Gunsten  gearbeitet  haben. \r\nWinckelmanns  Kunstgeschichte,  übersetzt  von  Fea,  die \r\nneue  Ausgabe,  ist  ein  sehr  brauchbares  Werk,  das  ich \r\ngleich  angeschaftt  habe  und  hier  am  Orte  in  guter,  aus- \r\nlegender und  belehrender  Gesellschaft  sehr  nützlich \r\nfinde. \r\n\r\nAuch  die  römischen  Altertümer  fangen  mich  an  zu  freuen. \r\nGeschichte,  Inschriften,  Münzen,  von  denen  ich  sonst \r\nnichts  wissen  mochte,  alles  drängt  sich  heran.  Wie  mir's \r\nin  der  Naturgeschichte  erginge  geht  es  auch  hier;  denn \r\nan  diesen  Ort  knüpft  sich  die  ganze  Geschichte  der  Welt \r\nan,  und  ich  zähle  einen  zweiten  Geburtstag,  eine  wahre \r\nWiedergeburt,  von  dem  Tage,  da  ich  Rom  betrat. \r\n\r\nDen  5.  Dezember. \r\nIn  den  wenigen  Wochen,  die  ich  hier  bin,  habe  ich  schon \r\nmanchen  Fremden  kommen  und  gehen  sehen  und  mich \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  155 \r\n\r\nüber  die  Leichtigkeit  verwundert,  mit  welcher  so  viele \r\ndiese  würdigen  Gegenstände  behandeln.  Gott  sei  Dank, \r\ndaß  mir  von  diesen  Zugvögeln  künftig  keiner  mehr  im- \r\nponiert, wenn  er  mir  im  Norden  von  Rom  spricht,  kei- \r\nner mir  die  Eingeweide  mehr  erregt;  denn  ich  hab's \r\ndoch  auch  gesehn  und  weiß  schon  einigermaßen,  woran \r\nich  bin. \r\n\r\nDen  8.  Dezember. \r\nWir  haben  mitunter  die  schönsten  Tage.  Der  Regen,  der \r\nvon  Zeit  zu  Zeit  fällt,  macht  Gras  und  Gartenkräuter \r\ngrün.  Die  immergrünen  Bäume  stehen  auch  hier  hin  und \r\nwieder,  so  daß  man  das  abgefallene  Laub  der  übrigen \r\nkaum  vermißt.  In  den  Gärten  stehen  Pomeranzenbäume \r\nvoller  Früchte,  aus  der  Erde  wachsend  und  unbedeckt. \r\nVon  einer  sehr  angenehmen  Spazierfahrt,  die  wir  ans \r\nMeer  machten,  und  von  dem  Fischfang  daselbst  dachte \r\nich  umständlich  zu  erzählen,  als  abends  der  gute  Moritz, \r\nhereinreitend,  den  Arm  brach,  indem  sein  Pferd  auf  dem \r\nglatten  römischen  Pflaster  ausglitschte.  Das  zerstörte  die \r\nganze  Freude  und  brachte  in  unsern  kleinen  Zirkel  ein \r\nböses  Hauskreuz. \r\n\r\nDen  13.  Dezember. \r\nWie  herzlich  freut  es  mich,  daß  ihr  mein  Verschwinden \r\nso  ganz,  wie  ich  wünschte,  genommen  habt.  Versöhnt \r\nmir  nun  auch  jedes  Gemüt,  das  daran  dürfte  Anstoß  ge- \r\nnommen haben.  Ich  habe  niemand  kränken  wollen  und \r\nkann  nun  auch  nichts  sagen,  um  mich  zu  rechtfertigen, \r\nGott  behüte  mich,  daß  ich  jemals  mit  den  Prämissen  zu \r\ndiesem  Entschlüsse  einen  Freund  betrübe. \r\nIch  erhole  mich  nun  hier  nach  und  nach  von  meinem \r\nsalto  mortale  und  studiere  mehr,  als  daß  ich  genieße. \r\nRom  ist  eine  Welt,  und  man  braucht  Jahre,  um  sich  nur \r\nerst  drinne  gewahr  zu  werden.  Wie  glücklich  find  ich \r\ndie  Reisenden,  die  sehen  und  gehn. \r\nHeute  früh  fielen  mir  Winckelmanns  Briefe,  die  er  aus \r\nItalien  schrieb,  in  die  Hand.  Mit  welcher  Rührung  hab \r\nich  sie  zu  lesen  angefangen!     Vor  einunddreißig  Jahren, \r\n\r\n\r\n156  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nin  derselben  Jahrszeit,  kam  er,  ein  noch  ärmerer  Narr \r\nals  ich,  hierher;  ihm  war  es  auch  so  deutsch  Ernst  um \r\ndas  Gründliche  und  Sichre  der  Altertümer  und  der  Kunst. \r\nWie  brav  und  gut  arbeitete  er  sich  durch!  Und  was  ist \r\nmir  nun  aber  auch  das  Andenken  dieses  Mannes  auf \r\ndiesem  Platze! \r\n\r\nAußer  den  Gegenständen  der  Natur,  die  in  allen  ihren \r\nTeilen  wahr  und  konsequent  ist,  spricht  doch  nichts  so \r\nlaut  als  die  Spur  eines  guten,  verständigen  Mannes,  als \r\ndie  echte  Kunst,  die  ebenso  folgerecht  ist  als  jene.  Hier \r\nin  Rom  kann  man  das  recht  fühlen,  wo  so  manche  Will- \r\nkürlichkeit gewütet  hat,  wo  so  mancher  Unsinn  durch \r\nMacht  und  Geld  verewigt  worden. \r\n\r\nEine  Stelle  in  Winckelmanns  Brief  an  Francken  freute \r\nmich  besonders:  \"Man  muß  alle  Sachen  in  Rom  mit \r\neinem  gewissen  Phlegma  suchen,  sonst  wird  man  für \r\neinen  Franzosen  gehalten.  In  Rom,  glaub  ich,  ist  die \r\nhohe  Schule  für  alle  Welt,  und  auch  ich  bin  geläutert \r\nund  geprüft.\" \r\n\r\nDas  Gesagte  paßt  recht  auf  meine  Art,  den  Sachen  hier \r\nnachzugehn,  und  gewiß,  man  hat  außer  Rom  keinen  Be- \r\ngriff, wie  man  hier  geschult  wird.  Man  muß,  so  zu  sagen, \r\nwiedergeboren  werden,  und  man  sieht  auf  seine  vorigen \r\nBegriffe  wie  auf  Kinderschuhe  zurück.  Der  gemeinste \r\nMensch  wird  hier  zu  etwas,  wenigstens  gewinnt  er  einen \r\nungemeinen  Begriff,  wenn  es  auch  nicht  in  sein  Wesen \r\nübergehen  kann. \r\n\r\nDieser  Brief  kommt  euch  zum  neuen  Jahre.  Alles  Glück \r\nzum  Anfange!  vor  Ende  sehn  wir  uns  wieder,  und  das \r\nwird  keine  geringe  Freude  sein.  Das  vergangene  war \r\ndas  wichtigste  meines  Lebens:  ich  mag  nun  sterben  oder \r\nnoch  eine  Weile  dauern,  in  beiden  Fällen  war  es  gut. \r\nJetzt  noch  ein  Wort  an  die  Kleinen. \r\nDen  Kindern  mögt  ihr  folgendes  lesen  oder  erzählen. \r\nMan  merkt  den  Winter  nicht:  die  Gärten  sind  mit  immer- \r\ngrünen Bäumen  bepflanzt,  die  Sonne  scheint  hell  und \r\nwarm,  Schnee  sieht  man  nur  auf  den  entferntesten  Bergen \r\ngegen  Norden.  Die  Zitronenbäume,  die  in  den  Gärten \r\n9.n   den  Wänden  gepflanzt  sind,  werden  nun  nach  und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  15; \r\n\r\nnach  mit  Decken  von  Rohr  überdeckt,  die  Pomeranzen - \r\nbäume  aber  bleiben  frei  stehen.  Es  hängen  viele  Hun- \r\nderte der  schönsten  Früchte  an  so  einem  Baum,  der  nicht \r\nwie  bei  uns  beschnitten  und  in  einen  Kübel  gepflanzt  ist, \r\nsondern  in  der  Erde  frei  und  froh,  in  einer  Reihe  mit \r\nseinen  Brüdern  steht.  Man  kann  sich  nichts  Lustigers \r\ndenken  als  einen  solchen  Anblick.  Für  ein  geringes \r\nTrinkgeld  ißt  man  deren,  so  viel  man  will.  Sie  sind  schon \r\njetzt  recht  gut,  im  März  werden  sie  noch  besser  sein. \r\nNeulich  waren  wir  am  Meere  und  ließen  einen  Fischzug \r\ntun;  da  kamen  die  wunderlichsten  Gestalten  zum  Vor- \r\nschein, an  Fischen,  Krebsen  und  seltsamen  Unformen; \r\nauch  der  Fisch,  der  dem  Berührenden  einen  elektrischen \r\nSchlag  gibt. \r\n\r\nDen  20.  Dezanher. \r\nUnd  doch  ist  das  alles  mehr  Mühe  und  Sorge  als  Genuß. \r\nDie  Wiedergeburt,  die  mich  von  innen  heraus  umarbeitet, \r\nwirkt  immer  fort.  Ich  dachte  wohl  hier  was  Rechts  zu \r\nlernen;  daß  ich  aber  so  weit  in  die  Schule  zurückgehen, \r\ndaß  ich  so  viel  verlernen,  ja  durchaus  umlernen  müßte, \r\ndachte  ich  nicht.  Nun  bin  ich  aber  einmal  überzeugt  und \r\nhabe  mich  ganz  hingegeben,  und  je  mehr  ich  mich  selbst \r\nverleugnen  muß,  desto  mehr  freut  es  mich.  Ich  bin  wie \r\nein  Baumeister,  der  einen  Turm  aufführen  wollte  und  ein \r\nschlechtes  Fundament  gelegt  hatte;  er  wird  es  noch  bei- \r\nzeiten gewahr  und  bricht  gern  wieder  ab,  was  er  schon \r\naus  der  Erde  gebracht  hat,  seinen  Grundriß  sucht  er  zu \r\nerweitern,  zu  veredeln,  sich  seines  Grundes  mehr  zu  ver- \r\nsichern, und  freut  sich  schon  im  voraus  der  gewissem \r\nFestigkeit  des  künftigen  Baues.  Gebe  der  Himmel,  daß  \" \r\nbei  meiner  Rückkehr  auch  die  moralischen  Folgen  an \r\nmir  zu  fühlen  sein  möchten,  die  mir  das  Leben  in  einer \r\nweitern  Welt  gebracht  hat.  Ja,  es  ist  zugleich  mit  dem \r\nKunstsinn  der  sittliche,  welcher  große  Erneuerung  leidet. \r\nDoktor  Munter  ist  hier,  von  seiner  Reise  nach  Sizilien \r\nzurückkehrend,  ein  energischer  heftiger  Mann;  seine \r\nZwecke  kenne  ich  nicht.  Er  wird  im  Mai  zu  euch  kom- \r\nmen und  mancherlei  zu  erzählen  wissen.     Er  reiste  zwei \r\n\r\n\r\n1 5  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nJahr  in  Italien.  Mit  den  Italienern  ist  er  unzufrieden, \r\nwelche  die  bedeutenden  Empfehlungsschreiben,  die  er \r\nmitgebracht  und  die  ihm  manches  Archiv,  manche  ge- \r\nheime Bibliothek  eröffnen  sollten,  nicht  genugsam  respek- \r\ntiert, so  daß  er  nicht  völlig  zu  seinen  Wünschen  ge- \r\nlangt. \r\n\r\nSchöne  Münzen  hat  er  gesammelt  und  besitzt,  wie  er  mir \r\nsagte,  ein  Manuskript,  welches  die  Münzwissenschaft  auf \r\nscharfe  Kennzeichen,  wie  die  Linneischen  sind,  zurück- \r\nführt. Herder  erkundigt  sich  wohl  mehr  darum;  vielleicht \r\nwird  eine  Abschrift  erlaubt.  So  etwas  zu  machen,  ist \r\nmöglich;  gut,  wenn  es  gemacht  ist;  und  wir  müssen \r\ndoch  auch,  früh  oder  spat,  in  dieses  Fach  ernstlicher \r\nhinein. \r\n\r\nDen  25.  Dczciiiher. \r\nIch  fange  nun  schon  an,  die  besten  Sachen  zum  zweiten- \r\nmal zu  sehen,  wo  denn  das  erste  Staunen  sich  in  ein  Mit- \r\nleben und  reineres  Gefühl  des  Wertes  der  Sache  auflöst. \r\nUm  den  höchsten  Begi-ifif  dessen,  was  die  Menschen  ge- \r\nleistet haben,  in  sich  aufzunehmen,  muß  die  Seele  erst \r\nzur  vollkommenen  Freiheit  gelangen. \r\nDer  Marmor  ist  ein  seltsames  Material;  deswegen  ist \r\nApoll  von  Belvedere  im  Urbilde  so  grenzenlos  erfreulich: \r\ndenn  der  höchste  Hauch  des  lebendigen,  jünglingsfreien, \r\newig  jungen  Wesens  verschwindet  gleich  im  besten  Gips- \r\nabguß. \r\n\r\nGegen  uns  über  im  Palast  Rondanini  steht  eine  Medusen- \r\nmaske, wo,  in  einer  hohen  und  schönen  Gesichtsform, \r\nüber  Lebensgröße,  das  ängstliche  Starren  des  Todes  un- \r\n•säglich  trefflich  au.sgedrückt  ist.  Ich  besitze  schon  einen \r\nguten  Abguß,  aber  der  Zauber  des  Marmors  ist  nicht \r\nübrig  geblieben.  Das  Edle,  Halbdurchsichtige  des  gilb- \r\nlichen,  der  Fleischfai-be  sich  nähernden  Steins  ist  ver- \r\nschwunden. Der  Gips  sieht  immer  dagegen  kreidenhaft \r\nund  tot. \r\n\r\nUnd  doch,  was  für  eine  Freude  bringt  es,  zu  einem  Gips- \r\ngießer hineinzutreten,  wo  man  die  herrlichen  Glieder  der \r\nStatuen    einzeln   aus  der  Form   hervorgehen   sieht   und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1786  159 \r\n\r\ndadixrch  ganz  neue  Ansichten  der  Gestalten  gewinntl \r\nAlsdann  erblickt  man  nebeneinander,  was  sich  in  Rom \r\nzerstreut  befindet;  welches  zur  Vergleichung  unschätzbar \r\ndienlich  ist.  Ich  habe  mich  nicht  enthalten  können^  den \r\nkolossalen  Kopf  eines  Jupiters  anzuschaften.  Er  steht \r\nmeinem  Bette  gegenüber,  wohl  beleuchtet,  damit  ich  so- \r\ngleich meine  Morgenandacht  an  ihn  richten  kann,  und \r\nder  uns,  bei  aller  seiner  Großheit  und  Würde,  das  lustigste \r\nGeschichtchen  veranlaßt  hat. \r\n\r\nUnserer  alten  Wirtin  schleicht  gewöhnlich,  wenn  sie  das \r\nBett  zu  machen  hereinkommt,  ihre  vertraute  Katze  nach. \r\nIch  saß  im  großen  Saale  und  hörte  die  Frau  drinne  ihr \r\nGeschäft  treiben.  Auf  einmal,  sehr  eilig  und  heftig,  gegen \r\nihre  Gewohnheit,  öffnet  sie  die  Türe  und  ruft  mich,  eilig \r\nzu  kommen  und  ein  Wunder  zu  sehen.  Auf  meine  Frage, \r\nwas  es  sei,  erwiderte  sie,  die  Katze  bete  Gott  Vater  an. \r\nSie  habe  diesem  Tiere  wohl  längst  angemerkt,  daß  es \r\nVerstand  habe  wie  ein  Christ;  dieses  aber  sei  doch  ein \r\ngroßes  Wunder.  Ich  eilte,  mit  eigenen  Augen  zu  sehen, \r\nund  es  war  wirklich  wunderbar  genug.  Die  Büste  steht \r\nauf  einem  hohen  Fuße,  und  der  Körper  ist  weit  unter \r\nder  Brust  abgeschnitten,  so  daß  also  der  Kopf  in  die \r\nHöhe  ragt.  Nun  war  die  Katze  auf  den  Tisch  gesprun- \r\ngen, hatte  ihre  Pfoten  dem  Gott  auf  die  Brust  gelegt  und \r\nreichte  mit  ihrer  Schnauze,  indem  sie  die  Glieder  mög- \r\nlichst ausdehnte,  gerade  bis  an  den  heiligen  Bart,  den \r\nsie  mit  der  größten  Zierlichkeit  beleckte  und  sich  weder \r\ndurch  die  Interjektion  der  Wirtin  noch  durch  meine  Da- \r\nzwischenkunft  im  mindesten  stören  ließ.  Der  guten  Frau \r\nließ  ich  ihre  Verwunderung,  erklärte  mir  aber  diese  selt- \r\nsame Katzenandacht  dadurch,  daß  dieses  scharf  riechende \r\nTier  wohl  das  Fett  möchte  gespürt  haben,  das  sich  aus \r\nder  Form  in  die  Vertiefungen  des  Bartes  gesenkt  und \r\ndort  verhalten  hatte. \r\n\r\nDen  2g.  Dezember. \r\nVon  Tischbein  muß  ich  noch  vieles  erzählen  und  rühmen, \r\nwie  ganz  original  deutsch  er  sich  aus  sich  selbst  heraus- \r\nbildete, sodann  aber  dankbar  melden,  daß  er  die  Zeit \r\n\r\n\r\ni6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nseines  zweiten  Aufenthalts  in  Rom  über  für  mich  gar  freund- \r\nschaftlich gesorgt  hat,  indem  er  mir  eine  Reihe  Kopien \r\nnach  den  besten  Meistern  fertigen  ließ,  einige  in  schwai-- \r\nzer  Kreide,  andere  in  Sepia  und  Aquarell,  die  erst  in \r\nDeutschland,  wo  man  von  den  Originalen  entfernt  ist, \r\nan  Wert  gewinnen  und  mich  an  das  Beste  erinnern \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nAuf  seiner  Künstlerlaufbahn,  da  er  sich  erst  zum  Porträt \r\nbestimmte,  kam  Tischbein  mit  bedeutenden  Männern,  be- \r\nsonders auch  zu  Zürich,  in  Berührung  und  hat  an  ihnen \r\nsein  Gefühl  gestärkt  und  seine  Einsicht  erweitert. \r\nDen  zweiten  Teil  der  Zerstreuten  Blätter  brachte  ich  mit \r\nhieher  und  war  doppelt  willkommen.  Wie  gut  dies  Büch- \r\nlein auch  bei  wiederholtem  Lesen  wirkt,  sollte  wohl \r\nHerder  zu  seiner  Belohnung  recht  umständlich  erfahren. \r\nTischbein  wollte  gar  nicht  begreifen,  wie  man  so  etwas \r\nhabe  schreiben  können,  ohne  in  Italien  gewesen  zusein. \r\n\r\nIn  diesem  Künstlerwesen  lebt  man  wie  in  einem  Spiegel- \r\nzimmer, wo  man  auch  wider  Willen  sich  selbst  und  an- \r\ndere oft  wiederholt  sieht.  Ich  bemerkte  wohl,  daß  Tisch- \r\nbein mich  öfters  aufmerksam  betrachtete;  und  nun  zeigt \r\nsich's,  daß  er  mein  Porträt  zu  malen  gedenkt.  Sein  Ent- \r\nwurf ist  fertig,  er  hat  die  Leinwand  schon  aufgespannt. \r\nIch  soll  in  Lebensgröße  als  Reisender,  in  einen  weißen \r\nMantel  gehüllt,  in  freier  Luft,  auf  einem  umgestürzten \r\nObelisken  sitzend,  vorgestellt  werden,  die  tief  im  Hinter- \r\ngrunde liegenden  Ruinen  der  Campagna  di  Roma  über- \r\nschauend. Es  gibt  ein  schönes  Bild,  nur  zu  groß  für \r\nunsere  nordischen  Wohnungen.  Ich  werde  wohl  wieder \r\ndort  unterkriechen,  das  Porträt  aber  wird  keinen  Platz \r\nfinden. \r\n\r\nWie  viel  Versuche  man  übrigens  macht,  mich  aus  meiner \r\nDunkelheit  herauszuziehen,  wie  die  Poeten  mir  schon \r\nihre  Sachen  vorlesen  oder  vorlesen  lassen,  wie  es  nur \r\nvon  mir  abhinge,  eine  Rolle  zu  spielen,  irrt  mich  nicht \r\nund  ist  mir  unterhaltend  genug,  da  ich  schon  abgepaßt \r\nhabe,  wo  es  in  Rom  hinaus  will.  Denn  die  vielen  kleinen \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  161 \r\n\r\nZirkel  zu  den  Füßen  der  Herrscherin  der  Welt  deuten \r\nhie  und  da  auf  etwas  Kleinstädtisches. \r\nJa,  es  ist  hier  wie  allenthalben,  und  was  mit  mir  und \r\ndurch  mich  geschehen  könnte,  macht  mir  schon  Lange- \r\nweile, ehe  es  geschieht.  Man  muß  sich  zu  einer  Partei \r\nschlagen,  ihre  Leidenschaften  und  Kabalen  verfechten \r\nhelfen,  Künstler  und  Dilettanten  loben,  Mitwerber  ver- \r\nkleinern, sich  von  Großen  und  Reichen  alles  gefallen \r\nlassen.  Diese  sämtliche  Litanei,  um  derentwillen  man \r\naus  der  Welt  laufen  möchte,  sollte  ich  hier  mitbeten,  und \r\nganz  ohne  Zweck? \r\n\r\nNein,  ich  gehe  nicht  tiefer,  als  nur  um  das  auch  zu  ken- \r\nnen und  dann  auch  von  dieser  Seite  zu  Hause  zufrieden \r\nzu  sein  und  mir  und  andern  alle  Lust  in  die  liebe  weite \r\nWelt  zu  benehmen.  Ich  will  Rom  sehen,  das  bestehende, \r\nnicht  das  mit  jedem  Jahrzehnt  vorübergehende.  Hätte \r\nich  Zeit,  ich  wollte  sie  besser  anwenden.  Besonders  liest \r\nsich  Geschichte  von  hier  aus  ganz  anders  als  an  jedem \r\nOrte  der  Welt.  Anderwärts  liest  man  von  außen  hinein, \r\nhier  glaubt  man  von  innen  hinaus  zu  lesen:  es  lagert  sich \r\nalles  um  uns  her  und  geht  wieder  aus  von  uns.  Und  das \r\ngilt  nicht  allein  von  der  römischen  Geschichte,  sondern \r\nvon  der  ganzen  Weltgeschichte.  Kann  ich  doch  von  hier \r\naus  die  Eroberer  bis  an  die  Weser  und  bis  an  den  Euphrat \r\nbegleiten  oder,  wenn  ich  ein  Maulafie  sein  will,  die  zu- \r\nrückkehrenden Triumphatoren  in  der  heiligen  Straße  er- \r\nwarten ;  indessen  habe  ich  mich  von  Korn-  und  Geld- \r\nspenden genährt  und  nehme  behaglich  teil  an  aller  dieser \r\nHerrlichkeit. \r\n\r\nDeti  2  Januar  lySy. \r\nMan  mag  zugunsten  einer  schriftlichen  und  mündlichen \r\nÜberlieferung  sagen,  was  man  will,  in  den  wenigsten \r\nFällen  ist  sie  hinreichend;  denn  den  eigentlichen  Cha- \r\nrakter irgend  eines  Wesens  kann  sie  doch  nicht  mitteilen, \r\nselbst  nicht  in  geistigen  Dingen.  Hat  man  aber  erst  einen \r\nsichern  Blick  getan,  dann  mag  man  gerne  lesen  und  hören: \r\ndenn  das  schließt  sich  an  an  den  lebendigen  Eindruck; \r\nnun  kann  man  denken  und  beurteilen. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  II \r\n\r\n\r\n1 6  2  ITA  I  JENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nIhr  habt  mich  oft  ausgespottet  und  zurückziehen  wollen, \r\nwenn  ich  Steine,  Kräuter  und  Tiere  mit  besonderer  Nei- \r\ngung aus  gewissen  entschiedenen  Gesichtspunkten  be- \r\ntrachtete; nun  richte  ich  meine  Aufmerksamkeit  auf  den \r\nBaumeister,  Bildhauer  und  Maler  und  werde  mich  auch \r\nhier  finden  lernen. \r\n\r\nDen  6.  Januar. \r\nEben  komme  ich  von  Moritz,  dessen  geheilter  Arm  heute \r\naufgebunden  worden.  Es  steht  und  geht  recht  gut.  Was \r\nich  diese  vierzig  Tage  bei  diesem  Leidenden  als  Wiirter, \r\nBeichtvater  und  Vertrauter,  als  Finanzminister  und  ge- \r\nheimer Sekretär  erfahren  und  gelernt,  mag  uns  in  der \r\nFolge  zugute  kommen.  Die  fatalsten  Leiden  und  die \r\nedelsten  Genüsse  gingen  diese  Zeit  her  immer  einander \r\nzur  Seite. \r\n\r\nZu  meiner  Erquickung  habe  ich  gestern  einen  Ausguß \r\ndes  kolossalen  Junokopfes,  wovon  das  Original  in  der \r\nVilla  Ludovisi  steht,  in  den  Saal  gestellt.  Es  war  dieses \r\nmeine  erste  Liebschaft  in  Rom,  iind  nun  besitz  ich  sie. \r\nKeine  Worte  geben  eine  Ahnung  davon.  Es  ist  wie  ein \r\nGesang  Homers. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  aber  auch  für  die  Zukunft  die  Nähe  einer  so \r\nguten  Gesellschaft  wohl  verdient;  denn  ich  kann  nun  ver- \r\nmelden, daß  Iphigenia  endlich  fertig  geworden  ist,  d.  h \r\ndaß  sie  in  zwei  ziemlich  gleichlautenden  Exemplaren  vor \r\nmir  auf  dem  Tische  liegt,  wovon  das  eine  nächstens  zu \r\neuch  wandern  soll.  Nehmt  es  freundlich  auf;  denn  frei- \r\nlich steht  nicht  auf  dem  Papiere,  was  ich  gesollt,  wohl \r\naber  kann  man  erraten,  was  ich  gewollt  habe. \r\nIhr  beklagtet  euch  schon  einigemal  über  dunkle  Stellen \r\nmeiner  Briefe,  die  auf  einen  Druck  hindeuten,  den  ich \r\nunter  den  herrlichsten  Erscheinungen  erleide.  Hieran \r\nhatte  diese  griechische  Reisegefährtin  nicht  geringen  An- \r\nteil, die  mich  zur  Tätigkeit  nötigte,  wenn  ich  hätte \r\nschauen  sollen. \r\n\r\nIch  erinnerte  mich  jenes  treft'lichen  Freundes,  der  sich \r\nauf  eine  große  Reise  eingerichtet  hatte,  die  man  wohl \r\neine  Entdeckungsreise  hätte  nennen  können.  Nachdem  er \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  163 \r\n\r\neinige  Jahre  darauf  studiert  und  ökonomisiert,  fiel  es  ihm \r\nzuletzt  noch  ein,  die  Tochter  eines  angesehenen  Hauses \r\nzu  entführen,  weil  er  dachte,  es  ging  in  einem  hin. \r\nEbenso  frevelhaft  entschloß  ich  mich,  Iphigenien  nach \r\nKarlsbad  mitzunehmen.  An  welchem  Orte  ich  mich \r\nbesonders  mit  ihr  unterhalten,  will  ich  kürzlich  auf- \r\nzeichnen. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  den  Brenner  verließ,  nahm  ich  sie  aus  dem  größ- \r\nten Paket  und  steckte  sie  zu  mir.  Am  Gardasee,  als  der \r\ngewaltige  Mittagswind  die  Wellen  ans  Ufer  trieb,  wo  ich \r\nwenigstens  so  allein  war  als  meine  Heldin  am  Gestade \r\nvon  Tauris,  zog  ich  die  ersten  Linien  der  neuen  Bearbei- \r\ntung, die  ich  in  Verona,  Vicenza,  Padua,  am  fleißigsten \r\naber  in  Venedig  fortsetzte.  Sodann  aber  geriet  die  Arbeit \r\nin  Stocken,  ja  ich  ward  auf  eine  neue  Erfindung  geführt, \r\nnämlich  Iphigenia  auf  Delphi  zu  schreiben,  welches  ich \r\nauch  sogleich  getan  hätte,  wenn  nicht  die  Zerstreuung \r\nund  ein  Pflichtsgefühl  gegen  das  ältere  Stück  mich  abge- \r\nhalten hätte. \r\n\r\nIn  Rom  aber  ging  die  Arbeit  in  geziemender  Stetigkeit \r\nfort.  Abends  beim  Schlafengehen  bereitete  ich  mich  aufs \r\nmorgende  Pensum,  welches  denn  sogleich  beim  Erwachen \r\nangegriften  wurde.  Mein  Verfahren  dabei  war  ganz  ein- \r\nfach: ich  schrieb  das  Stück  ruhig  ab  und  ließ  es  Zeile  vor \r\nZeile,  Period  vor  Period  regelmäßig  erklingen.  Was  dar- \r\naus entstanden  ist,  werdet  ihr  beurteilen.  Ich  habe  dabei \r\nmehr  gelernt  als  getan.  Mit  dem  Stücke  selbst  erfolgen \r\nnoch  einige  Bemerkungen. \r\n\r\nDaß  ich  auch  einmal  wieder  von  kirchlichen  Dingen  rede, \r\nso  will  ich  erzählen,  daß  wir  die  Christnacht  herum- \r\nschwärmten und  die  Kirchen  besuchten,  wo  Funktionen \r\ngehalten  werden.  Eine  besonders  ist  sehr  besucht,  deren \r\nOrgel  und  Musik  überhaupt  so  eingerichtet  ist,  daß  zu \r\neiner  Pastoralmusik  nichts  an  Klängen  abgeht,  weder  die \r\nSchalmeien  der  Hirten,  noch  das  Zwitschern  der  Vögel, \r\nnoch  das  Blöken  der  Schafe. \r\n\r\nAm  ersten  Christfeste  sah  ich  den  Papst  und  die  ganze \r\nKlerisei  in  der  Peterskirche,  da  er  zum  Teil  vor  dem \r\n\r\n\r\ni64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nThron,  zum  Teil  vom  Thron  herab  das  Hochamt  hielt. \r\nEs  ist  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  in  seiner  Art,  prächtig  und \r\nwürdig  genug;  ich  bin  aber  im  protestantischen  Dioge- \r\nnismus  so  alt  geworden,  daß  mir  diese  Herrlichkeit  mehr \r\nnimmt  als  gibt;  ich  möchte  auch,  wie  mein  frommer \r\nVorfahre,  zu  diesen  geistlichen  Weltüberwindern  sagen: \r\nVerdeckt  mir  doch  nicht  die  Sonne  höherer  Kunst  und \r\nreiner  Menschheit. \r\n\r\nHeute,  als  am  Dreikönigsfeste,  habe  ich  die  Messe  nach \r\ngriechischem  Ritus  vortragen  sehen  und  hören.  Die \r\nZeremonien  scheinen  mir  stattlicher,  strenger,  nachdenk- \r\nlicher und  doch  populärer  als  die  lateinischen. \r\nAuch  da  hab  ich  wieder  gefühlt,  daß  ich  für  alles  zu  alt \r\nbin,  nur  fürs  Wahre  nicht.  Ihre  Zeremonien  und  Opern, \r\nihre  Umgänge  und  Ballette,  es  fließt  alles  wie  Wasser \r\nvon  einem  Wachstuchmantel  an  mir  herunter.  Eine  Wir- \r\nkung der  Natur  hingegen,  wie  der  Sonnenuntergang  von \r\nVilla  Madama  gesehen,  ein  Werk  der  Kunst,  wie  die \r\nviel  verehrte  Juno,  machen  tiefen  und  bleibenden  Ein- \r\ndruck. \r\n\r\nNun  graut  mir  schon  vor  dem  Theaterwesen.  Die  nächste \r\nWoche  werden  sieben  Bühnen  eröffnet.  Anfossi  ist  selbst \r\nhier  und  gibt  Alexander  in  Indien;  auch  wird  ein  Cyrus \r\ngegeben  und  die  Eroberung  von  Troja  als  Ballett.  Das \r\nwäre  was  für  die  Kinder. \r\n\r\nDen  lo.  Januar. \r\nHier  folgt  denn  also  das  Schmerzenskind;  denn  dieses \r\nBeiwort  verdient  Iphigenia,  aus  mehr  als  einem  Sinne. \r\nBei  Gelegenheit,  daß  ich  sie  unsern  Künstlern  vorlas, \r\nstrich  ich  verschiedene  Zeilen  an,  von  denen  ich  einige \r\nnach  meiner  Überzeugung  verbesserte,  die  andern  aber \r\nstehen  lasse,  ob  vielleicht  Herder  ein  paar  Federzüge \r\nhineintun  will.  Ich  habe  mich  daran  ganz  stumpf  ge- \r\n■  arbeitet. \r\n\r\nDenn  warum  ich  die  Prosa  seit  mehreren  Jahren  bei  mei- \r\nnen Arbeiten  vorzog,  daran  war  doch  eigentlich  schuld, \r\ndaß  unsere  Prosodie  in  der  größten  Unsicherheit  schwebt, \r\nwie  denn  meine  einsichtigen,  gelehrten,  mitarbeitenden \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787     ■  165 \r\n\r\nFreunde  die  Entscheidung  mancher  Fragen  dem  Gefühl, \r\ndem  Geschmack  anheimgaben,  wodurch  man  denn  doch \r\naller  Richtschnur  ermangelte. \r\n\r\nIphigenia  in  Jamben  zu  übersetzen  hätte  ich  nie  gewagt, \r\nwäre  mir  in  Moritzens  Prosodie  nicht  ein  Leitstern  er- \r\nschienen. Der  Umgang  mit  dem  Verfasser,  besonders \r\nwährend  seines  Krankenlagers,  hat  mich  noch  mehr  dar- \r\nüber aufgeklärt,  und  ich  ersuche  die  Freunde,  darüber \r\nmit  Wohlwollen  nachzudenken. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  auffallend,  daß  wir  in  unserer  Sprache  nur  wenige \r\nSilben  finden,  die  entschieden  kurz  oder  lang  sind.  Mit \r\nden  andern  verfährt  man  nach  Geschmack  oder  Willkür. \r\nNun  hat  Moritz  ausgeklügelt,  daß  es  eine  gewisse  Rang- \r\nordnung der  Silben  gebe  und  daß  die  dem  Sinne  nach \r\nbedeutendere  gegen  eine  weniger  bedeutende  lang  sei \r\nund  jene  kurz  mache,  dagegen  aber  auch  wieder  kurz \r\nwerden  könne,  wenn  sie  in  die  Nähe  von  einer  andern \r\ngerät,  welche  mehr  Geistesgewicht  hat.  Hier  ist  denn \r\ndoch  ein  Anhalten,  und  wenn  auch  damit  nicht  alles  ge- \r\ntan wäre,  so  hat  man  doch  indessen  einen  Leitfaden,  an \r\ndem  man  sich  hinschlingen  kann.  Ich  habe  diese  Maxime \r\nöfters  zu  Rate  gezogen  und  sie  mit  meiner  Empfindung \r\nübereinstimmend  getrol^en. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  oben  von  einer  Vorlesung  sprach,  so  muß  ich \r\ndoch  auch,  wie  es  damit  zugegangen,  kürzlich  erwähnen. \r\nDiese  jungen  Männer,  an  jene  früheren,  heftigen,  vor- \r\ndringenden Arbeiten  gewöhnt,  erwarteten  etwas  Berli- \r\nchingisches  und  konnten  sich  in  den  ruhigen  Gang  nicht \r\ngleich  finden;  doch  verfehlten  die  edlen  und  reinen  Stel- \r\nlen nicht  ihre  Wirkung.  Tischbein,  dem  auch  diese  fast \r\ngänzliche  Entäußerung  der  Leidenschaft  kaum  zu  Sinne \r\nwollte,  brachte  ein  artiges  Gleichnis  oder  Symbol  zum \r\nVorschein.  Er  verglich  es  einem  Opfer,  dessen  Rauch, \r\nvon  einem  sanften  Luftdruck  niedergehalten,  an  der  Erde \r\nhinzieht,  indessen  die  Flamme  freier  nach  der  Höhe  zu \r\ngewinnen  sucht.  Er  zeichnete  dies  sehr  hübsch  und  be- \r\ndeutend. Das  Blättchen  lege  ich  bei. \r\nUnd  so  hat  mich  denn  diese  Arbeit,  über  die  ich  bald \r\nhinauszukommen  dachte,  ein  völliges  Vierteljahr  unter- \r\n\r\n\r\n1 6 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nhalten  und  aufgehalten,  mich  beschäftigt  und  gequält. \r\nEs  ist  nicht  das  erstemal,  daß  ich  das  Wichtigste  neben- \r\nher tue,  und  wir  wollen  darüber  nicht  weiter  grillisieren \r\nund  rechten. \r\n\r\nEinen  hübschen  geschnittenen  Stein  lege  ich  bei,  ein \r\nLöwchen,  dem  eine  Bremse  vor  der  Nase  schnurrt.  Die \r\nAlten  liebten  diesen  Gegenstand  und  haben  ihn  oft  wie- \r\nderholt. Ich  wünsche,  daß  ihr  damit  künftig  eure  Briefe \r\nsiegelt,  damit  durch  diese  Kleinigkeit  eine  Art  von  Kunst- \r\necho von  euch  zu  mir  herüber  schalle. \r\n\r\n\r\nDen  13.  Januar. \r\nWie  viel  hätte  ich  jeden  Tag  zu  sagen,  und  wie  sehr  hält \r\nmich  Anstrengung  und  Zerstreuung  ab,  ein  kluges  Wort \r\naufs  Papier  zu  bringen.  Dazu  kommen  noch  die  frischen \r\nTage,  wo  es  überall  besser  ist  als  in  den  Zimmern,  die, \r\nohne  Ofen  und  Kamin,  uns  nur  zum  Schlafen  oder  I\\Iiß- \r\nbehagen  aufnehmen.  Einige  Vorfälle  der  letzten  Woche \r\ndarf  ich  jedoch  nicht  unberührt  lassen. \r\nIm  Palaste  Giustiniani  steht  eine  Minerva,  die  meine \r\nganze  Verehrung  hat.  Winckelmann  gedenkt  ihrer  kaum, \r\nwenigstens  nicht  an  der  rechten  Stelle,  und  ich  fühle \r\nmich  nicht  würdig  genug,  über  sie  etwas  zu  sagen.  Als \r\nwir  die  Statue  besahen  und  uns  lang  dabei  aufhielten, \r\nerzählte  uns  die  Frau  des  Kustode,  es  sei  dieses  ein  eh- \r\nmals  heiliges  Bild  gewesen,  und  die  Inglesi,  welche  von \r\ndieser  Religion  seien,  pflegten  es  noch  zu  verehren,  in- \r\ndem sie  ihm  die  eine  Hand  küßten,  die  auch  wirklich \r\nganz  weiß  war,  da  die  übrige  Statue  bräunlich  ist.  Auch \r\nsetzte  sie  hinzu,  eine  Dame  dieser  Religion  sei  vor  kur- \r\nzem da  gewesen,  habe  sich  auf  die  Knie  niedergeworfen \r\nund  die  Statue  angebetet.  Eine  so  wunderliche  Handlung \r\nhabe  sie,  eine  Christin,  nicht  ohne  Lachen  ansehen  kön- \r\nnen und  sei  zum  Saal  hinausgelaufen,  um  nicht  loszu- \r\nplatzen. Da  ich  auch  von  der  Statue  nicht  weg  wollte, \r\nfragte  sie  mich,  ob  ich  etwa  eine  Schöne  hätte,  die  diesem \r\nMarmor  ähnlich  sähe,  daß  er  mich  so  sehr  anzöge.  Das \r\ngute  Weib  kannte  nur  Anbetung  und  Liebe,  aber  von  der \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  167 \r\n\r\nreinen  Bewunderung  eines  herrlichen  Werkes,  von  der \r\nbrüderlichen  Verehrung  eines  Menschengeistes  konnte  sie \r\nkeinen  Begritif  haben.  Wir  freuten  uns  über  das  englische \r\nFrauenzimmer  und  gingen  weg  mit  der  Pjegier,  umzu- \r\nkehren, und  ich  werde  gewiß  bald  wieder  hingehen. \r\nWollen  meine  Freunde  ein  näheres  Wort  hören,  so  lesen \r\nsie,  was  Winckelmann  vom  hohen  Stil  der  Griechen  sagt. \r\nLeider  führt  er  dort  diese  Minerva  nicht  an.  Wenn  ich \r\naber  nicht  irre,  so  ist  sie  von  jenem  hohen  strengen  Stil, \r\nda  er  in  den  schönen  übergeht,  die  Knospe,  indem  sie \r\nsich  öfthet,  und  nun  eine  Minerva,  deren  Charakter  eben \r\ndieser  Übergang  so  wohl  ansteht! \r\n\r\nNun  von  einem  Schauspiel  anderer  Art!  kra.  Dreikönigs- \r\ntage, am  Feste  des  Heils,  das  den  Heiden  verkündigt \r\nworden,  waren  wir  in  der  Propaganda.  Dort  ward  in  Ge- \r\ngenwart dreier  Kardinäle  und  eines  großen  Auditorii  erst \r\neine  Rede  gehalten:  an  welchem  Orte  Maria  die  drei \r\nMagos  empfangen?  im  Stalle?  oder  wo  sonst?  dann  nach \r\nverlesnen  einigen  lateinischen  Gedichten  ähnliches  Ge- \r\ngenstandes traten  bei  dreißig  Seminaristen  nach  und  nach \r\nauf  und  lasen  kleine  Gedichte,  jeder  in  seiner  Landes- \r\nsprache: Malabarisch,  Epirotisch,  Türkisch,  Moldauisch, \r\nElenisch,  Persisch,  Kolchisch,  Hebräisch,  x^rabisch,  Sy- \r\nrisch, Kophtisch,  Sarazenisch,  Armenisch,  Hibernisch, \r\nMadagaskarisch,  Isländisch,  Boisch,  Ägyptisch,  Griechisch, \r\nIsaurisch,  Äthiopisch  usw.  und  mehrere,  die  ich  nicht \r\nverstehen  konnte.  Die  Gedichtchen  schienen  meist,  im \r\nNationalsilbenmaße  verfaßt,  mit  der  Nationaldeklamation \r\nvorgetragen  zu  werden;  denn  es  kamen  barbarische  Rhyth- \r\nmen und  Töne  hervor.  Das  Griechische  klang,  wie  ein \r\nStern  in  der  Nacht  erscheint.  Das  Auditorium  lachte  un- \r\nbändig über  die  fremden  Stimmen,  und  so  ward  auch \r\ndiese  Vorstellung  zur  Farce. \r\n\r\nNun  noch  ein  Geschichtchen,  wie  lose  man  im  heiligen \r\nRom  das  Heilige  behandelt.  Der  verstorbene  Kardinal \r\nAlbani  war  in  einer  solchen  Festversammlung,  wie  ich \r\nsie  eben  beschrieben.  Einer  der  Schüler  fing  in  einer \r\nfremden  Mundart  an,  gegen  die  Kardinäle  gewendet: \r\nGnaja!   gnaja!  so  daß   es  ungefähr  klang  wie:   Canaglia! \r\n\r\n\r\ni68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ncanaglia!  Der  Kardinal  wendete  sich  zu  seinen  Mitbrü- \r\ndem  und  sagte:  Der  kennt  uns  doch! \r\n\r\nWie  viel  tat  Winckelmann  nicht,  und  wie  viel  ließ  er  uns \r\nzu  wünschen  übrig.  Mit  den  Materialien,  die  er  sich  zu- \r\neignete, hatte  er  so  geschwind  gebaut,  um  unter  Dach  zu \r\nkommen.  Lebte  er  noch,  und  er  könnte  noch  frisch  und \r\ngesund  sein,  so  wäre  er  der  erste,  der  uns  eine  Umar- \r\nbeitung seines  Werks  gäbe.  Was  hätte  er  nicht  noch  be- \r\nobachtet, was  berichtigt,  was  benutzt,  das  von  andern \r\nnach  seinen  Grundsätzen  getan  und  beobachtet,  neuer- \r\ndings ausgegraben  und  entdeckt  worden.  Und  dann  wäre \r\nder  Kardinal  Albani  tot,  dem  zuliebe  er  manches  ge- \r\nschrieben und  vielleicht  manches  verschwiegen  hat. \r\n\r\nDen  i£.  Januar. \r\nUnd  so  ist  denn  endlich  auch  Aristodem,  und  zwar  sehr \r\nglücklich  und  mit  dem  größten  Beifall,  aufgeführt.  Da \r\nAbbate  Monti  zu  den  Hausverwandten  des  Nepoten  ge- \r\nhört und  in  den  oberen  Ständen  sehr  geschätzt  ist,  so \r\nwar  von  daher  alles  Gute  zu  hoften.  Auch  sparten  die \r\nLogen  ihren  Beifall  nicht.  Das  Parterre  war  gleich  von \r\nvornherein  durch  die  schöne  Diktion  des  Dichters  und  die \r\ntreffliche  Rezitation  der  Schauspieler  gewonnen,  und  man \r\nversäumte  keine  Gelegenheit,  seine  Zufriedenheit  an  den \r\nTag  zu  legen.  Die  deutsche  Künstlerbank  zeichnete  sich \r\ndabei  nicht  wenig  aus,  und  es  war  diesmal  ganz  am  Platze, \r\nda  sie  überhaupt  ein  wenig  vorlaut  ist. \r\nDer  Verfasser  war  zu  Hause  geblieben,  voller  Sorge  we- \r\ngen des  Gelingens  des  Stücks;  von  Akt  zu  Akt  kamen \r\ngünstige  Botschaften,  welche  nach  und  nach  seine  Be- \r\nsorglichkeit  in  die  größte  Freude  verwandelten.  Nun  fehlt \r\nes  nicht  an  Wiederholung  der  Vorstellung,  und  alles  ist \r\nin  dem  besten  Gleise.  So  kann  man  durch  die  entgegen- \r\ngesetztesten Dinge,  wenn  nur  jedes  sein  ausgesprochenes \r\nVerdienst  hat,  den  Beifall  der  Menge  sowohl  als  der \r\nKenner  erwerben. \r\n\r\nAber  die  Vorstellung  war  auch  sehr  löblich,  und  der \r\nHauptakteur,  der  das  ganze  Stück  ausfüllt,  sprach  und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  169 \r\n\r\nspielte  vortrefiflich:  man  glaubte  einen  der  alten  Kaiser \r\nauftreten  zu  sehen.  Sie  hatten  das  Kostüm,  das  uns  an \r\nden  Statuen  so  sehr  imponiert,  recht  gut  in  Theatertracht \r\nübersetzt,  und  man  sah  dem  Schauspieler  an,  daß  er  die \r\nAntiken  studiert  hatte. \r\n\r\nDen  16  /atiiiar. \r\nEin  großer  Kunstverlust  steht  Rom  bevor.  Der  König \r\nvon  Neapel  läßt  den  Herkules  Farnese  in  seine  Residenz \r\nbringen.  Die  Künstler  trauern  sämtlich;  indessen  werden \r\nwir  bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  etwas  sehen,  was  unsern  Vor- \r\nfahren verborgen  blieb. \r\n\r\nGedachte  Statue  nämlich,  vom  Kopf  bis  an  die  Knie  und \r\nsodann  die  unteren  Füße  mit  dem  Sockel,  worauf  sie \r\nstehen,  wurde  auf  Farnesischem  Grund  und  Boden  ge- \r\nfunden; die  Beine  aber,  vom  Knie  bis  an  die  Knöchel, \r\nfehlten  und  wurden  durch  Wilhelm  Porta  ersetzt.  Auf \r\ndiesen  steht  er  nun  bis  auf  den  heutigen  Tag.  Indessen \r\nwaren  auf  Borghesischem  Grund  und  Boden  die  echten \r\nalten  Beine  gefunden  worden,  die  man  denn  auch  in  der \r\nBorghesischen  Villa  aufgestellt  sah. \r\nGegenwärtig  gewinnt  es  Prinz  Borghese  über  sich  und \r\nverehrt  diese  köstlichen  Reste  dem  König  von  Neapel. \r\nDie  Beine  des  Porta  werden  abgenommen,  die  echten  an \r\ndie  Stelle  gesetzt,  und  man  verspricht  sich,  ob  man  gleich \r\nmit  jenen  bisher  ganz  wohl  zufrieden  gewesen,  nunmehr \r\neine  ganz  neue  Anschauung  und  mehr  harmonischen \r\nGenuß. \r\n\r\nDen  18.  Januar. \r\nGestern,  als  am  Feste  des  heiligen  Antonius  Abbas, \r\nmachten  wir  uns  einen  lustigen  Tag;  es  war  das  schönste \r\nWetter  von  der  Welt,  hatte  die  Nacht  Eis  gefroren,  und \r\nder  Tag  war  heiter  und  warm. \r\n\r\nEs  läßt  sich  bemerken,  daß  alle  Religionen,  die  entweder \r\nihren  Kultus  oder  ihre  Spekulationen  ausdehnten,  zuletzt \r\ndahin  gelangen  mußten,  daß  sie  auch  die  Tiere  einiger- \r\nmaßen geistlicher  Begünstigungen  teilhaft  werden  ließen \r\nSankt  Anton  der  Abt  oder  Bischof  ist  Patron  der  vier- \r\n\r\n\r\n1 7  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nfüßigen  Geschöpfe,  sein  Fest  ein  saturnalischer  Feiertag \r\nfür  die  sonst  belasteten  Tiere,  so  wie  für  ihre  Wärter \r\nund  Lenker.  Alle  Herrschaften  müssen  heute  zu  Hause \r\nbleiben  oder  zu  Fuß  gehen;  man  verfehlt  niemals,  be- \r\ndenkliche Geschichten  zu  erzählen,  wie  ungläubige  Vor- \r\nnehme, welche  ihre  Kutscher  an  diesem  Tage  zu  fahren \r\ngenötigt,  durch  große  Unfälle  gestraft  worden. \r\nDie  Kirche  liegt  an  einem  so  weitschichtigen  Platz,  daß \r\ner  beinahe  für  öde  gelten  könnte;  heute  ist  er  aber  auf \r\ndas  lustigste  belebt.  Pferde  und  Maultiere,  deren  Mähnen \r\nund  Schweife  mit  Bändern  schön,  ja  prächtig  eingefloch- \r\nten zu  schauen,  werden  vor  die  kleine,  von  der  Kirche \r\netwas  abstehende  Kapelle  geführt,  wo  ein  Priester,  mit \r\neinem  großen  Wedel  versehen,  das  Weihwasser,  das  in \r\nButten  und  Kübeln  vor  ihm  steht,  nicht  schonend,  auf \r\ndie  muntern  Geschöpfe  derb  losspritzt,  manchmal  sogar \r\nschalkhaft,  um  sie  zu  reizen.  Andächtige  Kutscher  brin- \r\ngen größere  oder  kleinere  Kerzen,  die  Herrschaften  sen- \r\nden Almosen  und  Geschenke,  damit  die  kostbaren,  nütz- \r\nlichen Tiere,  ein  Jahr  über,  vor  allem  Unfall  sicher  bleiben \r\nmögen.  Esel  und  Hornvieh,  ihren  Besitzern  ebenso  nütz- \r\nlich und  wert,  nehmen  gleichfalls  an  diesem  Segen  ihr \r\nbeschieden  Teil. \r\n\r\nNachher  ergötzten  wir  uns  an  einer  großen  Wanderung \r\nunter  einem  so  glücklichen  Himmel,  umgeben  von  den \r\ninteressantesten  Gegenständen,  denen  wir  doch  diesmal \r\nwenig  Aufmerksamkeit  schenkten,  vielmehr  Lust  und \r\nScherz  in  voller  Maße  walten  ließen. \r\n\r\nDen  ig.  Januar. \r\nSo  hat  denn  der  große  König,  dessen  Ruhm  die  Welt \r\nerfüllte,  dessen  Taten  ihn  sogar  des  katholischen  Para- \r\ndieses wert  machten,  endlich  auch  das  Zeitliche  gesegnet, \r\num  sich  mit  den  Heroen  seinesgleichen  im  Schattenreiche \r\nzu  unterhalten.  Wie  gern  ist  man  still,  wenn  man  einen \r\nsolchen  zur  Ruh  gebracht  hat. \r\n\r\nHeute  machten  wir  uns  einen  guten  Tag,  besahen  einen \r\nTeil  des  Kapitols,  den  ich  bisher  vernachlässigt,  dann \r\nsetzten  wir  über  die  Tiber  und  tranken  spanischen  Wein \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  171 \r\n\r\nauf  einem  neugelandeten  Schifte.  In  dieser  Gegend  will \r\nman  Romulus  und  Remus  gefunden  haben,  und  so  kann \r\nman,  wie  an  einem  doppelt  und  dreifachen  Pfingstfeste, \r\nzugleich  vom  heiligen  Kunstgeiste,  von  der  mildesten \r\nAtmosphäre,  von  antiquarischen  Erinnerungen  und  von \r\nsüßem  Weine  trunken  werden. \r\n\r\nDen  20.  Januar. \r\nWas  im  Anfang  einen  frohen  Genuß  gewährte,  wenn  man \r\nes  oberflächlich  hinnahm,  das  drängt  sich  hernach  be- \r\nschwerlich auf,  wenn  man  sieht,  daß  ohne  gründliche \r\nKenntnis  doch  auch  der  wahre  Genuß  ermangelt. \r\nAuf  Anatomie  bin  ich  so  ziemlich  vorbereitet,  und  ich \r\nhabe  mir  die  Kenntnis  des  menschlichen  Körpers,  bis \r\nauf  einen  gewissen  Grad,  nicht  ohne  Mühe  erworben. \r\nHier  wird  man  durch  die  ewige  Betrachtung  der  Statuen \r\nimmerfort,  aber  auf  eine  höhere  Weise,  hingewiesen. \r\nBei  unserer  medizinisch-chirurgischen  Anatomie  kommt \r\nes  bloß  darauf  an,  den  Teil  zu  kennen,  und  hierzu  dient \r\nauch  wohl  ein  kümmerlicher  Muskel.  In  Rom  aber  wol- \r\nlen die  Teile  nichts  heißen,  wenn  sie  nicht  zugleich  eine \r\nedle,  schöne  Form  darbieten. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  großen  Lazarett  San  Spirito  hat  man  den  Künst- \r\nlern zulieb  einen  sehr  schönen  Muskelkörper  dergestalt \r\nbereitet,  daß  die  Schönheit  desselben  in  Verwundrung \r\nsetzt.  Er  könnte  wirklich  für  einen  geschundenen  Halb- \r\ngott, für  einen  Marsyas  gelten. \r\n\r\nSo  pflegt  man  auch,  nach  Anleitung  der  Alten,  das  Skelett \r\nnicht  als  eine  künstlich  zusammengereihte  Knochenmasse \r\nzu  studieren,  vielmehr  zugleich  mit  den  Bändern,  wodurch \r\nes  schon  Leben  und  Bewegung  erhält. \r\nSage  ich  nun,  daß  wir  auch  abends  Perspektiv  studieren, \r\nso  zeigt  es  doch  wohl,  daß  wir  nicht  müßig  sind.  Bei \r\nallem  dem  aber  hofft  man  immer  mehr  zu  tun,  als  wirk- \r\nlich geschieht. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  Januar. \r\nVon  dem  deutschen  Kunstsinn  und  dem  dortigen  Kunst- \r\nleben kann  man  wohl  sagen:  Man  hört  läuten,  aber  nicht \r\n\r\n\r\n1 7  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nzusammenklingen.  Bedenke  ich  jetzt,  was  für  herrliche \r\nSachen  in  unserer  Nachbarschaft  sind,  und  wie  wenig  sie \r\nvon  mir  genutzt  worden,  so  möchte  ich  verzweifeln;  und \r\ndann  kann  ich  mich  wieder  auf  den  Rückweg  freuen, \r\nwenn  ich  hoffen  kann,  jene  Meisterwerke  zu  erkennen, \r\nan  denen  ich  nur  herumtappte. \r\n\r\nDoch  auch  in  Rom  ist  zu  wenig  für  den  gesorgt,  dem  es \r\nErnst  ist,  ins  Ganze  zu  studieren.  Er  muß  alles  aus  un- \r\nendlichen, obgleich  überreichen  Trümmern  zusammen - \r\nstoppeln.  Freilich  ist's  wenigen  Fremden  reiner  Ernst, \r\netwas  Rechts  zu  sehen,  und  zu  lernen.  Sie  folgen  ihren \r\nGrillen,  ihrem  Dünkel,  und  das  merken  sich  alle  diejeni- \r\ngen wohl,  die  mit  Fremden  zu  tun  haben.  Jeder  Führer \r\nhat  Absichten,  jeder  will  irgend  einen  Handelsmann  emp- \r\nfehlen, einen  Künstler  begünstigen;  mid  warum  sollte  er \r\nes  nicht.-  denn  schlägt  der  Unerfahrne  nicht  das  Vortreff- \r\nlichste aus,  das  man  ihm  anbietet.- \r\n\r\nEinen  außerordentlichen  Vorteil  hätte  es  der  Betrachtung \r\nbringen  können,  ja  es  wäre  ein  eignes  Museum  entstan- \r\nden, wenn  die  Regierung,  die  doch  erst  die  Erlaubnis \r\ngeben  muß,  wenn  ein  Altertum  ausgeführt  werden  soll, \r\nfest  darauf  bestanden  hätte,  daß  jedesmal  ein  Abguß  ge- \r\nliefert werden  müsse.  Hätte  aber  auch  ein  Papst  solch \r\neinen  Gedanken  gehabt,  alles  hätte  sich  widersetzt;  denn \r\nman  wäre  in  wenigen  Jahren  erschrocken  über  Wert  und \r\nWürde  solcher  ausgeführten  Dinge,  wozu  man  die  Er- \r\nlaubnis in  einzelnen  Fällen  heimlich  und  durch  allerlei \r\nMittel  zu  erlangen  weiß. \r\n\r\nSchon  früher,  aber  besonders  bei  der  Aufführung  des \r\nAristodem,  erwachte  der  Patriotismus  unserer  deutschen \r\nKünstler.  Sie  unterließen  nicht,  Gutes  von  meiner  Iphi- \r\ngenia  zu  reden,  einzelne  Stellen  wurden  wieder  verlangt, \r\nund  ich  fand  mich  zuletzt  zu  einer  Wiederholung  des \r\nGanzen  genötigt.  Auch  da  entdeckte  ich  manche  Stelle, \r\ndie  mir  gelenker  aus  dem  Munde  ging,  als  sie  auf  dem \r\nPapier  stand.  Freilich  ist  die  Poesie  nicht  fürs  Auge \r\ngemacht. \r\nDieser  gute  Ruf  erscholl  nun   bis   zu  ReifFenstein  und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  173 \r\n\r\nAngelica,  und  da  sollte  ich  denn  meine  Arbeit  abermals \r\nproduzieren.  Ich  erbat  mir  einige  Frist,  trug  aber  so- \r\ngleich die  Fabel  und  den  Gang  des  Stücks  mit  einiger \r\nUmständlichkeit  vor.  Mehr,  als  ich  glaubte,  gewann  sich \r\ndiese  Darstellung  die  Gunst  gedachter  Personen;  auch \r\nHerr  Zucchi,  von  dem  ich  es  am  wenigsten  erwartet, \r\nnahm  recht  freien  und  wohlempfundenen  Anteil.  Dieses \r\nklärt  sich  aber  dadurch  sehr  gut  auf,  daß  das  Stück  sich \r\nder  Form  nähert,  die  man  im  Griechischen,  Italienischen, \r\nFranzösischen  längst  gewohnt  ist  und  welche  demjenigen \r\nnoch  immer  am  besten  zusagt,  welcher  sich  an  die  eng- \r\nlischen Kühnheiten  noch  nicht  gewöhnt  hat. \r\n\r\nDen  2^.  Januar. \r\nNun  wird  es  mir  immer  schwerer,  von  meinem  Aufent- \r\nhalte in  Rom  Rechenschaft  zu  geben;  denn  wie  man  die \r\nSee  immer  tiefeij  findet,  je  weiter  man  hineingeht,  so \r\ngeht  es  auch  mir  in  Betrachtung  dieser  Stadt. \r\nMan  kann  das  Gegenwärtige  nicht  ohne  das  Vergangene \r\nerkennen,  und  die  Vergleichung  von  beiden  erfordert \r\nmehr  Zeit  und  Ruhe.  Schon  die  Lage  dieser  Hauptstadt \r\nder  Welt  führt  uns  auf  ihre  Erbauung  zurück.  Wir  sehen \r\nbald,  hier  hat  sich  kein  wanderndes,  großes,  wohlgeführtes \r\nVolk  niedergelassen  und  den  Mittelpunkt  eines  Reichs \r\nweislich  festgesetzt;  hier  hat  kein  mächtiger  Fürst  einen \r\nschicklichen  Ort  zum  Wohnsitz  einer  Kolonie  bestimmt. \r\nNein,  Hirten  und  Gesindel  haben  sich  hier  zuerst  eine \r\nStätte  bereitet;  ein  paar  rüstige  Jünglinge  haben  auf  dem \r\nHügel  den  Grund  zu  Palästen  der  Herrn  der  Welt  ge- \r\nlegt, an  dessen  Fuß  sie  die  Willkür  des  Ausrichters  zwi- \r\nschen Morast  und  Schilf  einst  hinlegte.  So  sind  die  sieben \r\nHügel  Roms  nicht  Erhöhungen  gegen  das  Land,  das  hin- \r\nter ihnen  liegt,  sie  sind  es  gegen  die  Tiber  und  gegen \r\ndas  uralte  Bette  der  Tiber,  was  Campus  Martius  ward. \r\nErlaubt  mir  das  Frühjahr  weitere  Exkursionen,  so  will \r\nich  die  unglückliche  Lage  ausführlicher  schildern.  Schon \r\njetzt  nehm  ich  den  herzlichsten  Anteil  an  dem  Jammer- \r\ngeschrei und  den  Schmerzen  der  Weiber  von  Alba,  die \r\nihre  Stadt  zerstören  sehn  und  den  schönen,  von  einem \r\n\r\n\r\n1 7  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nklugen  Anführer  gewählten  Platz  verlassen  müssen,  um \r\nan  den  Nebeln  der  Tiber  teilzunehmen,  den  elenden \r\nHügel  Coelius  zu  bewohnen  und  von  da  nach  ihrem  ver- \r\nlassenen Paradiese  zurückzusehn.  Ich  kenne  noch  wenig \r\nvon  der  Gegend,  aber  ich  bin  überzeugt:  kein  Ort  der \r\naltern  Völker  lag  so  schlecht  als  Rom,  und  da  die  Römer \r\nendlich  alles  verschlungen  hatten,  mußten  sie  wieder  mit \r\nihren  Landhäusern  hinaus  und  an  die  Plätze  der  zerstör- \r\nten Städte  rücken,  um  zu  leben  und  das  Leben  zu  ge- \r\nnießen. \r\n\r\nZu  einer  recht  friedlichen  Betrachtung  gibt  es  Anlaß, \r\nwie  viele  Menschen  hier  im  stillen  leben  und  wie  sich \r\njeder  nach  seiner  Weise  beschäftigt.  Wir  sahen  bei  einem \r\nGeistlichen,  der,  ohne  großes  angebornes  Talent,  sein \r\nLeben  der  Kunst  widmete,  sehr  interessante  Kopien  treff- \r\nlicher Gemälde,  die  er  in  Miniatur  nacl^ebildet  hat.  Sein \r\nvorzüglichstes  nach  dem  Abendmahl  des  Leonhard  da \r\nVinci  in  Mailand.  Der  Moment  ist  genommen,  da  Christus \r\nden  Jüngern,  mit  denen  er  vergnügt  und  freundschaftlich \r\nzu  Tische  sitzt,  erklärt  und  sagt:  Aber  doch  ist  einer \r\nunter  euch,  der  mich  verrät. \r\n\r\nMan  hofft  einen  Kupferstich,  entweder  nach  dieser  Kopie \r\noder  nach  andern,  mit  denen  man  sich  beschäftigt.  Es \r\nwird  das  größte  Geschenk  sein,  wenn  eine  treue  Nach- \r\nbildung im  großen  Publikum  erscheint. \r\nVor  einigen  Tagen  besuchte  ich  den  Pater  Jacquier,  einen \r\nFranziskaner,  auf  Trinitä  de'  Monti.  Er  ist  Franzos  von \r\nGeburt,  durch  mathematische  Schriften  bekannt,  hoch  in \r\nJahren,  sehr  angenehm  und  verständig.  Er  kannte  zu \r\nseiner  Zeit  die  besten  Männer  und  hat  sogar  einige  Mo- \r\nnate bei  Voltaire  zugebracht,  der  ihn  sehr  in  Affektion \r\nnahm. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  habe  ich  noch  mehr  gute  solide  Menschen  kennen \r\nlernen,  dergleichen  sich  hier  unzählige  befinden,  die  ein \r\npfäffisches  Mißtrauen  auseinander  hält.  Der  Buchhandel \r\ngibt  keine  Verbindung,  und  die  literarischen  Neuigkeiten \r\nsind  selten  fruchtbar. \r\nUnd  so  geziemt  es  dem  Einsamen,  die  Einsiedler  aufzu- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  175 \r\n\r\nsuchen.  Denn  seit  der  Aufführung  des  Aristodems,  zu \r\ndessen  Gunsten  wir  uns  wirkHch  tätig  erwiesen  hatten, \r\nführte  man  mich  abermals  in  Versuchung;  es  lag  aber \r\nnur  zu  klar  am  Tage,  daß  es  nicht  um  mich  zu  tun  sei: \r\nman  wollte  seine  Partei  verstärken,  mich  als  Instrument \r\nbrauchen,  und  wenn  ich  hätte  hervorgehen  und  mich  er- \r\nklären wollen,  hätte  ich  auch  als  Phantom  eine  kurze \r\nRolle  gespielt.  Nun  aber,  da  sie  sehen,  daß  mit  mir \r\nnichts  anzufangen  ist,  lassen  sie  mich  gehn,  und  ich \r\nwandle  meinen  sichern  Weg  fort. \r\n\r\nJa,  meine  Existenz  hat  einen  Ballast  bekommen,  der  ihr \r\ndie  gehörige  Schwere  gibt;  ich  fürchte  mich  nun  nicht \r\nmehr  vor  den  Gespenstern,  die  so  oft  mit  mir  spielten. \r\nSeid  auch  gutes  Muts,  ihr  werdet  mich  oben  halten  und \r\nmich  zu  euch  zurückziehen. \r\n\r\nDen  28.  Januar. \r\nZwei  Betrachtungen,  die  durch  alles  durchgehen,  welchen \r\nsich  hinzugeben  man  jeden  Augenblick  aufgefordert  wird, \r\nwill  ich,  da  sie  mir  klar  geworden,  zu  bezeichnen  nicht \r\nverfehlen. \r\n\r\nZuerst  also  wird  man,  bei  dem  Ungeheuern  und  doch  nur \r\ntrümmerhaften  Reichtum  dieser  Stadt,  bei  jedem  Kunst- \r\ngegenstande aufgefordert,  nach  der  Zeit  zu  fragen,  die \r\nihm  das  Dasein  gegeben.  Durch  Winckelmann  sind  wir \r\ndringend  aufgeregt,  die  Epochen  zu  sondern,  den  ver- \r\nschiedenen Stil  zu  erkennen,  dessen  sich  die  Völker  be- \r\ndienten, den  sie,  in  Folge  der  Zeiten,  nach  und  nach  aus- \r\ngebildet und  zuletzt  wieder  verbildet.  Hievon  überzeugte \r\nsich  jeder  wahre  Kunstfreund.  Anerkennen  tun  wir  alle \r\ndie  Richtigkeit  und  das  Gewicht  der  Forderung. \r\nAber  wie  nun  zu  dieser  Einsicht  gelangen!  Vorgearbeitet \r\nnicht  viel;  der  Begriff  richtig  und  herrlich  aufgestellt, \r\naber  das  Einzelne  im  ungewissen  Dunkel.  Eine  viel- \r\njährige entschiedene  Übung  des  Auges  ist  nötig,  und  man \r\nmuß  erst  lernen,  um  fragen  zu  können.  Da  hilft  kein \r\nZaudern  und  Zögern:  die  Aufmerksamkeit  auf  diesen \r\nwichtigen  Punkt  ist  nun  einmal  rege,  und  jeder,  dem  es \r\nErnst  ist,  sieht  wohl  ein,  daß  auch  in  diesem  Felde  kein \r\n\r\n\r\n1 7  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nUrteil  möglich  ist,  als  wenn  man  es  historisch  entwickeln \r\nkann. \r\n\r\nDie  zweite  Betrachtung  beschäftigt  sich  ausschließlich \r\nmit  der  Kunst  der  Griechen  und  sucht  zu  erforschen,  wie \r\njene  unvergleichlichen  Künstler  verfuhren,  um  aus  der \r\nmenschlichen  Gestalt  den  Kreis  götthcher  Bildung  zu \r\nentwickeln,  welcher  vollkommen  abgeschlossen  ist  und \r\nworin  kein  Hauptcharakter  so  wenig  als  die  Übergänge \r\nund  Vermittlungen  fehlen.  Ich  habe  eine  Vermutung,  daß \r\nsie  nach  eben  den  Gesetzen  verfuhren,  nach  welchen  die \r\nNatur  verfährt  und  denen  ich  auf  der  Spur  bin.  Nur  ist \r\nnoch  etwas  anders  dabei,  das  ich  nicht  auszusprechen \r\nwüßte. \r\n\r\nDe7i  2.  Februar. \r\nVon  der  Schönheit,  im  vollen  Mondschein  Rom  zu  durch- \r\ngehen, hat  man,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben,  keinen  Be- \r\ngrift'.  Alles  Einzelne  wird  von  den  großen  Massen  des \r\nLichts  und  Schattens  verschlungen,  und  nur  die  größten \r\nallgemeinsten  Bilder  stellen  sich  dem  Auge  dar.  Seit \r\ndrei  Tagen  haben  wir  die  hellsten  und  herrHchsten  Nächte \r\nwohl  und  vollständig  genossen.  Einen  vorzüglich  schönen \r\nAnblick  gewährt  das  Coliseo.  Es  wird  nachts  zuge- \r\nschlossen; ein  Eremit  wohnt  darin  an  einem  Kirchelchen, \r\nund  Bettler  nisten  in  den  verfallenen  Gewölben.  Sie \r\nhatten  auf  flachem  Boden  ein  Feuer  angelegt,  und  eine \r\nstille  Luft  trieb  den  Rauch  erst  auf  der  Arena  hin,  daß \r\nder  untere  Teil  der  Ruinen  bedeckt  war  und  die  Un- \r\ngeheuern Mauern  oben  drüber  finster  herausragten;  wir \r\nstanden  am  Gitter  und  sahen  dem  Phänomen  zu,  der \r\nMond  stand  hoch  und  heiter.  Nach  und  nach  zog  sich \r\nder  Rauch  durch  die  Wände,  Lücken  und  Öffnungen,  ihn \r\nbeleuchtete  der  Mond  wie  einen  Nebel.  Der  Anblick  war \r\nköstlich.  So  muß  man  das  Pantheon,  das  Kapitol  be- \r\nleuchtet sehn,  den  Vorhof  der  Peterskirche  und  andere \r\ngroße  Straßen  und  Plätze.  Und  so  haben  Sonne  und \r\nMond,  eben  wie  der  Menschengeist,  hier  ein  ganz  ande- \r\nres Geschäft  als  anderer  Orten,  hier,  wo  ihrem  Blick  un- \r\ngeheure und  doch  gebildete  Massen  entgegenstehn. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  177 \r\n\r\nDe7i  /j.  Februar. \r\nEines  Glücksfalls  muß  ich  erwähnen,  obgleich  eines  ge- \r\nringen. Doch  alles  Glück,  groß  oder  klein,  ist  von  ei7ier \r\nArt  und  immer  erfreulich.  Auf  Trinitä  de'  Monti  wird \r\nder  Grund  zum  neuen  Obelisk  gegraben:  dort  oben  ist \r\nalles  aufgeschüttetes  Erdreich  von  Ruinen  der  Gärten \r\ndes  Lucullus,  die  nachher  an  die  Kaiser  kamen.  Mein \r\nPerückenmacher  geht  frühe  dort  vorbei  und  findet  im \r\nSchutte  ein  flach  Stück  gebrannten  Ton  mit  einigen \r\nFiguren,  wäscht's  und  zeigt  es  uns.  Ich  eigne  es  mir \r\ngleich  zu.  Es  ist  nicht  gar  eine  Hand  groß  und  scheint \r\nvon  dem  Rande  einer  großen  Schüssel  zu  sein.  Es  stehn \r\nzwei  Greifen  an  einem  Opfertische,  sie  sind  von  der \r\nschönsten  Arbeit  und  freuen  mich  ungemein.  Stünden \r\nsie  auf  einem  geschnittenen  Stein,  wie  gern  würde  man \r\ndamit  siegeln. \r\n\r\nVon  vielen  andern  Sachen  sammelt's  sich  auch  um  mich, \r\nund  nichts  Vergebliches  oder  Leeres,  welches  hier  un- \r\nmöglich wäre,  alles  unterrichtend  und  bedeutend.  Am \r\nliebsten  ist  mir  denn  aber  doch,  was  ich  in  der  Seele \r\nmitnehme  und  was,  immer  wachsend^  sich  immer  ver- \r\nmehren kann. \r\n\r\nDen  75.  Februar. \r\nVor  meiner  Abreise  nach  Neapel  konnte  ich  einer  noch- \r\nmaligen Vorlesung  meiner  Iphigenia  nicht  entgehen. \r\nMadam  Angelica  und  Hofrat  Reifienstein  waren  die  Zu- \r\nhörer, und  selbst  Herr  Zucchi  hatte  darauf  gedrungen, \r\nweil  es  der  Wunsch  seiner  Gattin  war;  er  arbeitete  indes \r\nan  einer  großen  architektonischen  Zeichnung,  die  er  in \r\nDekorationsart  vortrefflich  zu  machen  versteht.  Er  war \r\nmit  Clerisseau  in  Dalmatien,  hatte  sich  überhaupt  mit \r\nihm  assoziiert,  zeichnete  die  Figuren  zu  den  Gebäuden \r\nund  Ruinen,  die  jener  herausgab,  und  lernte  dabei  so \r\nviel  Perspektive  und  Effekt,  daß  er  sich  in  seinen  alten \r\nTagen  auf  eine  würdige  Weise  auf  dem  Papier  damit \r\nvergnügen  kann. \r\n\r\nDie  zarte  Seele  Angelica  nahm  das  Stück  mit  unglaub- \r\nlicher Innigkeit  auf;    sie  versprach  mir  eine  Zeichnung \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  I? \r\n\r\n\r\n178    •  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\ndaraus  aufzustellen,  die  ich  zum  Andenken  besitzen  sollte. \r\nUnd  nun  gerade,  als  ich  mich  von  Rom  zu  scheiden  be- \r\nreite, werde  ich  auf  eine  zarte  Weise  mit  diesen  wohl- \r\nwollenden Personen  verbunden.  Es  ist  mir  zugleich  ein \r\nangenehmes  und  schmerzliches  Gefühl,  wenn  ich  mich \r\nüberzeuge,  daß  man  mich  ungern  wegläßt. \r\n\r\nDen  i6.  Februar. \r\nDie  glückliche  Ankunft  der  Iphigenia  ward  mir  auf  eine \r\nüberraschende  und  angenehme  Weise  verkündigt.  Auf \r\ndem  Wege  nach  der  Oper  brachte  man  mir  den  Brief \r\nvon  wohlbekannter  Hand,  und  diesmal  doppelt  willkom- \r\nmen, mit  dem  Löwchen  gesiegelt,  als  vorläufiges  Wahr- \r\nzeichen des  glücklich  angelangten  Pakets.  Ich  drängte \r\nmich  in  das  Opernhaus  und  suchte  mir  mitten  unter  dem \r\nfremden  Volk  einen  Platz  unter  dem  großen  Lüster  zu \r\nverschaffen.  Hier  fühlte  ich  mich  nun  so  nah  an  die \r\nMeinigen  gerückt,  daß  ich  hätte  aufhüpfen  und  sie  um- \r\narmen mögen.  Herzlich  dank,  ich,  daß  mir  die  nackte \r\nAnkunft  gemeldet  worden;  möget  ihr  euer  Nächstes  mit \r\neinem  guten  Worte  des  Beifalls  begleiten. \r\nHier  folgt  das  Verzeichnis,  wie  die  Exemplare,  die  ich \r\nvon  Göschen  zu  erwarten  habe,  unter  die  Freunde  ver- \r\nteilt werden  sollen;  denn  ob  es  mir  gleich  ganz  gleich- \r\ngültig ist,  wie  das  Publikum  diese  Sachen  betrachtet,  so \r\nwünscht  ich  doch  dadurch  meinen  Freunden  einige \r\nFreude  bereitet  zu  haben. \r\n\r\nMan  unternimmt  nur  zu  viel.  Denke  ich  an  meine  vier  letz- \r\nten Bände  im  ganzen,  so  möchte  mir  schwindelnd  werden; \r\nich  muß  sie  einzeln  angreifen,  und  so  wird  es  gehn. \r\nHätte  ich  nicht  besser  getan,  nach  meinem  ersten  Ent- \r\nschluß diese  Dinge  fragmentarisch  in  die  Welt  zu  schicken \r\nund  neue  Gegenstände,  an  denen  ich  frischeren  Anteil \r\nnehme,  mit  frischem  Mut  und  Kräften  zu  unternehmen? \r\nTat  ich  nicht  besser,  Iphigenia  auf  Delphi  zu  schreiben, \r\nals  mich  mit  den  Grillen  des  Tasso  herumzuschlagen? \r\nUnd  doch  habe  ich  auch  dahinein  schon  zu  viel  von \r\nmeinem  Eignen  gelegt,  als  daß  ich  es  fruchtlos  aufgeben \r\nsollte. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  179 \r\n\r\nIch  habe  mich  auf  den  Vorsaal  ans  Kamin  gesetzt,  und \r\ndie  Wärme  eines  diesmal  gut  genährten  Feuers  gibt  mir \r\nfrischen  Mut,  ein  neues  Blatt  anzufangen:  denn  es  ist \r\ndoch  gar  zu  schön,  daß  man  mit  seinen  neusten  Gedan- \r\nken so  weit  in  die  Ferne  reichen,  ja  seine  nächsten  Um- \r\ngebungen durch  Worte  dorthin  versetzen  kann.  Das \r\nWetter  ist  ganz  herrlich,  die  Tage  nehmen  merklich  zu, \r\nLorbeeren  und  Buchsbäume  blühen,  auch  die  Mandel- \r\nbäume. Heute  früh  überraschte  mich  ein  wundersamer \r\nAnblick:  ich  sah  von  ferne  hohe  stangenähnliche  Bäume, \r\nüber  und  über  von  dem  schönsten  Violett  bekleidet.  Bei \r\nnäherer  Untersuchung  war  es  der  Baum,  in  unsern  Treib- \r\nhäusern unter  dem  Namen  Judenbaum  bekannt,  dem  Bo- \r\ntaniker als  cercis  siliquastrum.  Seine  violetten  Schmet- \r\nterlingsblumen  bringt  er  unmittelbar  aus  dem  Stamme \r\nhervor.  Abgeholzt  den  letzten  Winter  waren  die  Stan- \r\ngen, die  ich  vor  mir  sah,  aus  deren  Rinde  die  wohl- \r\ngebildete und  gefärbte  Blume  zu  Tausenden  hervorbrach. \r\nDie  Maßlieben  dringen  wie  Ameisen  aus  dem  Boden, \r\nKrokus  und  Adonis  erscheinen  seltner,  aber  desto  zier- \r\nlicher und  zierender. \r\n\r\nWas  wird  mir  nicht  erst  das  mittägigere  Land  für  Freu- \r\nden und  Kenntnisse  geben,  aus  denen  für  mich  neue \r\nResultate  hervortreten.  Es  ist  mit  natürlichen  Dingen \r\nwie  mit  der  Kunst:  es  ist  so  viel  drüber  geschrieben,  und \r\njeder,  der  sie  sieht,  kann  sie  doch  wieder  in  neue  Kom- \r\nbination setzen. \r\n\r\nDenke  ich  an  Neapel,  ja  gar  nach  Sizilien,  so  fällt  es \r\neinem  sowohl  in  der  Erzählung  als  in  Bildern  auf,  daß \r\nin  diesen  Paradiesen  der  Welt  sich  zugleich  die  vulka- \r\nnische Hölle  so  gewaltsam  auftut  und  seit  Jahrtausenden \r\ndie  Wohnenden  und  Genießenden  aufschreckt  und  irre \r\nmacht. \r\n\r\nDoch  schlage  ich  mir  die  Hoffnung  jener  viel  bedeuten- \r\nden Ansichten  gern  aus  dem  Sinne,  um  vor  meiner  Ab- \r\nreise die  alte  Hauptstadt  der  Welt  noch  recht  zu  be- \r\nnutzen. \r\n\r\nSeit  vierzehn  Tagen  bin  ich  von  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht \r\nin  Bewegung;   was  ich  noch  nicht  gesehn,   such  ich  auf. \r\n\r\n\r\ni8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nDas  Vorzüglichste   wird   zum   zweiten-    und  drittenmal \r\n\r\nbetrachtet,  und  nun  ordnet  sich's  einigermaßen.  Denn \r\nindem  die  Hauptgegenstände  an  ihre  rechte  Stelle  kom- \r\nmen, so  ist  für  viele  mindere  dazwischen  Platz  und \r\nRaum.  Meine  Liebschaften  reinigen  und  entscheiden  sich, \r\nund  nun  erst  kann  mein  Gemüt  dem  Größeren  und  Ech- \r\ntesten mit  gelassener  Teilnahme  sich  entgegen  heben. \r\nDabei  findet  man  denn  wohl  den  Künstler  beneidens- \r\nwert, der  durch  Nachbildung  und  Nachahmung  auf  alle \r\nWeise  jenen  großen  Intentionen  sich  mehr  nähert,  sie \r\nbesser  begreift  als  der  bloß  Beschauende  und  Denkende. \r\nDoch  muß  am  Ende  jeder  tun,  was  er  vermag;  und  so \r\nspanne  ich  denn  alle  Segel  meines  Geistes  auf,  um  diese \r\nKüsten  zu  umschiffen. \r\n\r\nDas  Kamin  ist  diesmal  recht  durchgewärmt  und  die \r\nschönsten  Kohlen  aufgehäuft,  welches  bei  uns  selten  ge- \r\nschieht, weil  nicht  leicht  jemand  Lust  und  Zeit  hat,  dem \r\nKaminfeuer  ein  paar  Stunden  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  wid- \r\nmen, und  so  will  ich  denn  dieses  schöne  Klima  be- \r\nnutzen, um  einige  Bemerkungen  aus  meiner  Schreibtafel \r\nzu  retten,  die  schon  halb  verloschen  sind. \r\nAm  2.  Februar  begaben  wir  uns  in  die  Sixtinische  Ka- \r\npelle zur  Funktion,  bei  welcher  die  Kerzen  geweiht  wer- \r\nden. Ich  fand  mich  gleich  sehr  unbehaglich  und  zog  mit \r\nden  Freunden  bald  wieder  hinaus.  Denn  ich  dachte:  das \r\nsind  ja  grade  die  Kerzen,  welche  seit  dreihundert  Jahren \r\ndiese  herrlichen  Gemälde  verdüstern,  und  das  ist  ja  eben \r\nder  Weihrauch,  der  mit  heiliger  Unverschämtheit  die \r\neinzige  Kunstsonne  nicht  nur  umwölkt,  sondern  von  Jahr \r\nzu  Jahren  mehr  trübe  macht  und  zuletzt  gar  in  Finster- \r\nnis versenkt. \r\n\r\nDarauf  suchten  wir  das  Freie  und  kamen  nach  einem \r\ngroßen  Spaziergange  auf  San  Onofrio,  wo  Tasso  in  einem \r\nWinkel  begraben  liegt.  Auf  der  Klosterbibliothek  steht  seine \r\nBüste.  Das  Gesicht  ist  von  Wachs,  und  ich  glaube  gern, \r\ndaß  es  über  seinen  Leichnam  abgeformt  sei.  Nicht  ganz \r\nscharf,  und  hie  und  da  verdorben,  deutet  es  doch  im  ganzen \r\nmehr  als  irgend  ein  anderes  seiner  Bildnisse  auf  einen \r\ntalentvollen,  zarten,  feinen,  in  sich  geschloßnen  Mann. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  181 \r\n\r\nSo  viel  für  diesmal.  Jetzt  will  ich  an  des  ehrlichen  Volk- \r\nmanns zweiten  Teil,  der  Rom  enthält,  um  auszuziehen, \r\nwas  ich  noch  nicht  gesehn  habe.  Ehe  ich  nach  Neapel \r\nreise,  muß  die  Ernte  wenigstens  niedergemäht  sein;  sie \r\nin  Garben  zu  binden,  werden  auch  schon  gute  Tage \r\nkommen. \r\n\r\nDen  i'j.  Februar. \r\nDas  Wetter  ist  unglaublich  und  unsäglich  schön,  den \r\nganzen  Februar  bis  auf  vier  Regentage  ein  reiner  heller \r\nHimmel,  gegen  Mittag  fast  zu  warm.  Nun  sucht  man  das \r\nFreie,  und  wenn  man  bisher  sich  nur  mit  Göttern  und \r\nHelden  abgeben  mochte,  so  tritt  die  Landschaft  auf  ein- \r\nmal wieder  in  ihre  Rechte,  und  man  heftet  sich  an  die \r\nUmgebungen,  die  der  herrlichste  Tag  belebt.  Manchmal \r\nerinnere  ich  mich,  wie  der  Künstler  in  Norden  den  Stroh- \r\ndächern und  verfallenen  Schlössern  etwas  abzugewinnen \r\nsucht,  wie  man  sich  an  Bach  und  Busch  und  zerbröckel- \r\ntem Gestein  herumdrückt,  um  eine  malerische  Wirkung \r\nzu  erhaschen,  und  ich  komme  mir  ganz  wunderbar  vor, \r\num  so  mehr,  als  jene  Dinge  nach  so  langer  Gewohnheit \r\neinem  noch  immer  ankleben;  nun  habe  ich  mir  aber  seit \r\nvierzehn  Tagen  einen  Mut  gefaßt  und  bin  mit  kleinen \r\nBlättern  hinausgegangen,  durch  die  Tiefen  und  Höhen \r\nder  Villen,  und  habe  mir  ohne  viel  Besinnens  kleine  auf- \r\nfallende, wahrhaft  südliche  und  römische  Gegenstände \r\nentworfen  und  suche  nun,  mit  Hilfe  des  guten  Glücks, \r\nihnen  Licht  und  Schatten  zu  geben.  Es  ist  ganz  eigen, \r\ndaß  man  deutlich  sehen  und  wissen  kann,  was  gut  und \r\nbesser  ist;  wiU  man  sich's  aber  zueignen,  so  schwindet's \r\ngleichsam  unter  den  Händen,  und  wir  greifen  nicht  nach \r\ndem  Rechten,  sondern  nach  dem,  was  wir  zu  fassen  ge- \r\nwohnt sind.  Nur  durch  geregelte  Übung  könnte  man  vor- \r\nwärts kommen;  wo  aber  sollte  ich  Zeit  und  Sammlung \r\nfinden!  Indessen  fühle  ich  mich  denn  doch  durch  das \r\nleidenschaftliche,  vierzehntägige  Streben  um  vieles  ge- \r\nbessert. \r\n\r\nDie  Künstler  belehren  mich  gerne,  denn  ich  fasse  ge- \r\nschwind.  Nun  ist  aber  das  Gefaßte  nicht  gleich  geleistet: \r\n\r\n\r\n1 8  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\netwas  schnell  zu  begreifen,  ist  ja  ohnehin  die  Eigenschaft \r\ndes  Geistes,  aber  etwas  recht  zu  tun,  dazu  gehört  die \r\nÜbung  des  ganzen  Lebens. \r\n\r\nUnd  doch  soll  der  Liebhaber,  so  schwach  er  auch  nach- \r\nstrebt, sich  nicht  abschrecken  lassen.  Die  wenigen  Linien, \r\ndie  ich  aufs  Papier  ziehe,  oft  übereilt,  selten  richtig,  er- \r\nleichtern mir  jede  Vorstellung  von  sinnlichen  Dingen;  denn \r\nman  erhebt  sich  ja  eher  zum  Allgemeinen,  wenn  man  die \r\nGegenstände  genauer  und  schärfer  betrachtet. \r\nMit  dem  Künstler  nur  muß  man  sich  nicht  vergleichen, \r\nsondern  nach  seiner  eigenen  Art  verfahren;  denn  die \r\nNatur  hat  für  ihre  Kinder  gesorgt,  der  Geringste  wird \r\nnicht,  auch  durch  das  Dasein  des  Trefflichsten,  an  seinem \r\nDasein  gehindert:  \"Ein  kleiner  Mann  ist  auch  ein  Mann!\" \r\nund  dabei  wollen  wir's  denn  bewenden  lassen. \r\nIch  habe  zweimal  das  Meer  gesehn,  erst  das  Adriatische, \r\ndann  das  Mittländische,  nur  gleichsam  zum  Besuch.  In \r\nNeapel  wollen  wir  bekannter  werden.  Es  rückt  alles  auf \r\neinmal  in  mir  herauf;  warum  nicht  früher,  warum  nicht \r\nwohlfeiler!  Wie  viele  tausend  Sachen,  manche  ganz  neu \r\nund  von  vornen,  hätte  ich  mitzuteilen. \r\n\r\nDen  ly.  Februar. \r\nAbends  nach  vcrkliingener  Karnevalstorheit. \r\nIch  lasse  bei  meiner  Abreise  Moritzen  ungern  allein.  Er \r\nist  auf  gutem  Wege,  doch  wie  er  für  sich  geht,  so  sucht \r\ner  sich  gleich  beliebte  Schlupfwinkel.  Ich  habe  ihn  auf- \r\ngemuntert, an  Herdern  zu  schreiben;  der  Brief  liegt  bei: \r\nich  wünsche  eine  Antwort,  die  etwas  Dienliches  und \r\nHülfreiches  enthalte.  Es  ist  ein  sonderbar  guter  Mensch; \r\ner  wäre  viel  weiter,  wenn  er  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  Personen \r\ngefunden  hätte,  fähig  und  liebevoll  genug,  ihn  über  sei- \r\nnen Zustand  aufzuklären.  Gegenwärtig  kann  er  kein  ge- \r\nsegneteres Verhältnis  anknüpfen,  als  wenn  ihm  Herder \r\nerlaubt,  manchmal  zu  schreiben.  Er  beschäftigt  sich  mit \r\neinem  lobenswürdigen  antiquarischen  Unternehmen,  das \r\nwohl  verdient,  gefördert  zu  werden.  Freund  Herder  wird \r\nnicht  leicht  eine  Mühe  besser  angewendet  und  gute  Lehre \r\nkaum  in  einen  fruchtbarem  Boden  gelegt  haben. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  183 \r\n\r\nDas  große  Porträt,  welches  Tischbein  von  mir  unter- \r\nnommen, wächst  schon  aus  der  Leinwand  heraus.  Der \r\nKünstler  hat  sich  durch  einen  fertigen  Bildhauer  ein  klei- \r\nnes Modell  von  Ton  machen  lassen,  welches  gar  zierlich \r\nmit  einem  Mantel  drapiert  worden.  Darnach  malt  er \r\nfleißig;  denn  es  sollte  freilich  vor  unserer  Abreise  nach \r\nNeapel  schon  auf  einen  gewissen  Punkt  gebracht  sein, \r\nund  es  gehört  schon  Zeit  dazu,  eine  so  große  Leinwand \r\nmit  Farben  auch  nur  zu  bedecken. \r\n\r\nDen  ig.  Februar. \r\nDas  Wetter  fährt  fort,  über  allen  Ausdruck  schön  zu  sein; \r\nheute  war  ein  Tag,  den  ich  mit  Schmerzen  unter  den \r\nNarren  zubrachte.  Mit  Anbruch  der  Nacht  erholte  ich \r\nmich  auf  der  Villa  Medicis.  Neumond  ist  eben  vorbei, \r\nund  neben  der  zarten  Mondsichel  konnte  ich  die  ganze \r\ndunkle  Scheibe  fast  mit  bloßen  Augen,  durchs  Perspektiv \r\nganz  deutlich  sehn.  Über  der  Erde  schwebt  ein  Duft  des \r\nTags  über,  den  man  nur  aus  Gemälden  und  Zeichnungen \r\ndes  Claude  kennt,  das  Phänomen  in  der  Natur  aber  nicht \r\nleicht  so  schön  sieht  als  hier.  Nun  kommen  mir  Blumen \r\naus  der  Erde,  die  ich  noch  nicht  kenne,  und  neue  Blüten \r\nvon  den  Bäumen;  die  Mandeln  blühen  und  machen  eine \r\nneue  luftige  Erscheinung  zwischen  den  dunkelgrünen \r\nEichen;  der  Himmel  ist  wie  ein  hellblauer  Taft,  von  der \r\nSonne  beschienen.  Wie  wird  es  erst  in  Neapel  sein!  Wir \r\nfinden  das  meiste  schon  grün.  Meine  botanischen  Grillen \r\nbekräftigen  sich  an  allem  diesen,  und  ich  bin  auf  dem \r\nWege,  neue  schöne  Verhältnisse  zu  entdecken,  wie  die \r\nNatur  solch  ein  Ungeheures,  das  wie  nichts  aussieht,  aus \r\ndem  Einfachen  das  Mannigfaltigste  entwickelt. \r\nDer  Vesuv  wirft  Steine  und  Asche  aus,  und  bei  Nacht \r\nsieht  man  den  Gipfel  glühen.  Gebe  uns  die  wirkende \r\nNatur  einen  Lavafluß!  Nun  kann  ich  kaum  erwarten,  bis \r\nauch  diese  großen  Gegenstände  mir  eigen  werden. \r\n\r\nDen  21.  Februar.  Aschermittwoch. \r\nIch  benutze  die  Augenblicke  zwischen  dem  Einpacken, \r\num  noch  einiges  nachzuholen.     Morgen   gehn  wir  nach \r\n\r\n\r\ni84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nNeapel.  Ich  freue  mich  auf  das  Neue,  das  unaussprech- \r\nlich schön  sein  soll,  und  hoffe  in  jener  paradiesischen \r\nNatur  wieder  neue  Freiheit  und  Lust  zu  gewinnen,  hier \r\nim  ernsten  Rom  wieder  an  das  Studium  der  Kunst  zu \r\ngehen. \r\n\r\nDas  Einpacken  wird  mir  leicht;  ich  tue  es  mit  leichterem \r\nHerzen  als  vor  einem  halben  Jahre,  da  ich  mich  von \r\nallem  loslöste,  was  mir  so  lieb  und  wert  war.  Ja  es  ist \r\nschon  ein  halbes  Jahr,  und  von  den  vier  Monaten,  in \r\nRom  zugebracht,  habe  ich  keinen  Augenblick  verloren, \r\nwelches  zwar  viel  heißen  will,  aber  doch  nicht  zu  viel \r\ngesagt  ist. \r\n\r\nDaß  Iphigenia  angekommen,  weiß  ich;  möge  ich  am  Fuße \r\ndes  Vesuvs  erfahren,  daß  ihr  eine  gute  Aufnahme  zuteil \r\ngeworden. \r\n\r\nMit  Tischbein,  der  so  einen  herrlichen  Blick  in  Natur  als \r\nKunst  hat,  diese  Reise  zu  machen,  ist  für  mich  von  der \r\ngrößten  Wichtigkeit;  doch  können  wir,  als  echte  Deutsche, \r\nuns  doch  nicht  losmachen  von  Vorsätzen  und  Aussichten \r\nauf  Arbeit.  Das  schönste  Papier  ist  gekauft,  und  wir \r\nnehmen  uns  vor,  darauf  zu  zeichnen,  obgleich  die  Menge, \r\ndie  Schönheit  und  der  Glanz  der  Gegenstände  höchst \r\nwahrscheinlich  unserm  guten  Willen  Grenzen  setzt. \r\nEins  habe  ich  über  mich  gewonnen:  daß  ich  von  meinen \r\npoetischen  Arbeiten  nichts  mitnehme  als  Tasso  allein;  zu \r\nihm  habe  ich  die  beste  Hoffnung.  Wüßt  ich  nun,  was \r\nihr  zu  Iphigenien  sagt,  so  könnte  mir  dies  zur  Leitung \r\ndienen;  denn  es  ist  doch  eine  ähnliche  Arbeit,  der  Ge- \r\ngenstand fast  noch  beschränkter  als  jener,  und  will  im \r\neinzelnen  noch  mehr  ausgearbeitet  sein;  doch  weiß  ich \r\nnoch  nicht,  was  es  werden  kann.  Das  Vorhandene  muß \r\nich  ganz  zerstören;  das  hat  zu  lange  gelegen,  und  weder \r\ndie  Personen  noch  der  Plan  noch  der  Ton  haben  mit \r\nmeiner  jetzigen  Ansicht  die  mindeste  Verwandtschaft. \r\nBeim  Aufräumen  fallen  mir  einige  eurer  lieben  Briefe  in \r\ndie  Hand,  und  da  treffe  ich  beim  Durchlesen  auf  den \r\nVorwurf,  daß  ich  mir  in  meinen  Briefen  widerspreche. \r\nDas  kann  ich  zwar  nicht  merken — denn  was  ich  geschrie- \r\nben habe,  schicke  ich  gleich  fort — es  ist  mir  aber  selbst \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  185 \r\n\r\nsehr  wahrscheinlich;  denn  ich  werde  von  Ungeheuern \r\nMächten  hin  und  wider  geworfen,  und  da  ist  es  wohl \r\nnatürlich,  daß  ich  nicht  immer  weiß,  wo  ich  stehe. \r\nMan  erzählt  von  einem  Schiffer,  der,  von  einer  stürmi- \r\nschen Nacht  auf  der  See  überfallen,  nach  Hause  zu  steuern \r\ntrachtete.  Sein  Söhnchen,  in  der  Finsternis  an  ihn  ge- \r\nschmiegt, fragte:  Vater,  was  ist  denn  das  für  ein  närri- \r\nsches Lichtchen  dort,  das  ich  bald  über  uns,  bald  unter \r\nuns  sehe?  Der  Vater  versprach  ihm  die  Erklärung  des \r\nandern  Tags,  und  da  fand  es  sich,  daß  es  die  Flamme \r\ndes  Leuchtturms  gewesen,  die  einem  von  wilden  Wogen \r\nauf  und  nieder  geschaukelten  Auge  bald  unten,  bald  oben \r\nerschien. \r\n\r\nAuch  ich  steure  auf  einem  leidenschaftlich  bewegten \r\nMeere  dem  Hafen  zu,  und  halte  ich  die  Glut  des  Leucht- \r\nturms nur  scharf  im  Auge,  wenn  sie  mir  auch  den  Platz \r\nzu  verändern  scheint,  so  werde  ich  doch  zuletzt  am  Ufer \r\ngenesen. \r\n\r\nBei  der  Abreise  fällt  einem  doch  immer  jedes  frühere \r\nScheiden  und  auch  das  künftige  letzte  unwillkürlich  in \r\nden  Sinn,  und  mir  drängt  sich,  diesmal  stärker  als  sonst, \r\ndabei  die  Bemerkung  auf,  daß  wir  viel  zu  viel  Voran- \r\nstalten machen,  um  zu  leben;  denn  so  kehren  auch  wir, \r\nTischbein  und  ich,  so  vielen  Herrlichkeiten,  sogar  un- \r\nserm  wohlausgestatteten  eignen  Museum  den  Rücken. \r\nDa  stehn  nun  drei  Junonen  zur  Vergleichung  nebenein- \r\nander, und  wir  verlassen  sie,  als  wenn's  keine  wäre. \r\n\r\nNun  ist  der  Narrheit  ein  Ende.  Die  unzähligen  Lichter \r\ngestern  abend  waren  noch  ein  toller  Spektakel.  Das  Kar- \r\nneval in  Rom  muß  man  gesehen  haben,  um  den  Wunsch \r\nvöllig  loszuwerden,  es  je  wiederzusehen.  Zu  schreiben \r\nist  davon  gar  nichts,  bei  einer  mündlichen  Darstellung \r\nmöchte  es  allenfalls  unterhaltend  sein.  Was  man  dabei \r\nunangenehm  empfindet:  daß  die  innere  Fröhlichkeit  den \r\nMenschen  fehlt  und  es  ihnen  an  Geld  mangelt,  das  biß- \r\nchen Lust,  was  sie  noch  haben  mögen,  auszulassen.  Die \r\nGroßen  sind  ökonomisch  und  halten  zurück,  der  Mittel- \r\nmann  unvermögend,    das  Volk   lahm.     An  den   letzten \r\n\r\n\r\n1 8  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \r\n\r\nTagen  war  ein  unglaublicher  Liirm,  aber  keine  Herzens- \r\nfreude. Der  Himmel,  so  unendlich  rein  und  schön,  blickte \r\nso  edel  und  unschuldig  auf  diese  Possen. \r\nDa  man  aber  doch  das  Nachbilden  hier  nicht  lassen  kann, \r\nso  sind  zur  Lust  der  Kinder  Masken  des  Karnevals  und \r\nrömische  eigentümliche  Kleidungen  gezeichnet,  dann  mit \r\nFarben  angestrichen  worden,  da  sie  denn  ein  fehlendes \r\nKapitel  des  Orbis  pictus  den  lieben  Kleinen  ersetzen \r\nmögen. \r\n\r\n\r\nZWEITEIL  TEIL \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787 \r\n\r\nVelletri,  den  22.  Februar  lySy. \r\n\r\nBEI  guter  Zeit  sind  wir  hier  angelangt.  Schon  vor- \r\ngestern verfinsterte  sich  das  Wetter,  die  schönen \r\nTage  hatten  uns  trübe  gebracht;  doch  deuteten  einige \r\nLuftzeichen,  daß  es  sich  wieder  zum  Guten  bequemen \r\nwerde,  wie  es  denn  auch  eintraf.  Die  Wolken  trennten \r\nsich  nach  und  nach,  hier  und  da  erschien  der  blaue  Him- \r\nmel, und  endlich  beleuchtete  die  Sonne  unsere  Bahn. \r\nWir  kamen  durch  Albano,  nachdem  wir  vor  Genzano  an \r\ndem  Eingang  eines  Parks  gehalten  hatten,  den  Prinz  Chigi, \r\nder  Besitzer,  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  hält,  nicht  unter- \r\nhält, deshalb  auch  nicht  will,  daß  sich  jemand  darin  um- \r\nsehe. Hier  bildet  sich  eine  wahre  Wildnis:  Bäume  und \r\nGesträuche,  Kräuter  und  Ranken  wachsen,  wie  sie  wollen, \r\nverdorren,  stürzen  um,  verfaulen;  das  ist  alles  recht  und \r\nnur  desto  besser.  Der  Platz  vor  dem  Eingang  ist  un- \r\nsäglich schön.  Eine  hohe  Mauer  schließt  das  Tal,  eine \r\nvergitterte  Pforte  läßt  hineinblicken,  dann  steigt  der  Hü- \r\ngel aufwärts,  wo  dann  oben  das  Schloß  liegt.  Es  gäbe \r\ndas  größte  Bild,  wenn  es  ein  rechter  Künstler  unter- \r\nnähme. \r\n\r\nNun  darf  ich  nicht  weiter  beschreiben  und  sage  nur,  daß, \r\nals  wir  von  der  Höhe  die  Gebirge  von  Sezza,  die  Pon- \r\ntinischen  Sümpfe,  das  Meer  und  die  Inseln  erblickten, \r\ndaß  in  dem  Moment  ein  starker  Streifregen  über  die \r\nSümpfe  nach  dem  Meer  zog,  Licht  und  Schatten,  abwech- \r\nselnd und  bewegt,  die  öde  Fläche  gar  mannigfaltig  be- \r\nlebten. Sehr  schön  wirkten  hiezu  mehrere  von  der  Sonne \r\nerleuchtete  Rauchsäulen,  die  aus  zerstreuten,  kaum  sicht- \r\nbaren Hütten  emporstiegen. \r\n\r\nVelletri  liegt  sehr  angenehm  auf  einem  vulkanischen \r\nHügel,  der  nur  gegen  Norden  mit  andern  zusammen- \r\nhängt, über  drei  Himmelsgegenden  aber  den  freisten  An- \r\nblick gewährt. \r\n\r\nNun  besahen  wir  das  Kabinett  des  Cavaliere  Borgia, \r\nwelcher,  begünstigt  durch  die  Verwandtschaft  mit  dem \r\nKardinal  und  der  Propaganda,  treffliche  Altertümer  und \r\nsonstige  Merkwürdigkeiten  hier  zusammenstellen  konnte: \r\n\r\n\r\nI90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nägyptische  Götzen,  aus  dem  härtesten  Steine  gebildet, \r\nkleinere  Metallfignren  früherer  und  späterer  Zeit,  in  der \r\nGegend  ausgegrabene,  aus  Ton  gebrannte,  flach  erhobene \r\nBildwerke,  durch  welche  veranlaßt  man  den  alten  Vols- \r\nkern  einen  eignen  Stil  zuschreiben  will. \r\nVon  allerlei  andern  Raritäten  besitzt  das  Museum  man- \r\ncherlei. Ich  merkte  mir  zwei  chinesische  Tuschkästchen, \r\nwo  auf  den  Stücken  des  einen  die  ganze  Zucht  der  Seiden- \r\nwürmer, auf  dem  andern  der  Reisbau  vorgestellt  ist,  beides \r\nhöchst  naiv  genommen  und  ausführlich  gearbeitet.  Das \r\nKästchen  sowie  die  Einwicklung  desselben  sind  ausneh- \r\nmend schön  und  dürfen  sich  neben  dem  von  mir  schon \r\ngelobten  Buch  auf  der  Bibliothek  der  Propaganda  wohl \r\nsehen  lassen. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  freilich  unverantwortlich,  daß  man  diesen  Schatz \r\nso  nahe  bei  Rom  hat  und  denselben  nicht  öfter  besucht. \r\nDoch  mag  die  Unbequemlichkeit  einer  jeden  Ausflucht  in \r\ndiesen  Gegenden  und  die  Gewalt  des  römischen  Zauber- \r\nkreises zur  Entschuldigung  dienen.  Als  wir  nach  der \r\nHerberge  gingen,  riefen  uns  einige  vor  ihren  Haustüren \r\nsitzende  Weiber  an,  ob  wir  nicht  auch  Altertümer  zu \r\nkaufen  Lust  hätten,  und  als  wir  uns  darnach  sehr  be- \r\ngierig erwiesen,  holten  sie  alte  Kessel,  Feuerzange  nebst \r\nanderem  schlechten  Hausgeräte  und  wollten  sich  zu  Tod \r\nlachen,  uns  angeführt  zu  haben.  Als  wir  uns  deshalb \r\nentrüsteten,  brachte  unser  Führer  die  Sache  wieder  ins \r\nGleiche;  denn  er  versicherte,  daß  dieser  Spaß  hergebracht \r\nsei  und  daß  alle  Fremden  denselben  Tribut  entrichten \r\nmüßten. \r\n\r\nDies  schreib  ich  in  einer  sehr  Übeln  Herberge  und  fühle \r\nin  mir  weder  Kraft  noch  Behagen,  weiter  fortzufahren. \r\nAlso  die  freundlichste  gute  Nacht! \r\n\r\nFondi,  den  ^j.  Februar. \r\nSchon  früh  um  drei  Uhr  waren  wir  auf  dem  Wege.  Als \r\nes  tagte,  fanden  wir  uns  in  den  Pontinischen  Sümpfen, \r\nwelche  kein  so  übles  Anschn  haben,  als  man  sie  in  Rom \r\ngemeiniglich  beschreibt.  Man  kann  zwar  ein  so  großes \r\nund  weitläuftiges  Unternehmen,  als  die  beabsichtigte  Aus- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  17  87  191 \r\n\r\ntrocknung  ist,  auf  der  Durchreise  nicht  beurteilen;  allein \r\nes  scheint  mir  doch,  daß  die  Arbeiten,  welche  der  Papst \r\nangeordnet,  die  gewünschten  Endzwecke  wenigstens  zum \r\ngrößten  Teil  erreichen  werden.  Man  denke  sich  ein  weites \r\nTal,  das  sich  von  Norden  nach  Süden  mit  wenigem  Falle \r\nhinzieht,  ostwärts  gegen  die  Gebirge  zu  vertieft,  westwärts \r\naber  gegen  das  Meer  zu  erhöht  liegt. \r\nDer  ganzen  Länge  nach  in  gerader  Linie  ist  die  alte  Via \r\nAppia  wiederhergestellt,  an  der  rechten  Seite  derselben \r\nder  Hauptkanal  gezogen,  und  das  Wasser  fließt  darin  ge- \r\nlind hinab:  dadurch  ist  das  Erdreich  der  rechten  Seite \r\nnach  dem  Meere  zu  ausgetrocknet  und  dem  Feldbau  über- \r\nantwortet; so  weit  das  Auge  sehen  kann,  ist  es  bebaut  oder \r\nkönnte  es  werden,  wenn  sich  Pächter  fänden,  einige  Flecke \r\nausgenommen,  die  allzutief  liegen. \r\n\r\nDie  linke  Seite  nach  dem  Gebirg  zu  ist  schon  schwerer  zu \r\nbehandeln.  Zwar  gehen  Querkanäle  unter  der  Chaussee \r\nin  den  Hauptkanal;  da  jedoch  der  Boden  gegen  die  Berge \r\nzu  abfällt,  so  kann  er  auf  diese  Weise  nicht  vom  Wasser \r\nbefreit  werden.  Man  will,  sagt  man,  einen  zweiten  Kanal \r\nam  Gebirge  herführen.  Große  Strecken,  besonders  gegen \r\nTerracina,  sind  mit  Weiden  und  Pappeln  angeflogen. \r\nEine  Poststation  besteht  aus  einer  bloßen  langen  Stroh- \r\nhütte. Tischbein  zeichnete  sie  und  genoß  zur  Belohnung \r\ndafür  ein  Vergnügen,  das  nur  er  völlig  zu  genießen  weiß. \r\nAuf  dem  abgetrockneten  Terrain  hatte  sich  ein  Schimmel \r\nlosgemacht,  der,  sich  seiner  Freiheit  bedienend,  auf  dem \r\nbraunen  Boden  wie  ein  Lichtstrahl  hin  und  wider  fuhr; \r\nwirklich  war  es  ein  herrlicher  Anblick,  durch  Tischbeins \r\nEntzücken  erst  recht  bedeutend. \r\n\r\nDa,  wo  sonst  der  OrtMeza  stand,  hat  der  Papst  ein  großes \r\nund  schönes  Gebäude,  als  den  Mittelpunkt  der  Fläche  be- \r\nzeichnend, aufrichten  lassen.  Der  Anblick  desselben  ver- \r\nmehrt Hoffnung  und  Zutrauen  für  das  ganze  Unternehmen. \r\nUnd  so  rückten  wir  immer  fort,  uns  lebhaft  unterhaltend, \r\nwohl  eingedenk  der  Warnung,  daß  man  auf  diesem  Wege \r\nnicht  einschlafen  dürfe;  und  freihch  erinnerte  uns  der \r\nblaue  Dunst,  der  schon  in  dieser  Jahrszeit  in  gewisser \r\nHöhe  über  dem  Boden  schwebte,  an  eine  gefährliche  Luft- \r\n\r\n\r\n192  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSchicht.  Desto  erfreulicher  und  erwünschter  war  uns  die \r\nFelsenlage  von  Terracina;  und  kaum  hatten  wir  uns  daran \r\nvergnügt,  als  wir  das  Meer  gleich  davor  erblickten.  Kurz \r\ndarauf  ließ  uns  die  andere  Seite  des  Stadtberges  ein \r\nSchauspiel  neuer  Vegetation  sehen.  Indianische  Feigen \r\ntrieben  ihre  großen,  fetten  Blätterkörper  zwischen  nie- \r\ndrigen graulichgrünen  Myrten,  unter  gelbgrünen  Granat- \r\nbäumen und  fahlgrünen  Olivenzweigen.  Am  Wege  sahen \r\nwir  neue,  noch  nie  gesehene  Blumen  und  Sträuche.  Nar- \r\nzissen und  Adonis  blühten  auf  den  Wiesen.  Man  behält \r\ndas  Meer  eine  Zeitlang  rechts;  die  Kalkfelsen  aber  bleiben \r\nlinks  in  der  Nähe.  Diese  sind  die  Fortsetzung  der  Apen- \r\nninen,  welche  sich  von  Tivoli  herziehen  und  ans  Meer \r\nanschließen,  wovon  sie,  erst  durch  die  Campagna  di \r\nRoma,  dann  durch  die  Frascatanischen,  Albanischen, \r\nVelletrischen  Vulkane  und  endlich  durch  die  Pontinischen \r\nSümpfe  getrennt  wurden.  Der  Monte  Circello,  das  Vor- \r\ngebirg  Terracina  gegenüber,  wo  die  Pontinischen  Sümpfe \r\nsich  endigen,  mag  gleichfalls  aus  gereihten  Kalkfelsen  be- \r\nstehen. \r\n\r\nWir  verließen  das  Meer  und  kamen  bald  in  die  reizende \r\nEbene  von  Fondi.  Dieser  kleine  Raum  fruchtbaren  und \r\nbebauten  Erdreichs,  von  einem  nicht  allzurauhen  Gebirg \r\numschlossen,  muß  jedermann  anlachen.  Noch  hängt  die \r\nMehrzahl  der  Orangen  an  den  Bäumen,  die  Saat  steht \r\ngrün,  durchaus  Weizen;  Oliven  auf  den  Äckern,  das \r\nStädtchen  im  Grunde.  Ein  Palmbaum  zeichnet  sich  aus \r\nund  ward  begrüßt.  So  viel  für  diesen  Abend.  Verzeihung \r\nder  laufenden  Feder!  Ich  muß  schreiben,  ohne  zu  denken, \r\ndamit  ich  nur  schreibe.  Der  Gegenstände  sind  zu  viel, \r\nder  Aufenthalt  zu  schlecht,  und  doch  meine  Begierde  all- \r\nzugroß, einiges  dem  Papiere  anzuvertrauen.  Mit  ein- \r\nbrechender Nacht  kamen  wir  an,  und  es  ist  nun  Zeit,  ^uhe \r\nzu  suchen. \r\n\r\nSanf  Agata,  den  24.  Feuruar. \r\nIn  einer  kalten  Kammer  muß  ich  Nachricht  von  einem \r\nschönen  Tage  geben.  Als  wir  aus  Fondi  herausfuhren, \r\nward  es  eben  helle,  und  wir  wurden  sogleich  durch  die \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  193 \r\n\r\nüber  die  Mauern  hängenden  Pomeranzen  auf  beiden  Sei- \r\nten des  Wegs  begrüßt.  Die  Bäume  hängen  so  voll,  als \r\nman  sich's  nur  denken  kann.  Obenher  ist  das  junge \r\nLaub  gelblich,  unten  aber  und  in  der  Mitte  von  dem  saf- \r\ntigsten Grün.  Mignon  hatte  wohl  recht,  sich  dahin  zu \r\nsehnen. \r\n\r\nDann  fuhren  wir  durch  wohlgeackerte  undbestellteWeizen- \r\nfelder,  in  schicklichen  Räumen  mit  Oliven  bepflanzt.  Der \r\nWind  bewegte  sie  und  brachte  die  silberne  Unterfläche  der \r\nBlätter  ans  Licht,  die  Äste  bogen  sich  leicht  und  zierlich. \r\nEs  war  ein  grauer  Morgen,  ein  starker  Nordwind  versprach, \r\nalles  Gewölk  völlig  zu  vertreiben. \r\n\r\nDann  zog  der  Weg  im  Tale  hin,  zwischen  steinigen,  aber \r\ngut  gebauten  Ackern,  die  Saat  vom  schönsten  Grün.  An \r\neinigen  Orten  sah  man  geräumige,  runde,  gepflastertePlätze, \r\nmit  niedrigen  Mäuerchen  umgeben;  hier  drischt  man  die \r\nFrucht  sogleich  aus,  ohne  sie  in  Garben  nach  Hause  zu \r\nfahren.  Das  Tal  ward  schmäler,  der  Weg  ging  bergan \r\nKalkfelsen  standen  nackt  an  beiden  Seiten.  Der  Sturm \r\nwar  heftiger  hinter  uns  her.  Es  fielen  Graupeln,  die  sehr \r\nlangsam  tauten. \r\n\r\nEinige  Mauern  antiker  Gebäude  mit  netzförmiger  Arbeit \r\nüberraschten  uns.  Auf  der  Höhe  sind  die  Plätze  felsig, \r\ndoch  mit  Olivenbäumen  bepflanzt,  wo  nur  das  geringste \r\nErdreich  sie  aufnehmen  konnte.  Nun  über  eine  Plaine \r\nmit  Oliven,  sodann  durch  ein  Städtchen.  Eingemauert \r\nfanden  wir  nun  Altäre,  antike  Grabsteine,  Fragmente  aller \r\nArt  in  den  Gartenumfriedigungen,  dann  treftlich  ge- \r\nmauerte, jetzt  aber  mit  Erdreich  ausgefüllte  Untergeschosse \r\nalter  Landhäuser,  nunmehr  von  Olivenwäldchen  bewach- \r\nsen. Dann  erblickten  wir  den  Vesuv,  eine  Rauchwolke \r\nauf  seinem  Scheitel. \r\n\r\nMola  di  Gaeta  begrüßte  uns  abermals  mit  den  reichsten \r\nPomeranzenbäumen.  Wir  blieben  einige  Stunden.  Die \r\nBucht  vor  dem  Städtchen  gewährt  eine  der  schönsten  Aus- \r\nsichten, das  Meer  spült  bis  heran.  Folgt  das  Auge  dem \r\nrechten  Ufer  und  erreicht  es  zuletzt  das  Hörnende  des \r\nhalben  ]Mondes,  so  sieht  man  auf  einem  Felsen  die  Festung \r\nGaeta,  in  mäßiger  Ferne.    Das  linke  Hörn  erstreckt  sich \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  13 \r\n\r\n\r\n194  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nviel  weiter;  erst  sieht  man  eine  Reihe  Gebirge,  dann  den \r\nVesuv,  dann  die  Inseln.  Ischia  liegt  fast  der  Mitte  gegen- \r\nüber. \r\n\r\nHier  fand  ich  am  Ufer  die  ersten  Seesteme  und  Seeigel \r\nausgespült,  ein  schönes  grünes  Blatt  wie  das  feinste  Velin- \r\npapier, dann  aber  merkwürdige  Geschiebe:  am  häufigsten \r\ndie  gewöhnlichen  Kalksteine,  sodann  aber  auch  Serpentin, \r\nJaspis,  Quarze,  Kieselbreccien,  Granite,  Porphyre,  Mar- \r\nmorarten, Glas  von  grüner  und  blauer  Farbe.  Die  zuletzt \r\ngenannten  Steinarten  sind  schwerlich  in  dieser  Gegend \r\nerzeugt,  sind  wahrscheinlich  Trümmern  alter  Gebäude, \r\nund  so  sehen  wir  denn,  wie  die  Welle  vor  unsern  Augen \r\nmit  den  Herrlichkeiten  der  Vorwelt  spielen  darf.  Wir \r\nverweilten  gern  und  hatten  unsere  Lust  an  der  Natur  der \r\nMenschen,  die  sich  beinahe  als  Wilde  betrugen.  Von  Mola \r\nsich  entfernend,  hat  man  immer  schöne  Aussicht,  wenn \r\nsich  auch  das  Meer  verliert.  Der  letzte  Blick  darauf  ist \r\neine  liebliche  Seebucht,  die  gezeichnet  ward.  Nun  folgt \r\ngutes  Fruchtfeld,  mit  Aloen  eingezäunt.  Wir  erblickten \r\neine  Wasserleitung,  die  sich  vom  Gebirg  her  nach  unkennt- \r\nlichen, verworrenen  Ruinen  zog. \r\n\r\nDann  folgt  die  Überfahrt  über  den  Fluß  Garigliano.  Man \r\nwandert  sodann  durch  ziemlich  fruchtbare  Gegenden  auf \r\nein  Gebirg  los.  Nichts  Auffallendes.  Endlich  der  erste \r\nvulkanische  Aschenhügel.  Hier  beginnt  eine  große  herr- \r\nliche Gegend  von  Bergen  und  Gründen,  über  welche  zuletzt \r\nSchneegipfel  hervorragen.  Auf  der  näheren  Höhe  eine \r\nlange,  wohl  in  die  Augen  fallende  Stadt.  In  dem  Tal  liegt \r\nSant'  Agata,  ein  ansehnlicher  Gasthof,  wo  ein  lebhaftes \r\nFeuer  in  einem  Kamin,  das  als  Kabinett  angelegt  ist, \r\nbrannte.  Indessen  ist  unsere  Stube  kalt,  keine  Fenster, \r\nnur  Läden;  und  ich  eile,  zu  schließen. \r\n\r\nNeapel,  den  25.  Februar. \r\n\r\nEndlich  auch  hier  glücklich  und  mit  guten  Vorbedeu- \r\ntungenangekommen. Von  der  Tagesreise  nur  soviel:  Sant' \r\nAgata  verließen  wir  mit  Sonnenaufgang;  der  Wind  blies \r\nheftig  hinter  uns  her,  und  dieser  Nordost  hielt  den  ganzen \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  195 \r\n\r\nTag  an.  Erst  Nachmittag  ward  er  Herr  von  den  Wolken; \r\nwir  litten  von  Kälte. \r\n\r\nUnser  Weg  ging  wieder  durch  und  über  vulkanische  Hügel, \r\nwo  ich  nur  noch  wenige  Kalkfelsen  zu  bemerken  glaubte. \r\nEndlich  erreichten  wir  die  Plaine  von  Capua,  bald  dar- \r\nnach Capua  selbst,  wo  wir  Mittag  hielten.  Nachmittag \r\ntat  sich  ein  schönes,  flaches  Feld  vor  uns  auf.  Die  Chaussee \r\ngeht  breit  zwischen  grünen  Weizenfeldern  durch,  der \r\nWeizen  ist  wie  ein  Teppich  und  wohl  spannenhoch.  Pap- \r\npeln sind  reihenweis  auf  den  Feldern  gepflanzt,  hoch \r\nausgezweigt  und  Wein  hinangezogen.  So  geht  es  bis \r\nNeapel  hinein.  Ein  klarer,  herrlich-lockerer  Boden  und \r\ngut  bearbeitet.  Die  Weinstöcke  von  ungewöhnlicher  Stcärke \r\nund  Höhe,  die  Ranken  wie  Netze  von  Pappel  zu  Pappel \r\nschwebend. \r\n\r\nDer  Vesuv  blieb  uns  immer  zur  linken  Seite,  gewaltsam \r\ndampfend!  und  ich  war  still  für  mich  erfreut,  daß  ich  diesen \r\nmerkwürdigen  Gegenstand  endlich  auch  mit  Augen  sah. \r\nDer  Himmel  ward  immer  klärer,  und  zuletzt  schien  die \r\nSonne  recht  heiß  in  unsere  enge,  rollende  Wohnung.  Bei \r\nganz  rein-heller  Atmosphäre  kamen  wir  Neapel  näher, \r\nund  nun  fanden  wir  uns  wirklich  in  einem  andern  Lande. \r\nDie  Gebäude  mit  flachen  Dächern  deuten  auf  eine  andere \r\nHimmelsgegend;  inwendig  mögen  sie  nicht  sehr  freundlich \r\nsein.  Alles  ist  auf  der  Straße,  sitzt  in  der  Sonne,  so  lange \r\nsie  scheinen  will.  Der  Neapolitaner  glaubt  im  Besitz  des \r\nParadieses  zu  sein  und  hat  von  den  nördlichen  Ländern \r\neinen  sehr  traurigen  Begriff:  Sempre  neve,  case  di  legno, \r\ngran  ignoranza,  ma  danari  assai.  Solch  ein  Bild  machen \r\nsie  sich  von  unserm  Zustande.  Zur  Erbauung  sämtlicher \r\ndeutschen  Völkerschaften  heißt  diese  Charakteristik  über- \r\nsetzt: Immer  Schnee,  hölzerne  Häuser,  große  Unwissen- \r\nheit, aber  Geld  genug. \r\n\r\nNeapel  selbst  kündigt  sich  froh,  frei  und  lebhaft  an;  un- \r\nzählige Menschen  rennen  durcheinander,  der  König  ist \r\nauf  der  Jagd,  die  Königin  guter  Hoffnung,  und  so  kann's \r\nnicht  besser  gehn. \r\n\r\n\r\n196  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nMontag  den  26.  Februar. \r\nAlla  Locanda  del  Sgr.  Moriconi  al  Largo  del  Castello. \r\nUnter  dieser  ebenso  heiter  als  prächtig  klingenden  Auf- \r\nschrift würden  uns  Briefe  aus  allen  vier  Teilen  der  Welt \r\nnunmehr  auffinden.  In  der  Gegend  des  am  Meere  liegen- \r\nden großen  Kastells  erstreckt  sich  eine  große  Weitung, \r\ndie  man,  obgleich  von  allen  vier  Seiten  mit  Häusern \r\numgeben,  nicht  Platz,  sondern  Weite  (largo)  genannt  hat, \r\nwahrscheinlicherweise  von  den  ersten  Zeiten  her,  da \r\ndieses  noch  ein  unbegrenztes  Feld  war.  Hier  nun  tritt  an \r\nder  einen  Seite  ein  großes  Eckhaus  herein,  und  wir  faßten \r\nFuß  in  einem  geräumigen  Ecksaale,  der  einen  freien  und \r\nfrohen  Überblick  über  die  immer  bewegte  Fläche  gewährt. \r\nEin  eiserner  Balkon  zieht  sich  außen  an  mehrern  Fenstern \r\nvorbei,  selbst  um  die  Ecke  hin.  Man  würde  davon  nicht \r\nwegkommen,  wenn  der  scharfe  Wind  nicht  äußerst  fühl- \r\nbar wäre. \r\n\r\nDer  Saal  ist  munter  dekoriert,  besonders  aber  die  Decke, \r\nderen  Arabesken  in  hundert  Abteilungen  schon  die  Nähe \r\nvon  Pompeji  und  Herkulanum  verkünden.  Das  wäre \r\nnun  alles  schön  und  gut;  aber  keine  Feuerstätte,  kein \r\nKamin  ist  zu  bemerken,  und  der  Februar  übt  denn  doch \r\nauch  hier  seine  Rechte.  Ich  sehnte  mich  nach  einiger \r\nErwärmung. \r\n\r\nMan  brachte  mir  einen  Dreifuß,  von  der  Erde  dergestalt \r\nerhöht,  daß  man  die  Hände  bequem  darüber  halten  konnte. \r\nAuf  demselben  war  ein  flaches  Becken  befestigt;  dieses \r\nenthielt  ganz  zarte  glühende  Kohlen,  gar  glatt  mit  Asche \r\nbedeckt.  Hier  gilt  es  nun  haushältig  sein,  wie  wir  es  in \r\nRom  schon  gelernt.  Mit  dem  Ohr  eines  Schlüssels  zieht \r\nman  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  die  oberflächliche  Asche  behutsam \r\nweg,  so  daß  von  den  Kohlen  wieder  etwas  an  die  freie \r\nLuft  gelange.  Wollte  man  jedoch  ungeduldig  die  Glut \r\naufwühlen,  so  würde  man  einen  Augenblick  größere  Wärme \r\nspüren,  aber  sehr  bald  die  ganze  Glut  erschöpft  haben, \r\nda  denn  das  Becken  abermals,  gegen  Erlegung  einer  ge- \r\nwissen Summe,  zu  füllen  wäre. \r\nIch  befand  mich  nicht  ganz  wohl  und  hätte  freilich  mehr \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  197 \r\n\r\nBequemlichkeit  gewünsdit.  Eine  Schilfmatte  diente  gegen \r\ndie  Einflüsse  des  Estrichs;  Pelze  sind  nicht  gewöhnlich, \r\nund  ich  entschloß  mich,  eine  Schifferkutte,  die  wir  aus \r\nScherz  mitgenommen  hatten,  anzuziehen,  die  mir  gute \r\nDienste  leistete,  besonders  nachdem  ich  sie  mit  einem \r\nKofiferstrick  um  den  Leib  befestigt  hatte;  da  ich  mir  denn \r\nals  Mittelding  zwischen  Matrosen  und  Kapuziner  sehr \r\nkomisch  vorkommen  mußte.  Tischbein,  der  von  Besuchen \r\nbei  Freunden  zurückkehrte,  konnte  sich  des  Lachens  nicht \r\nenthalten. \r\n\r\nDen  2y.  Februar. \r\nGestern  bracht  ich  den  Tag  in  Ruhe  zu,  um  eine  kleine \r\nkörperliche  Unbequemlichkeit  erst  abzuwarten;  heute  ward \r\ngeschwelgt  und  die  Zeit  mit  Anschauung  der  herrlichsten \r\nGegenstände  zugebracht.  Man  sage,  erzähle,  male,  was \r\nman  will  —  hier  ist  mehr  als  alles.  Die  Ufer,  Buchten \r\nund  Busen  des  Meeres,  der  Vesuv,  die  Stadt,  die  Vor- \r\nstädte, die  Kastelle,  die  Lusträume!  —  Wir  sind  auch \r\nnoch  abends  in  die  Grotte  des  Posilipo  gegangen,  da  eben \r\ndie  untergehende  Sonne  zur  andern  Seite  hereinschien. \r\nIch  verzieh  es  allen,  die  in  Neapel  von  Sinnen  kommen, \r\nund  erinnerte  mich  mit  Rührung  meines  Vaters,  der  einen \r\nunauslöschlichen  Eindruck  besonders  von  denen  Gegen- \r\nständen, die  ich  heut  zum  erstenmal  sah,  erhalten  hatte. \r\nUnd  wie  man  sagt,  daß  einer,  dem  ein  Gespenst  erschie- \r\nnen, nicht  wieder  froh  wird,  so  konnte  man  umgekehrt \r\nvon  ihm  sagen,  daß  er  nie  ganz  unglücklich  werden  konnte, \r\nweil  er  sich  immer  wieder  nach  Neapel  dachte.  Ich  bin \r\nnun  nach  meiner  Art  ganz  stille  und  mache  nur,  wenn's \r\ngar  zu  toll  wird,  große,  große  Augen. \r\n\r\nDen  28.  Februar. \r\nHeute  besuchten  wir  Philipp  Hackert,den  berühmten  Land- \r\nschaftsmaler, der  eines  besondern  Vertrauens,  einer  vor- \r\nzüglichen Gnade  des  Königs  und  der  Königin  genießt. \r\nMan  hat  ihm  einen  Flügel  des  Palasts  Francavilla  einge- \r\nräumt, den  er  mit  Künstlergeschmack  möblieren  ließ  und \r\nmit  Zufriedenheit  bewohnt.    Es  ist  ein  sehr  bestimmter, \r\n\r\n\r\n198  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nkluger  Mann,  der  bei  unausgesetztem  Fleiß  das  Leben  zu \r\ngenießen  versteht. \r\n\r\nDann  gingen  wir  ans  Meer  und  sahen  allerlei  Fische  und \r\nwunderliche  Gestalten  aus  den  Wellen  ziehen.  Der  Tag \r\nwar  herrlich,  die  Tramontane  leidlich. \r\n\r\nDen  I.  März. \r\nSchon  in  Rom  hatte  man  meinem  eigensinnigen  Einsiedler- \r\nsinne, mehr  als  mir  lieb  war,  eine  gesellige  Seite  abge- \r\nwonnen. Freilich  scheint  es  ein  wunderlich  Beginnen, \r\ndaß  man  in  die  Welt  geht,  um  allein  bleiben  zu  wollen. \r\nSo  hatte  ich  denn  auch  dem  Fürsten  von  Waldeck  nicht \r\nwiderstehen  können,  der  mich  aufs  freundlichste  einlud \r\nund  durch  Rang  und  Einfluß  mir  Teilnahme  an  manchem \r\nGuten  verschaffte.  Kaum  waren  wir  in  Neapel  ange- \r\nkommen, wo  er  sich  schon  eine  Zeitlang  aufhielt,  als  er \r\nuns  einladen  ließ,  mit  ihm  eine  Fahrt  nach  Pozzuoli  und \r\nder  anliegenden  Gegend  zu  machen.  Ich  dachte  heute \r\nschon  auf  den  Vesuv;  Tischbein  aber  nötigt  mich  zu  jener \r\nFahrt,  die,  an  und  für  sich  angenehm,  bei  dem  schönsten \r\nWetter,  in  Gesellschaft  eines  so  vollkommenen  und  unter- \r\nrichteten Fürsten,  sehr  viel  Freude  und  Nutzen  verspricht. \r\nAuch  haben  wir  schon  in  Rom  eine  schöne  Dame  ge- \r\nsehen, nebst  ihrem  Gemahl,  von  dem  Fürsten  unzertrenn- \r\nlich; diese  soll  gleichfalls  von  der  Partie  sein,  und  man \r\nhofil't  alles  Erfreuliche. \r\n\r\nAuch  bin  ich  dieser  edlen  Gesellschaft  durch  frühere  Un- \r\nterhaltung genauer  bekannt.  Der  Fürst  nämlich  fragte  bei \r\nunserer  ersten  Bekanntschaft,  womit  ich  mich  jetzt  be- \r\nschäftige, und  meine  Iphigenia  war  mir  so  gegenwärtig, \r\ndaß  ich  sie  einen  Abend  umständlich  genug  erzählen \r\nkonnte.  Man  ging  darauf  ein,  aber  ich  glaubte  doch  zu \r\nmerken,  daß  man  etwas  Lebhafteres,  Wilderes  von  mir \r\nerwartet  hatte. \r\n\r\nAbends. \r\nVon  dem  heutigen  Tage  wäre  schwerlich  Rechenschaft \r\nzu  geben.  Wer  hat  es  nicht  erfahren,  daß  die  flüchtige \r\nLesung  eines  Buchs,  das  ihn  unwiderstehlich  fortriß,  auf \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  199 \r\n\r\nsein  ganzes  Leben  den  größten  Einfluß  hatte  und  schon \r\ndie  Wirkung  entschied,  zu  der  Wiederlesen  und  ernst- \r\nliches Betrachten  kaum  in  der  Folge  mehr  hinzutun  konnte. \r\nSo  ging  es  mir  einst  mit  Sakontala,  und  geht  es  uns  mit \r\nbedeutenden  Menschen  nicht  gleicherweiser  Eine  Wasser- \r\nfahrt bis  Pozzuoli,  leichte  Landfahrten,  heitere  Spazier- \r\ngänge durch  die  wundersamste  Gegend  von  der  Welt. \r\nUnterm  reinsten  Himmel  der  unsicherste  Boden.  Trüm- \r\nmern undenkbarer  Wohlhiibigkeit,  zerlästert  und  un- \r\nerfreulich. Siedende  Wasser,  Schwefel  aushauchende \r\nGrüfte,  dem  Pflanzenleben  widerstrebende  Schlacken- \r\nberge, kahle,  widerliche  Räume  und  dann  doch  zuletzt \r\neine  immer  üppige  Vegetation,  eingreifend,  wo  sie  nur \r\nirgend  vermag,  sich  über  alles  Ertötete  erhebend,  um \r\nLandseen  und  Bäche  umher,  ja  den  herrlichsten  Eichwald \r\nan  den  Wänden  eines  alten  Kraters  behauptend. \r\nUnd  so  wird  man  zwischen  Natur-  und  Völkerereignissen \r\nhin  und  wider  getrieben.  Man  wünscht  zu  denken  und \r\nfühlt  sich  dazu  zu  ungeschickt.  Indessen  lebt  der  Leben- \r\ndige lustig  fort,  woran  wir  es  denn  auch  nicht  fehlen \r\nließen.  Gebildete  Personen,  der  Welt  und  ihrem  Wesen \r\nangehörend,  aber  auch,  durch  ernstes  Geschick  gewarnt, \r\nzu  Betrachtungen  aufgelegt.  Unbegrenzter  Blick  über \r\nLand,  Meer  und  Himmel,  zurückgerufen  in  die  Nähe  einer \r\nliebenswürdigen  jungen  Dame,  Huldigung  anzunehmen \r\ngewohnt  und  geneigt. \r\n\r\nUnter  allem  diesem  Taumel  jedoch  verfehlt  ich  nicht, \r\nmanches  anzumerken.  Zu  künftiger  Redaktion  wird  die \r\nan  Ort  und  Stelle  benutzte  Karte  und  eine  flüchtige  Zeich- \r\nnung von  Tischbein  die  beste  Hilfe  geben;  heute  ist  mir \r\nnicht  möglich,  auch  nur  das  mindeste  hinzuzufügen. \r\n\r\nDen  2.  März \r\nbestieg  ich  den  Vesuv,  obgleich  bei  trübem  Wetter  und \r\numwölktem  Gipfel.  Fahrend  gelangt  ich  nach  Resina, \r\nsodann  auf  einem  Maultiere  den  Berg  zwischen  Wein- \r\ngärten hinauf;  nun  zu  Fuß  über  die  Lava  vom  Jahre  ein- \r\nundsiebenzig,  die  schon  feines,  aber  festes  Moos  auf \r\nsich  erzeugt  hatte;  dann  an  der  Seite  der  Lava  her.    Die \r\n\r\n\r\n2  00  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nHütte  des  Einsiedlers  blieb  mir  links  auf  der  Höhe. \r\nFerner  den  Aschenberg  hinauf,  welches  eine  saure  Arbeit \r\nist.  Zwei  Dritteile  dieses  Gipfels  waren  mit  Wolken  be- \r\ndeckt. Endlich  erreichten  wir  den  alten,  nun  ausgefüllten \r\nKrater,  fanden  die  neuen  Laven  von  zwei  Monaten,  vier- \r\nzehn Tagen,  ja  eine  schwache  von  fünf  Tagen  schon  er- \r\nkaltet. Wir  stiegen  über  sie  an  einem  erst  aufgeworfenen \r\nvulkanischen  Hügel  hinauf,  er  dampfte  aus  allen  Enden. \r\nDer  Rauch  zog  von  uns  weg,  und  ich  wollte  nach  dem \r\nKrater  gehn.  Wir  waren  ohngefähr  fünfzig  Schritte  in  den \r\nDampf  hinein,  als  er  so  stark  wurde,  daß  ich  kaum  meine \r\nSchuhe  sehen  konnte.  Das  Schnupftuch  vorgehalten  half \r\nnichts,  der  Führer  war  mir  auch  verschwunden,  die \r\nTritte  auf  den  ausgeworfenen  Lavabröckchen  unsicher: \r\nich  fand  für  gut,  umzukehren  und  mir  den  gewünschten \r\nAnblick  auf  einen  heitern  Tag  und  verminderten  Rauch \r\nzu  sparen.  Indes  weiß  ich  doch  auch,  wie  schlecht  es \r\nsich  in  solcher  Atmosphäre  Atem  holt. \r\nÜbrigens  war  der  Berg  ganz  still:  weder  Flamme  noch \r\nBrausen  noch  Steinwurf,  wie  er  doch  die  ganze  Zeit  her \r\ntrieb.  Ich  habe  ihn  nun  rekognosziert,  um  ihn  förmlich, \r\nsobald  das  Wetter  gut  werden  will,  zu  belagern. \r\nDie  Laven,  die  ich  fand,  waren  mir  meist  bekannte  Gegen- \r\nstände. Ein  Phänomen  hab  ich  aber  entdeckt,  das  mir \r\nsehr  merkwürdig  schien  und  das  ich  näher  untersuchen, \r\nnach  welchem  ich  mich  bei  Kennern  und  Sammlern  er- \r\nkundigen will.  Es  ist  eine  tropfsteinförmige  Bekleidung \r\neiner  vulkanischen  Esse,  die  ehemals  zugewölbt  war,  jetzt \r\naber  aufgeschlagen  ist  und  aus  dem  alten,  nun  ausge- \r\nfüllten Krater  herausragt.  Dieses  feste,  grauliche,  tropf- \r\nsteinförmige Gestein  scheint  mir  durch  Sublimation  der \r\nallerfeinsten  vulkanischen  Ausdünstungen,  ohne  Mitwir- \r\nkung von  Feuchtigkeit  und  ohne  Schmelzung,  gebildet  wor- \r\nden zu  sein;  es  gibt  zu  weitern  Gedanken  Gelegenheit. \r\nHeute,  den  3.  März,  ist  der  Himmel  bedeckt,  und  ein \r\nScirocco  weht;  zum  Posttage  gutes  Wetter. \r\nSehr  gemischte  Menschen,  schöne  Pferde  und  wunder- \r\nliche Fische  habe  ich  hier  übrigens  schon  genug  gesehn. \r\nVon  der  Lage  der  Stadt  und  ihren  Herrlichkeiten,  die  so \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  201 \r\n\r\noft  beschrieben  und  belobt  sind,  kein  Wort.  Vedi  Napoli \r\ne  poi  muori!  sagen  sie  hier.     Siehe  Neapel  und  stirb! \r\n\r\nDen  j.  März. \r\nDaß  kein  Neapolitaner  von  seiner  Stadt  weichen  will, \r\ndaß  ihre  Dichter  von  der  Glückseligkeit  der  hiesigen  Lage \r\nin  gewaltigen  Hyperbeln  singen,  ist  ihnen  nicht  zu  ver- \r\ndenken ,  und  wenn  auch  noch  ein  paar  Vesuve  in  der \r\nNachbarschaft  stünden.  Man  mag  sich  hier  an  Rom  gar \r\nnicht  zurück  erinnern:  gegen  die  hiesige  freie  Lage  kommt \r\neinem  die  Hauptstadt  der  Welt  im  Tibergrunde  wie  ein \r\naltes  übelplaciertes  Kloster  vor. \r\n\r\nDas  See-  und  Schiffwesen  gewährt  auch  ganz  neue  Zu- \r\nstände. Die  Fregatte  nach  Palermo  ging  mit  reiner, \r\nstarker  Tramontane  gestern  ab.  Diesmal  hat  sie  gewiß \r\nnicht  über  sechsunddreißig  Stunden  auf  der  Fahrt  zuge- \r\nbracht. Mit  welcher  Sehnsucht  sah  ich  den  vollen  Segeln \r\nnach,  als  das  Schiff  zwischen  Capri  und  Kap  Minerva \r\ndurchfuhr  und  endlich  verschwand.  Wenn  man  jemand \r\nGeliebtes  so  fortfahren  sähe,  müßte  man  vor  Sehnsucht \r\nsterben!  Jetzt  weht  der  Scirocco;  wenn  der  Wind  stärker \r\nwird,  werden  die  Wellen  um  den  Molo  lustig  genug  sein. \r\nHeute,  als  an  einem  Freitage,  war  die  große  Spazierfahrt \r\ndes  Adels,  wo  jeder  seine  Equipagen,  besonders  Pferde \r\nproduziert.  Man  kann  unmöglich  etwas  Zierlichers  sehen \r\nals  diese  Geschöpfe  hier;  es  ist  das  erstemal  in  meinem \r\nLeben,  daß  mir  das  Herz  gegen  sie  aufgeht. \r\n\r\nDen  3.  März. \r\nHier  schick  ich  einige  gedrängte  Blätter  als  Nachricht \r\nvon  dem  Einstände,  den  ich  hier  gegeben.  Auch  ein  an \r\nder  Ecke  angeschmauchtes  Kuvert  eures  letzten  Briefes, \r\nzum  Zeugnis,  daß  er  mit  auf  dem  Vesuv  gewesen.  Doch \r\nmuß  ich  euch  nicht,  weder  im  Traume  noch  im  Wachen, \r\nvon  Gefahr  umgeben  erscheinen;  seid  versichert:  da,  wo \r\nich  gehe,  ist  nicht  mehr  Gefahr  als  auf  der  Chaussee \r\nnach  Belvedere.  Die  Erde  ist  überall  des  Herrn !  kann \r\nman  wohl  bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  sagen.  Ich  suche  keine \r\nAbenteuer  aus  Vorwitz  noch   Sonderbarkeit,    aber   weil \r\n\r\n\r\n2  02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nich  meist  klar  bin  und  dem  Gegenstand  bald  seine  Eigen- \r\ntümlichkeit abgewinne,  so  kann  ich  mehr  tun  und  wagen \r\nals  ein  anderer.  Nach  Sizilien  ist's  nichts  weniger  als \r\ngefährlich.  Vor  einigen  Tagen  fuhr  die  Fregatte  nach \r\nPalermo  mit  günstigem  Nordostwind  ab,  sie  ließ  Capri \r\nrechts  und  hat  gewiß  den  Weg  in  sechsunddreißig  Stun- \r\nden zurückgelegt.  Drüben  sieht  es  auch  in  der  Wirklich- \r\nkeit nicht  so  gefährlich  aus,  als  man  es  in  der  Ferne  zu \r\nmachen  beliebt. \r\n\r\nVom  Erdbeben  spürt  man  jetzt  im  untern  Teile  von \r\nItalien  gar  nichts,  im  obern  ward  neulich  Rimini  und \r\nnaheliegende  Orte  beschädigt.  Es  hat  wunderliche  Lau- \r\nnen, man  spricht  hier  davon  wie  von  Wind  und  Wetter \r\nund  in  Thüringen  von  Feuersbrünsten. \r\nMich  freut,  daß  ihr  nun  mit  der  neuen  Bearbeitung  der \r\nIphigenia  euch  befreundet;  noch  lieber  wäre  mir's,  wenn \r\neuch  der  Unterschied  fühlbarer  geworden  wäre.  Ich  weiß, \r\nwas  ich  darangetan  habe,  und  darf  davon  reden,  weil  ich \r\nes  noch  weiter  treiben  könnte.  Wenn  es  eine  Freude  ist, \r\ndas  Gute  zu  genießen,  so  ist  es  eine  größere,  das  Bessere \r\nzu  empfinden,  und  in  der  Kunst  ist  das  Beste  gut  genug. \r\n\r\nDen  5.  März. \r\nDen  zweiten  Fastensonntag  benutzten  wir,  von  Kirche \r\nzu  Kirche  zu  wandern.  Wie  in  Rom  alles  höchst  ernst- \r\nhaft ist,  so  treibt  sich  hier  alles  lustig  und  wohlgemut. \r\nAuch  die  neapolitanische  Malerschule  begreift  man  nur  zu \r\nNeapel.  Hier  sieht  man  mit  Verwunderung  die  ganze \r\nVorderseite  einer  Kirche  von  unten  bis  oben  gemalt,  über \r\nder  Türe  Christus,  der  die  Käufer  und  Verkäufer  zum \r\nTempel  hinaustreibt,  welche  zu  beiden  Seiten,  munter \r\nund  zierlich,  erschreckt  die  Treppe  herunterpurzeln.  In- \r\nnerhalb einer  andern  Kirche  ist  der  Raum  über  dem  Ein- \r\ngang reichhaltig  mit  einem  Freskogemälde  geziert,  die \r\nVertreibung  Heliodors  vorstellend.  Luca  Giordano  mußte \r\nsich  freilich  spuden,  um  solche  Flächen  auszufüllen.  Auch \r\ndie  Kanzel  ist  nicht  immer,  wie  anderwärts,  ein  Katheder \r\nLehrstuhl  für  eine  einzelne  Person,  sondern  eine  Galerie, \r\nauf  welcher  ich  einen  Kapuziner  hin  und  her  schreiten \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  203 \r\n\r\nund  bald  von  dem  einen,  bald  von  dem  andern  Ende \r\ndem  Volk  seine  Sündhaftigkeit  vorhalten  sah.  Was  wäre \r\nda  nicht  alles  zu  erzählen! \r\n\r\nAber  weder  zu  erzählen  noch  zu  beschreiben  ist  die \r\nHerrlichkeit  einer  Vollmondnacht,  wie  wir  sie  genossen, \r\ndurch  die  Straßen  über  die  Plätze  wandelnd,  auf  der \r\nChiaja,  dem  unermeßlichen  Spaziergang,  sodann  am \r\nMeeresufer  hin  und  wider.  Es  übernimmt  einen  wirklich \r\ndas  Gefühl  von  Unendlichkeit  des  Raums.  So  zu  träumen, \r\nist  denn  doch  der  Mühe  wert. \r\n\r\nVon  einem  treulichen  Manne,  den  ich  diese  Tage  kennen \r\ngelernt,  muß  ich  kürzlich  das  Allgemeinste  erwähnen. \r\nEs  ist  Ritter  Filangieri,  bekannt  durch  sein  Werk  über \r\ndie  Gesetzgebung.  Er  gehört  zu  den  ehrwürdigen  jungen \r\nMännern,  welche  das  Glück  der  Menschen  und  eine  löb- \r\nliche Freiheit  derselben  im  Auge  behalten.  An  seinem \r\nBetragen  kann  man  den  Soldaten,  den  Ritter  und  Welt- \r\nmann erkennen;  gemildert  ist  jedoch  dieser  Anstand \r\ndurch  den  Ausdruck  eines  zarten  sittlichen  Gefühls, \r\nwelches,  über  die  ganze  Person  verbreitet,  aus  Wort  und \r\nWesen  gar  anmutig  hervorleuchtet.  Auch  er  ist  seinem \r\nKönige  und  dessen  Königreich  im  Herzen  verbündet, \r\nwenn  er  auch  nicht  alles  billigt,  was  geschieht;  aber  auch \r\ner  ist  gedrückt  durch  die  Furcht  vor  Joseph  dem  Zweiten. \r\nDas  Bild  eines  Despoten,  wenn  es  auch  nur  in  der  Luft \r\nschwebt,  ist  edlen  Menschen  schon  fürchterlich.  Er \r\nsprach  mit  mir  ganz  offen,  was  Neapel  von  jenem  zu \r\nfürchten  habe.  Er  unterhält  sich  gern  über  Montesquieu, \r\nBeccaria,  auch  über  seine  eigenen  Schriften,  alles  in \r\ndemselben  Geiste  des  besten  Wollens  und  einer  herzlichen, \r\njugendlichen  Lust,  das  Gute  zu  wirken.  Er  mag  noch \r\nin  den  Dreißigen  stehen. \r\n\r\nGar  bald  machte  er  mich  mit  einem  alten  Schriftsteller \r\nbekannt,  an  dessen  unergründlicher  Tiefe  sich  diese \r\nneuern  italienischen  Gesetzfreunde  höchlich  erquicken \r\nund  erbauen;  er  heißt  Johann  Baptista  Vico,  sie  ziehen \r\nihn  dem  Montesquieu  vor.  Bei  einem  flüchtigen  Über- \r\nblick des  Buches,  das  sie  mir  als  ein  Heiligtum  mitteilten. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  04  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwollte  mir  scheinen,  hier  seien  sibyllinische  Vorahnungen \r\ndes  Guten  und  Rechten,  das  einst  kommen  soll  oder \r\nsollte,  gegründet  auf  ernste  Betrachtungen  des  Über- \r\nlieferten und  des  Lebens.  Es  ist  gar  schön,  wenn  ein \r\nVolk  solch  einen  Ältervater  besitzt;  den  Deutschen  wird \r\neinst  Hamann  ein  ähnlicher  Kodex  werden. \r\n\r\nDe7i  6.  März. \r\nObgleich  ungern,  doch  aus  treuer  Geselligkeit  begleitete \r\nTischbein  mich  heute  auf  den  Vesuv.  Ihm,  dem  bildenden \r\nKünstler,  der  sich  nur  immer  mit  den  schönsten  Men- \r\nschen- und  Tierfomien  beschäftigt,  ja  das  Ungeformte \r\nselbst,  Felsen  und  Landschaften,  durch  Sinn  und  Ge- \r\nschmack vermenschlicht,  ihm  wird  eine  solche  furchtbare, \r\nungestalte  Aufhäufung,  die  sich  immer  wieder  selbst  ver- \r\nzehrt und  allem  Schönheitsgefühl  den  Krieg  ankündigt, \r\nganz  abscheulich  vorkommen. \r\n\r\nWir  fuhren  auf  zwei  Kaiessen,  weil  wir  uns  als  Selbst- \r\nführer durch  das  Gewühl  der  Stadt  nicht  durchzuwinden \r\ngetrauten.  Der  Fahrende  schreit  unaufhörlich:  Platz,  Platz! \r\ndamit  Esel,  Holz  oder  Kehricht  Tragende,  entgegenrol- \r\nlende Kaiessen,  lastschleppende  oder  freiwandelnde \r\nMenschen,  Kinder  und  Greise  sich  vorsehen,  ausweichen, \r\nungehindert  aber  der  scharfe  Trab  fortgesetzt  werde. \r\nDer  Weg  durch  die  äußersten  Vorstädte  und  Gärten  sollte \r\nschon  auf  etwas  Plutonisches  hindeuten.  Denn  da  es  lange \r\nnicht  geregnet,  waren  von  dickem,  aschgrauen  Staube  die \r\nvon  Natur  immergrünen  Blätter  überdeckt,  alle  Dächer, \r\nGurtgesimse,  und  was  nur  irgend  eine  Fläche  bot,  gleich- \r\nfalls übergraut,  so  daß  nur  der  herrliche  blaue  Himmel \r\nund  die  hereinscheinende  mächtige  Sonne  ein  Zeugnis \r\ngab,  daß  man  unter  den  Lebendigen  wandle. \r\nAm  Fuße  des  steilen  Hanges  empfingen  uns  zwei  Führer, \r\nein  älterer  und  ein  jüngerer,  beides  tüchtige  Leute.  Der \r\nerste  schleppte  mich,  der  zweite  Tischbein  den  Berg  hin- \r\nauf. Sie  schleppten,  sage  ich:  denn  ein  solcher  Führer  um- \r\ngürtet sich  mit  einem  ledernen  Riemen,  in  welchen  der \r\nReisende  greift  und,  hinaufwärts  gezogen,  sich  an  einem \r\nStabe,  auf  seinen  eigenen  Füßen,  desto  leichter  emporhilft. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  205 \r\n\r\nSo  erlangten  wir  die  Fläche,  über  welcher  sich  der  Kegel- \r\nberg erhebt,  gegen  Norden  die  Trümmer  der  Somma. \r\nEin  Blick  westwärts  über  die  Gegend  nahm,  wie  ein  heil- \r\nsames Bad,  alle  Schmerzen  der  Anstrengung  und  alle \r\nMüdigkeit  hinweg,  und  wir  umkreisten  nunmehr  den  immer \r\nqualmenden,  Stein  und  Asche  auswerfenden  Kegelberg. \r\nSolange  der  Raum  gestattete,  in  gehöriger  Entfernung \r\nzu  bleiben,  war  es  ein  großes,  geisterhebendes  Schauspiel. \r\nErst  ein  gewaltsamer  Donner,  der  aus  dem  tiefsten  Schlünde \r\nhervortönte,  sodann  Steine,  größere  und  kleinere,  zu \r\nTausenden  in  die  Luft  geschleudert,  von  Aschenwolken \r\neingehüllt.  Der  größte  Teil  fiel  in  den  Schlund  zurück. \r\nDie  andern  nach  der  Seite  zu  getriebenen  Brocken,  auf \r\ndie  Außenseite  des  Kegels  niederfallend,  machten  ein \r\nwunderbares  (jeräusch:  erst  plumpten  die  schwereren  und \r\nhupften  mit  dumpfem  Getön  an  die  Kegelseite  hinab, \r\ndie  geringeren  klapperten  hinterdrein,  und  zuletzt  rieselte \r\ndie  Asche  nieder.  Dieses  alles  geschah  in  regelmäßigen \r\nPausen,  die  wir  durch  ein  ruhiges  Zählen  sehr  wohl  ab- \r\nmessen konnten. \r\n\r\nZwischen  der  Somma  und  dem  Kegelberge  ward  aber  der \r\nRaum  enge  genug;  schon  fielen  mehrere  Steine  um  uns \r\nher  und  machten  den  Umgang  unerfreulich.  Tischbein \r\nfühlte  sich  nunmehr  auf  dem  Berge  noch  verdrießlicher, \r\nda  dieses  Ungetüm,  nicht  zufrieden,  häßlich  zu  sein,  auch \r\nnoch  gefährlich  werden  wollte. \r\n\r\nWie  aber  durchaus  eine  gegenwärtige  Gefahr  etwas  Reizen- \r\ndes hat  und  den  Widerspruchsgeist  im  Menschen  auf- \r\nfordert, ihr  zu  trotzen,  so  bedachte  ich,  daß  es  möglich \r\nsein  müsse,  in  der  Zwischenzeit  von  zwei  Elruptionen, \r\nden  Kegelberg  hinauf  an  den  Schlund  zu  gelangen  und \r\nauch  in  diesem  Zeitraum  den  Rückweg  zu  gewinnen.  Ich \r\nratschlagte  hierüber  mit  den  Führern,  unter  einem  über- \r\nhängenden Felsen  der  Somma,  wo  wir,  in  Sicherheit  ge- \r\nlagert, uns  an  den  mitgebrachten  Vorräten  erquickten. \r\nDer  jüngere  getraute  sich,  das  Wagestück  mit  mir  zu  be- \r\nstehen: unsere  Hutköpfe  fütterten  wir  mit  leinenen  und \r\nseidenen  Tüchern,  wir  stellten  uns  bereit,  die  Stäbe  in \r\nder  Hand,  ich  seinen  Gürtel  fassend. \r\n\r\n\r\n2o6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nNoch  klapperten  die  kleinen  Steine  um  uns  herum,  noch \r\nrieselte  die  Asche,  als  der  rüstige  Jüngling  mich  schon \r\nüber  das  glühende  Gerolle  hinaufriß.  Hier  standen  wir  an \r\ndem  ungeheuren  Rachen,  dessen  Rauch  eine  leise  Luft \r\nvon  uns  ablenkte,  aber  zugleich  das  Innere  des  Schlundes \r\nverhüllte,  der  ringsum  aus  tausend  Ritzen  dampfte.  Durch \r\neinen  Zwischenraum  des  Qualmes  erblickte  man  hie  und \r\nda  geborstene  Felsenwände.  Der  Anblick  war  weder \r\nunterrichtend  noch  erfreulich;  aber  eben  deswegen,  weil \r\nman  nichts  sah,  verweilte  man,  um  etwas  herauszusehen. \r\nDas  ruhige  Zählen  war  versäumt,  wir  standen  auf  einem \r\nscharfen  Rande  vor  dem  ungeheuren  Abgrund.  Auf  ein- \r\nmal erscholl  der  Donner,  die  furchtbare  Ladung  flog  an \r\nuns  vorbei;  wir  duckten  uns  unwillkürlich,  als  wenn  uns \r\ndas  vor  den  niederstürzenden  Massen  gerettet  hätte;  die \r\nkleineren  Steine  klapperten  schon,  und  wir,  ohne  zu  be- \r\ndenken, daß  wir  abermals  eine  Pause  vor  uns  hatten,  froh, \r\ndie  Gefahr  überstanden  zu  haben,  kamen  mit  der  noch \r\nrieselnden  Asche  am  Fuße  des  Kegels  an.  Hüte  und \r\nSchultern  genugsam  eingeäschert. \r\n\r\nVon  Tischbein  aufs  freundlichste  empfangen,  gescholten \r\nund  erquickt,  konnte  ich  nun  den  älteren  und  neueren \r\nLaven  eine  besondere  Aufmerksamkeit  widmen.  Der  be- \r\ntagte Führer  wußte  genau  die  Jahrgänge  zu  bezeichnen. \r\nÄltere  waren  schon  mit  Asche  bedeckt  und  ausgeglichen, \r\nneuere,  besonders  die  langsam  geflossenen,  boten  einen \r\nseltsamen  Anblick;  denn  indem  sie,  fortschleichend,  die \r\nauf  ihrer  Oberfläche  erstarrten  Massen  eine  Zeitlang  mit \r\nsich  hinschleppen,  so  muß  es  doch  begegnen,  daß  diese \r\nvon  Zeit  zu  Zeit  stocken,  aber,  von  den  Glutströmen  noch \r\nfortbewegt,  übereinander  geschoben,  wunderbar  zackig \r\nerstarrt  verharren,  seltsamer  als  im  ähnlichen  Fall  die \r\nübereinander  getriebenen  Eisschollen.  Unter  diesem  ge- \r\nschmolzenen wüsten  Wesen  fanden  sich  auch  große  Blöcke, \r\nwelche,  angeschlagen,  auf  dem  frischen  Bruch  einer  Ur- \r\ngebirgsart  völlig  ähnlich  sehen.  Die  Führer  behaupteten, \r\nes  seien  alte  Laven  des  tiefsten  Grundes,  welche  der \r\nBerg  manchmal  auswerfe. \r\nAuf  unserer  Rückkehr  nach  Neapel  wurden  mir  kleine \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  207 \r\n\r\nHäuser  merkwürdig,  einstöckig,  sonderbar  gebaut,  ohne \r\nFenster,  die  Zimmer  nur  durch  die  auf  die  Straße  gehende \r\nTüre  erleuchtet.  Von  früher  Tageszeit  bis  in  die  Nacht \r\nsitzen  die  Bewohner  davor,  da  sie  sich  denn  zuletzt  in \r\nihre  Höhlen  zurückziehen. \r\n\r\nDie  auf  eine  etwas  verschiedene  Weise  am  Abend  tumul- \r\ntuierende  Stadt  entlockte  mir  den  Wunsch,  einige  Zeit  hier \r\nverweilen  zu  können,  um  das  bewegliche  Bild  nach  Kräf- \r\nten zu  entwerfen.    Es  wird  mir  nicht  so  wohl  werden. \r\n\r\nMithvoch  den  7.  März. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  hat  mir  diese  Woche  Tischbein  redlich  einen \r\ngroßen  Teil  der  Kunstschätze  von  Neapel  gezeigt  und \r\nausgelegt.  Er,  ein  trefflicher  Tierkenner  und  Zeichner, \r\nmachte  mich  schon  früher  aufmerksam  auf  einen  Pferde - \r\nköpf  von  Erz  im  Palast  Colobrano.  Wir  gingen  heute  da- \r\nhin. Dieser  Kunstrest  steht  grade  der  Torfahrt  gegen- \r\nüber im  Hofe,  in  einer  Nische  über  einem  Brunnen,  und \r\nsetzt  in  Erstaunen;  was  muß  das  Haupt  erst,  mit  den \r\nübrigen  Gliedern  zu  einem  Ganzen  verbunden,  für  Wir- \r\nkung getan  haben!  Das  Pferd  im  ganzen  war  viel  größer \r\nals  die  auf  der  Markuskirche;  auch  läßt  hier  das  Haupt, \r\nnäher  und  einzeln  beschaut,  Charakter  und  Kraft  nur \r\ndesto  deutlicher  erkennen  und  bewundern.  Der  prächtige \r\nStirnknochen,  die  schnaubende  Nase,  die  aufmerkenden \r\nOhren,  die  starre  Mähne!  ein  mächtig  aufgeregtes,  kräf- \r\ntiges Geschöpf. \r\n\r\nWir  kehrten  uns  um,  eine  weibliche  Statue  zu  bemerken, \r\ndie  über  dem  Torwege  in  einer  Nische  stand.  Sie  wird \r\nfür  die  Nachbildung  einer  Tänzerin  schon  von  Winckel- \r\nmann  gehalten,  wie  denn  solche  Künstlerinnen  in  leben- \r\ndiger Bewegung  auf  das  mannigfaltigste  dasjenige  vor- \r\nstellen, was  die  bildenden  Meister  uns  als  erstarrte \r\nNymphen  und  Göttinnen  aufbewahren.  Sie  ist  sehr  leicht \r\nund  schön,  der  Kopf  war  abgebrochen,  ist  aber  gut  wie- \r\nder aufgesetzt,  übrigens  nichts  daran  versehrt,  und  ver- \r\ndiente wohl  einen  bessern  Platz. \r\n\r\n\r\n2o8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nDen  g.  März. \r\nHeute  erhalte  icli  die  liebsten  Briefe  vom  i6.  Februar. \r\nSchreibet  nur  immer  fort.  Ich  habe  meine  Zwischen- \r\nposten wohl  bestellt  und  werde  es  auch  tun,  wenn  ich \r\nweiter  gehen  sollte.  Gar  sonderbar  kommt  es  mir  vor, \r\nin  so  großer  Entfernung  zu  lesen,  daß  die  Freunde  nicht \r\nzusammenkommen;  imd  doch  ist  oft  nichts  natürlicher, \r\nals  daß  man  nicht  zusammen  kommt,  wenn  man  so  nahe \r\nbeisammen  ist. \r\n\r\nDas  Wetter  hat  sich  verdunkelt,  es  ist  im  Wechseln;  das \r\nFrühjahr  tritt  ein,  und  wir  werden  Regentage  haben. \r\nNoch  ist  der  Gipfel  des  Vesuvs  nicht  heiter  geworden, \r\nseit  ich  droben  war.  Diese  letzten  Nächte  sah  man  ihn \r\nmanchmal  flammen,  jetzt  hält  er  wieder  inne;  man  er- \r\nwartet stärkeren  Ausbruch. \r\n\r\nDie  Stürme  dieser  Tage  haben  uns  ein  herrliches  Meer \r\ngezeigt;  da  ließen  sich  die  Wellen  in  ihrer  würdigen  Art \r\nund  Gestalt  studieren:  die  Natur  ist  doch  das  einzige \r\nBuch,  das  auf  allen  Blättern  großen  Gehalt  bietet.  Da- \r\ngegen gibt  mir  das  Theater  gar  keine  Freude  mehr.  Sie \r\nspielen  hier  in  den  Fasten  geistliche  Opern,  die  sich  von \r\nden  weltlichen  in  gar  nirhts  unterscheiden,  als  daß  keine \r\nBallette  zwischen  den  Akten  eingeschaltet  sind;  übrigens \r\naber  so  bunt  als  möglich.  Im  Theater  San  Carlo  führen \r\nsie  auf:  Zerstörung  von  Jerusalem  durch  Nebukadnezar. \r\nMir  ist  es  ein  großer  Guckkasten;  es  scheint,  ich  bin  für \r\nsolche  Dinge  verdorben. \r\n\r\nHeute  waren  wir  mit  dem  Fürsten  von  Waldeck  auf  Capo \r\ndi  Monte,  wo  die  große  Sammlung  von  Gemälden,  Mün- \r\nzen u.  dgl.  sich  befindet,  nicht  angenehm  aufgestellt,  doch \r\nkostbare  Sachen.  Mir  bestimmen  und  bestätigen  sich \r\nnunmehr  so  viele  Traditionsbegrifife.  Was  von  Münzen, \r\nGemmen,  Vasen  einzeln,  wie  die  gestutzten  Zitronen- \r\nbäume, nach  Norden  kommt,  sieht  in  Masse  hier  ganz \r\nanders  aus,  da,  wo  diese  Schätze  einheimisch  sind. \r\nDenn  wo  Werke  der  Kunst  rar  sind,  gibt  auch  die \r\nRarität  ihnen  einen  Wert;  hier  lernt  man  nur  das  Wür- \r\ndige schätzen. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  209 \r\n\r\nSie  bezahlen  jetzt  großes  Geld  für  die  etrurischen  Vasen, \r\nund  gewiß  finden  sich  schöne  und  treffliche  Stücke  dar- \r\nunter. Kein  Reisender,  der  nicht  etwas  davon  besitzen \r\nwollte.  Man  schlägt  sein  Geld  nicht  so  hoch  an  als  zu \r\nHause,  ich  fürchte  selbst  noch  verführt  zu  werden. \r\n\r\nDas  ist  das  Angenehme  auf  Reisen,  daß  auch  das  Ge- \r\nwöhnliche durch  Neuheit  und  Überraschung  das  Ansehen \r\neines  Abenteuers  gewinnt.  Als  ich  von  Capo  di  Monte \r\nzurückkam,  machte  ich  noch  einen  Abendbesuch  bei  Fi- \r\nlangieri,  wo  ich  auf  dem  Kanapee  neben  der  Hausfrau \r\nein  Frauenzimmer  sitzend  fand,  deren  Äußeres  mir  nicht \r\nzu  dem  vertraulichen  Betragen  zu  passen  schien,  dem  sie \r\nsich  ganz  ohne  Zwang  hingab.  In  einem  leichten,  ge- \r\nstreiften, seidenen  Fähnchen,  den  Kopf  wunderlich  auf- \r\ngestutzt, sah  die  kleine  niedliche  Figur  einer  Putzmache- \r\nrin ähnlich,  die,  für  die  Zierde  anderer  sorgend,  ihrem \r\neigenen  Aussehen  wenig  Aufmerksamkeit  schenkt.  Sie \r\nsind  so  gewohnt,  ihre  Arbeit  bezahlt  zu  sehen,  daß  sie \r\nnicht  begreifen,  wie  sie  für  sich  selbst  etwas  gratis  tun \r\nsollen.  Durch  meinen  Eintritt  ließ  sie  sich  in  ihrem  Plau- \r\ndern nicht  stören  und  brachte  eine  Menge  possierliche \r\nGeschichten  vor,  welche  ihr  dieser  Tage  begegnet  oder \r\nvielmehr  durch  ihre  Strudeleien  veranlaßt  worden. \r\nDie  Dame  vom  Hause  wollte  mir  auch  zum  Wort  ver- \r\nhelfen, sprach  über  die  herrliche  Lage  von  Capo  di  Monte \r\nund  die  Schätze  daselbst.  Das  muntere  Weibchen  da- \r\ngegen sprang  in  die  Höhe  und  war,  auf  ihren  Füßen \r\nstehend,  noch  artiger  als  zuvor.  Sie  empfahl  sich,  rannte \r\nnach  der  Türe  und  sagte  mir  im  Vorbeigehen:  Filangieris \r\nkommen  diese  Tage  zu  mir  zu  Tische,  ich  hoffe  Sie  auch \r\nzu  ^ehen!  Fort  war  sie,  ehe  ich  noch  zusagen  konnte. \r\nNun  vernahm  ich,  es  sei  die  Prinzessin  ***,  mit  dem \r\nHause  nah  verwandt.  Filangieris  waren  nicht  reich  und \r\nlebten  in  anständiger  Einschränkung.  So  dacht  ich  mir \r\ndas  Prinzeßchen  auch,  da  ohnehin  solche  hohe  Titel  in \r\nNeapel  nicht  selten  sind.  Ich  merkte  mir  den  Namen, \r\nTag  und  Stunde  und  zweifelte  nicht,  mich  am  rechten \r\nOrte  zu  gehöriger  Zeit  einzufinden. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  14 \r\n\r\n\r\n2 1  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSofintag  den  ii.  März. \r\nDa  mein  Aufenthalt  in  Neapel  nicht  lange  dauern  wird, \r\nso  nehme  ich  gleich  die  entfernteren  Punkte  zuerst;  das \r\nNähere  gibt  sich.  Mit  Tischbein  fuhr  ich  nach  Pompeji, \r\nda  wir  denn  alle  die  herrlichen  Ansichten  links  und  rechts \r\nneben  uns  liegen  sahen,  welche,  durch  so  manche  land- \r\nschaftliche Zeichnung  uns  wohl  bekannt,  nunmehr  in \r\nihrem  zusammenhängenden  Glänze  erschienen.  Pom- \r\npeji setzt  jedermann  wegen  seiner  Enge  und  Kleinheit \r\nin  Verwunderung.  Schmale  Straßen,  obgleich  grade  und \r\nan  der  Seite  mit  Schrittplatten  versehen,  kleine  Häuser \r\nohne  Fenster,  aus  den  Höfen  und  ofthen  Galerien  die \r\nZimmer  nur  durch  die  Türen  erleuchtet.  Selbst  öftent- \r\nliche  Werke,  die  Bank  am  Tor,  der  Tempel,  sodann  auch \r\neine  Villa  in  der  Nähe,  mehr  Modell  und  Puppenschrank \r\nals  Gebäude.  Diese  Zimmer,  Gänge  und  Galerien  aber \r\naufs  heiterste  gemalt,  die  Wandflächen  einförmig,  in  der \r\nMitte  ein  ausführliches  Gemälde,  jetzt  meist  ausgebrochen, \r\nan  Kanten  und  Enden  leichte  und  geschmackvolle  Ara- \r\nbesken, aus  welchen  sich  auch  wohl  niedliche  Kinder- \r\nund  Nymphengestalten  entwickeln,  wenn  an  einer  andern \r\nStelle  aus  mächtigen  Blumengewinden  wilde  und  zahme \r\nTiere  hervordringen.  Und  so  deutet  der  jetzige  ganz \r\nwüste  Zustand  einer  erst  durch  Stein-  und  Aschenregen \r\nbedeckten,  dann  aber  durch  die  Aufgrabenden  geplün- \r\nderten Stadt  auf  eine  Kunst-  und  Bilderlust  eines  ganzen \r\nVolkes,  von  der  jetzo  der  eifrigste  Liebhaber  weder  Be- \r\ngriff noch  Gefühl  noch  Bedürfnis  hat. \r\nBedenkt  man  die  Entfernung  dieses  Orts  vom  Vesuv, \r\nso  kann  die  bedeckende  vulkanische  Masse  weder  durch \r\nein  Schleudern  noch  durch  einen  Windstoß  hierher  ge- \r\ntrieben sein;  man  muß  sich  vielmehr  vorstellen,  daß  diese \r\nSteine  und  Asche  eine  Zeitlang  wolkenartig  in  der  Luft \r\ngeschwebt,  bis  sie  endlich  über  diesem  unglücklichen \r\nOrte  niedergegangen. \r\n\r\nWenn  man  sich  nun  dieses  Ereignis  noch  mehr  versinn- \r\nlichen will,  so  denke  man  allenfalls  ein  eingeschneites \r\nBergdorf.    Die  Räume  zwischen  den  Gebäuden,  ja  die \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  211 \r\n\r\nzerdrückten  Gebäude  selbst  wurden  ausgefüllt,  allein \r\nMauerwerk  mochte  hier  und  da  noch  herausstehen,  als \r\nfrüher  oder  später  der  Hügel  zu  Weinbergen  und  Gärten \r\nbenutzt  wurde.  So  hat  nun  gewiß  mancher  Eigentümer, \r\nauf  seinem  Anteil  niedergrabend,  eine  bedeutende  Vor- \r\nlese gehalten.  Mehrere  Zimmer  fand  man  leer  und  in \r\nder  Ecke  des  einen  einen  Haufen  Asche,  der  mancherlei \r\nkleines  Hausgeräte  und  Kimstarbeiten  versteckte. \r\nDen  wunderlichen,  halb  unangenehmen  Eindruck  dieser \r\nmumisierten  Stadt  wuschen  wir  wieder  aus  den  Gemütern, \r\nals  wir  in  der  Laube,  zunächst  des  Meeres,  in  einem  ge- \r\nringen Gasthof  sitzend,  ein  frugales  Mahl  verzehrten  und \r\nuns  an  der  Himmelsbläue,  an  des  Meeres  Glanz  und \r\nLicht  ergötzten,  in  Hoffnung,  wenn  dieses  Fleckchen  mit \r\nWeinlaub  bedeckt  sein  würde,  uns  hier  wiederzusehen \r\nund  uns  zusammen  zu  ergötzen. \r\n\r\nNäher  an  der  Stadt  fielen  mir  die  kleinen  Häuser  wieder \r\nauf,  die  als  vollkommene  Nachbildungen  der  pompejani- \r\nschen  dastehen.  Wir  erbaten  uns  die  Erlaubnis,  in  eins \r\nhineinzutreten,  und  fanden  es  sehr  reinlich  eingerichtet. \r\nNett  geflochtene  Rohrstühle,  eine  Kommode  ganz  ver- \r\ngoldet, mit  bunten  Blumen  staffiert  und  lackiert,  so  daß \r\nnach  so  vielen  Jahrhunderten,  nach  unzähligen  Verände- \r\nrungen diese  Gegend  ihren  Bewohnern  ähnliche  Lebens- \r\nart und  Sitte,  Neigungen  und  Liebhabereien  einflößt. \r\n\r\nMontag  den  12.  März. \r\nHeute  schlich  ich  beobachtend,  meiner  Weise  nach,  durch \r\ndie  Stadt  und  notierte  mir  viele  Punkte  zu  dereinstiger \r\nSchilderung  derselben,  davon  ich  leider  gegenwärtig  nichts \r\nmitteilen  kann.  Alles  deutet  dahin,  daß  ein  glückliches, \r\ndie  ersten  Bedürfnisse  reichlich  anbietendes  Land  auch \r\nMenschen  von  glücklichem  Naturell  erzeugt,  die  ohne \r\nKümmernis  erwarten  können,  der  morgende  Tag  werde \r\nbringen,  was  der  heutige  gebracht,  und  deshalb  sorgenlos \r\ndahin  leben.  Augenblickliche  Befriedigung,  mäßiger  Ge- \r\nnuß, vorübergehender  Leiden  heiteres  Dulden! — Von  dem \r\nletzteren  ein  artiges  Beispiel. \r\n\r\n\r\n2 1  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nDer  Morgen  war  kalt  und  feuchtlich:  es  hatte  wenig  ge- \r\nregnet. Ich  gelangte  auf  einen  Platz,  wo  die  gi'oßen \r\nQuadern  des  Pflasters  reinlich  gekehrt  erschienen.  Zu \r\nmeiner  großen  Verwunderung  sah  ich  auf  diesem  völlig \r\nebenen  gleichen  Boden  eine  Anzahl  zerlumpter  Knaben \r\nim  Kreise  kauzend,  die  Hände  gegen  den  Boden  gewen- \r\ndet, als  wenn  sie  sich  wärmten.  Erst  hielt  ich's  für  eine \r\nPosse;  als  ich  aber  ihre  Mienen  völlig  ernsthaft  und  be- \r\nruhigt sah,  wie  bei  einem  befriedigten  Bedürfnis,  so  strengte \r\nich  meinen  Scharfsinn  möglichst  an,  er  wollte  mich  aber \r\nnicht  begünstigen.  Ich  mußte  daher  fragen,  was  denn \r\ndiese  Aftchen  zu  der  sonderbaren  Positur  verleite  und  sie \r\nin  diesen  regelmäßigen  Kreis  versammele. \r\nHierauf  erfuhr  ich,  daß  ein  anwohnender  Schmied  auf \r\ndieser  Stelle  eine  Radschiene  heiß  gemacht,  welches  auf \r\nfolgende  Weise  geschieht.  Der  eiserne  Reif  wird  auf  den \r\nBoden  gelegt  und  auf  ihn  im  Kreise  so  viel  Eichenspäne \r\ngehäuft,  als  man  nötig  hält,  ihn  bis  auf  den  erforderlichen \r\nGrad  zu  erweichen.  Das  entzündete  Holz  brennt  ab,  die \r\nSchiene  wird  ums  Rad  gelegt  und  die  Asche  sorgfältig \r\nweggekehrt.  Die  dem  Pilaster  mitgeteilte  Wärme  be- \r\nnutzen sogleich  die  kleinen  Huronen  und  rühren  sich \r\nnicht  eher  von  der  Stelle,  als  bis  sie  den  letzten  warmen \r\nHauch  ausgesogen  haben.  Beispiele  solcher  Genügsam- \r\nkeit und  aufmerksamen  Benutzens  dessen,  was  sonst  ver- \r\nloren ginge,  gibt  es  hier  unzählige.  Ich  finde  in  diesem \r\nVolk  die  lebhafteste  und  geistreichste  Industrie,  nicht  um \r\nreich  zu  werden,  sondern  um  sorgenfrei  zu  leben. \r\n\r\nAbends. \r\nDamit  ich  ja  zur  bestimmten  Zeit  heute  bei  dem  wun- \r\nderlichen Prinzeßchen  wäre  und  das  Haus  nicht  verfehlte, \r\nberief  ich  einen  Lohnbedienten.  Er  brachte  mich  vor  das \r\nHoftor  eines  großen  Palastes,  und  da  ich  ihr  keine  so \r\nprächtige  Wohnung  zutraute,  buchstabierte  ich  ihm  noch \r\neinmal  aufs  deutlichste  den  Namen;  er  versicherte,  daß \r\nich  recht  sei.  Nun  fand  ich  einen  geräumigen  Hof,  ein- \r\nsam und  still,  reinlich  und  leer,  von  Haupt-  und  Seiten- \r\ngebäuden umgeben.  Bauart  die  bekannte  heitere  neapo- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  213 \r\n\r\nlitanische,  so  auch  die  Färbung.  Gegen  mir  über  ein \r\ngroßes  Portal  und  eine  breite,  gelinde  Treppe.  An  bei- \r\nden Seiten  derselben  hinaufwärts,  in  kostbarer  Livree, \r\nBedienten  gereiht,  die  sich,  wie  ich  an  ihnen  vorbeistieg, \r\naufs  tiefste  bückten.  Ich  schien  mir  der  Sultan  in  Wie- \r\nlands Feenmärchen  und  faßte  mir  nach  dessen  Beispiel \r\nein  Herz.  Nun  empfingen  mich  die  höheren  Hausbedien- \r\nten, bis  endlich  der  anständigste  die  Türe  eines  großen \r\nSaals  eröffnete,  da  sich  denn  ein  Raum  vor  mir  auftat, \r\nden  ich  ebenso  heiter,  aber  auch  so  menschenleer  fand \r\nals  das  übrige.  Beim  Auf-  und  Abgehen  erblickte  ich  in \r\neiner  Seitengalerie,  etwa  für  vierzig  Personen,  prächtig, \r\ndem  Ganzen  gemäß,  eine  Tafel  bereitet.  Ein  Weltgeist- \r\nlicher trat  herein;  ohne  mich  zu  fragen,  wer  ich  sei,  noch \r\nwoher  ich  komme,  nahm  er  meine  Gegenwart  als  bekannt \r\nan  und  sprach  von  den  allgemeinsten  Dingen. \r\nEin  Paar  Flügeltüren  taten  sich  auf,  hinter  einem  ält- \r\nlichen Herrn,  der  hereintrat,  gleich  wieder  verschlossen. \r\nDer  Geistliche  ging  auf  ihn  los,  ich  auch;  wir  begrüßten \r\nihn  mit  wenigen  höflichen  Worten,  die  er  mit  bellenden, \r\nstotternden  Tönen  erwiderte,  so  daß  ich  mir  keine  Silbe \r\ndes  hottentottischen  Dialekts  enträtseln  konnte.  Als  er \r\nsich  ans  Kamin  gestellt,  zog  sich  der  Geistliche  zurück \r\nund  ich  mit  ihm.  Ein  stattlicher  Benediktiner  trat  herein, \r\nbegleitet  von  einem  jüngeren  Gefährten;  auch  er  begrüßte \r\nden  Wirt,  auch  er  wurde  angebellt,  worauf  er  sich  denn \r\nzu  uns  ans  Fenster  zurückzog.  Die  Ordensgeistlichen, \r\nbesonders  die  eleganter  gekleideten,  haben  in  der  Gesell- \r\nschaft die  größten  Vorzüge,  ihre  Kleidung  deutet  auf \r\nDemut  und  Entsagung,  indem  sie  ihnen  zugleich  ent- \r\nschiedene Würde  verleiht.  In  ihrem  Betragen  können  sie, \r\nohne  sich  wegzuwerfen,  unterwürfig  erscheinen,  und  dann, \r\nwenn  sie  wieder  strack  auf  ihren  Hüften  stehen,  kleidet \r\nsie  eine  gewisse  Selbstgefälligkeit  sogar  wohl,  welche \r\nman  allen  übrigen  Ständen  nicht  zugute  gehen  ließe.  So \r\nwar  dieser  Mann.  Ich  fragte  nach  Monte  Cassino,  er  lud \r\nmich  dahin  und  versprach  mir  die  beste  Aufnahme,  In- \r\ndessen hatte  sich  der  Saal  bevölkert:  Offiziere,  Hofleute^ \r\nWeltgeistliche,  ja  sogar  einige  Kapuziner  waren  gegen- \r\n\r\n\r\n2 1 4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwärtig.  Vergebens  suchte  ich  nach  einer  Dame,  und  daran \r\nsollte  es  denn  auch  nicht  fehlen.  Abermals  ein  Paar \r\nFlügeltüren  taten  sich  auf  und  schlössen  sich.  Eine  alte \r\nDame  war  hereingetreten,  wohl  noch  älter  als  der  Herr, \r\nund  nun  gab  mir  die  Gegenwart  der  Hausfrau  die  völlige \r\nVersicherung,  daß  ich  in  einem  fremden  Palast,  unbe- \r\nkannt völlig  den  Bewohnern  sei.  Schon  wurden  die  Spei- \r\nsen aufgetragen,  und  ich  hielt  mich  in  der  Nähe  der \r\ngeistlichen  Herrn,  um  mit  ihnen  in  das  Paradies  des \r\nTafelzimmers  zu  schlüpfen,  als  auf  einmal  Filangieri  mit \r\nseiner  Gemahlin  hereintrat,  sich  entschuldigend,  daß  er \r\nverspätet  habe.  Kurz  darauf  sprang  Prinzeßchen  auch \r\nin  den  Saal,  fuhr  unter  Knicksen,  Beugungen,  Kopfnicken \r\nan  allen  vorbei  auf  mich  los.  Es  ist  recht  schön,  daß  Sie \r\nWort  halten!  rief  sie.  Setzen  Sie  sich  bei  Tafel  zu  mir, \r\nSie  sollen  die  besten  Bissen  haben.  Warten  Sie  nur!  ich \r\nmuß  mir  erst  den  rechten  Platz  aussuchen,  dann  setzen \r\nSie  sich  gleich  an  mich. — So  aufgefordert,  folgte  ich  den \r\nverschiedenen  Winkelzügen,  die  sie  machte,  und  wir  ge- \r\nlangten endlich  zum  Sitze,  die  Benediktiner  gerade  gegen \r\nuns  über,  Filangieri  an  meiner  andern  Seite. — Das  Essen \r\nist  durchaus  gut,  sagte  sie:  alles  Fastenspeisen,  aber  aus- \r\ngesucht, das  Beste  will  ich  Ihnen  andeuten.  Jetzt  muß \r\nich  aber  die  Pfaffen  scheren.  Die  Kerls  kann  ich  nicht \r\nausstehen;  sie  hucken  unserm  Hause  tagtäglich  etwas  ab. \r\nWas  wir  haben,  sollten  wir  selbst  mit  Freunden  verzeh- \r\nren!-— Die  Suppe  war  herumgegeben,  der  Benediktiner \r\naß  mit  Anstand. — Bitte,  sich  nicht  zu  genieren,  Hoch- \r\nwürden! rief  sie  aus.  Ist  etwa  der  Löffel  zu  klein?  Ich \r\nwill  einen  größern  holen  lassen,  die  Herrn  sind  ein  tüch- \r\ntiges Maulvoll  gewohnt. — Der  Pater  versetzte,  es  sei  in \r\nihrem  fürstlichen  Hause  alles  so  vortrefflich  eingerichtet, \r\ndaß  ganz  andere  Gäste  als  er  eine  vollkommenste  Zu- \r\nfriedenheit empfinden  würden. \r\n\r\nVon  den  Pastetchen  nahm  sich  der  Pater  nur  eins;  sie \r\nrief  ihm  zu,  er  möchte  doch  ein  halb  Dutzend  nehmen: \r\nBlätterteig,  wisse  er  ja,  verdaue  sich  leicht  genug.  Der \r\nverständige  Mann  nahm  noch  ein  Pastetchen,  für  die \r\ngnädige  Attention  dankend,  als  habe  er  den  lästerlichen \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  215 \r\n\r\nScherz  nicht  vernommen.  Und  so  mußte  ihr  auch  bei \r\neinem  derbem  Backwerk  Gelegenheit  werden,  ihre  Bos- \r\nheit auszulassen:  denn  als  der  Pater  ein  Stück  anstach \r\nund  es  auf  seinen  Teller  zog,  rollte  ein  zweites  nach. — \r\nEin  drittes,  rief  sie,  Herr  Pater!  Sie  scheinen  einen  guten \r\nGrund  legen  zu  wollen! — Wenn  so  vortreffliche  Mate- \r\nrialien gegeben  sind,  hat  der  Baumeister  leicht  arbeiten! \r\nversetzte  der  Pater. — Und  so  ging  es  immer  fort,  ohne \r\ndaß  sie  eine  andere  Pause  gemacht  hätte,  als  mir  ge- \r\nwissenhaft die  besten  Bissen  zuzuteilen. \r\nIch  sprach  indessen  mit  meinem  Nachbar  von  den  ern- \r\nstesten Dingen.  Überhaupt  habe  ich  Filangieri  nie  ein \r\ngleichgültiges  Wort  reden  hören.  Er  gleicht  darin,  wie \r\nin  manchem  andern,  unserm  Freunde  Georg  Schlosser, \r\nnur  daß  er,  als  Neapolitaner  und  Weltmann,  eine  weichere \r\nNatur  und  einen  bequemern  Umgang  hat. \r\nDiese  ganze  Zeit  war  den  geistlichen  Herrn  von  dem \r\nMutwillen  meiner  Nachbarin  keine  Ruhe  gegönnt,  be- \r\nsonders gaben  ihr  die  zur  Fastenzeit  in  Fleischgestalt \r\nverwandelten  Fische  unerschöpflichen  Anlaß,  gott-  und \r\nsittenlose  Bemerkungen  anzubringen,  besonders  aber  auch \r\ndie  Fleischeslust  hervorzuheben  und  zu  billigen,  daß  man \r\nsich  wenigstens  an  der  Form  ergötze,  wenn  auch  das \r\nWesen  verboten  sei. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  mir  noch  mehr  solcher  Scherze  gemerkt,  die  ich \r\njedoch  mitzuteilen  nicht  Mut  habe.  Dergleichen  mag  sich \r\nim  Leben  und  aus  einem  schönen  Munde  noch  ganz  er- \r\nträglich ausnehmen,  schwarz  auf  weiß  dagegen  wollen \r\nsie  mir  selbst  nicht  mehr  gefallen.  Und  dann  hat  freche \r\nVerwegenheit  das  Eigene,  daß  sie  in  der  Gegenwart  er- \r\nfreut, weil  sie  in  Erstaunen  setzt;  erzählt  aber  erscheint \r\nsie  uns  beleidigend  und  widerlich. \r\n\r\nDas  Dessert  war  aufgetragen,  und  ich  fürchtete,  nun  gehe \r\nes  immer  so  fort;  unerwartet  aber  wandte  sich  meine \r\nNachbarin  ganz  beruhigt  zu  mir  und  sagte:  Den  Syra- \r\nkuser  sollen  die  Pfaffen  in  Ruhe  verschlucken;  es  gelingt \r\nmir  doch  nicht,  einen  zu  Tode  zu  ärgern,  nicht  einmal, \r\ndaß  ich  ihnen  den  Appetit  verderben  könnte.  Nun  lassen \r\nSie  uns  ein  vernünftiges  Wort  reden!    Denn  was  war  das \r\n\r\n\r\n2 1 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwieder  für  ein  Gespräch  mit  Filangieri!  Der  gute  Mann! \r\ner  macht  sich  viel  zu  schaffen.  Schon  oft  habe  ich  ihm \r\ngesagt:  Wenn  ihr  neue  Gesetze  macht,  so  müssen  wir \r\nuns  wieder  neue  Mühe  geben,  um  auszusinnen,  wie  wir \r\nauch  die  zunächst  übertreten  können;  bei  den  alten  haben \r\nwir  es  schon  weg.  Sehen  Sie  nur  einmal,  wie  schön \r\nNeapel  ist;  die  Menschen  leben  seit  so  vielen  Jahren \r\nsorglos  und  vergnügt,  und  wenn  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  einmal \r\neiner  gehängt  wird,  so  geht  alles  übrige  seinen  herrlichen \r\nGang. \r\n\r\nSie  tat  mir  hierauf  den  Vorschlag,  ich  solle  nach  Sorrent \r\ngehen,  wo  sie  ein  großes  Gut  habe;  ihr  Haushofmeister \r\nwerde  mich  mit  den  besten  Fischen  und  dem  köstlichsten \r\nMilchkalblleisch  (mungana)  herausfüttern.  Die  Bergluft \r\nund  die  himmlische  Aussicht  sollten  mich  von  aller  Phi- \r\nlosophie kurieren;  dann  wollte  sie  selbst  kommen,  und \r\nvon  den  sämtlichen  Runzeln,  die  ich  ohnehin  zu  früh \r\neinreißen  lasse,  solle  keine  Spur  übrigbleiben;  wir  woll- \r\nten zusammen  ein  recht  lustiges  Leben  führen. \r\n\r\nDen  /  ?.  März. \r\nAuch  heute  schreib  ich  einige  Worte,  damit  ein  Brief \r\nden  andern  treibe.  Es  geht  mir  gut,  doch  seh  ich  weni- \r\nger, als  ich  sollte.  Der  Ort  inspiriert  Nachlässigkeit  und \r\ngemächlich  Leben,  indessen  wird  mir  das  Bild  der  Stadt \r\nnach  und  nach  runder. \r\n\r\nSonntag  waren  wir  in  Pompeji.- — Es  ist  viel  Unheil  in \r\nder  Welt  geschehen,  aber  wenig,  das  den  Nachkommen \r\nso  viel  Freude  gemacht  hätte.  Ich  weiß  nicht  leicht  et- \r\nwas Interessanteres.  Die  Häuser  sind  klein  und  eng,  aber \r\nalle  inwendig  aufs  zierlichste  gemalt.  Das  Stadttor  merk- \r\nwürdig, mit  den  Gräbern  gleich  daran.  Das  Grab  einer \r\nPriesterin  als  Bank  im  Halbzirkel,  mit  steinerner  Lehne, \r\ndaran  die  Inschrift  mit  großen  Buchstaben  eingegraben. \r\nÜber  die  Lehne  hinaus  sieht  man  das  Meer  und  die \r\nuntergehende  Sonne.  Ein  herrlicher  Platz,  des  schönen \r\nGedankens  wert. \r\n\r\nWir  fanden  gute  muntere  neapolitanische  Gesellschaft \r\ndaselbst.     Die   Menschen   sind   durchaus   natürlich   und \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  217 \r\n\r\nleichtgesinnt.  Wir  aßen  zu  Torre  dell'  Annunziata,  zu- \r\nnächst des  Meeres  tafelnd.  Der  Tag  war  höchst  schön, \r\ndie  Aussicht  nach  Castell  a  Mare  und  Sorrent  nah  und \r\nköstlich.  Die  Gesellschaft  fühlte  sich  so  recht  an  ihrem \r\nWohnplatz;  einige  meinten,  es  müsse  ohne  den  Anblick \r\ndes  Meers  doch  gar  nicht  zu  leben  sein.  Mir  ist  schon \r\ngenug,  daß  ich  das  Bild  in  der  Seele  habe,  und  mag  nun \r\nwohl  gelegentlich  wieder  in  das  Bergland  zurückkehren. \r\nGlücklicherweise  ist  ein  sehr  treuer  Landschaftsmaler \r\nhier,  der  das  Gefühl  der  freien  und  reichen  Umgebung \r\nseinen  Blättern  mitteilt.  Er  hat  schon  einiges  für  mich \r\ngearbeitet. \r\n\r\nDie  vesuvianischen  Produkte  hab  ich  auch  nun  gut  stu- \r\ndiert; es  wird  doch  alles  anders,  wenn  man  es  in  Ver- \r\nbindung sieht.  Eigentlich  sollt  ich  den  Rest  meines \r\nLebens  auf  Beobachtung  wenden;  ich  würde  manches \r\nauffinden,  was  die  menschlichen  Kenntnisse  vermehren \r\ndürfte.  Herdern  bitte  zu  melden,  daß  meine  botanischen \r\nAufklärungen  weiter  und  weiter  gehen;  es  ist  immer  das- \r\nselbe Prinzip,  aber  es  gehörte  ein  Leben  dazu,  um  es \r\ndurchzuführen.  Vielleicht  bin  ich  noch  imstande,  die \r\nHauptlinien  zu  ziehen. \r\n\r\nNun  freu  ich  mich  auf  das  Museum  von  Portici.  Man \r\nsieht  es  sonst  zuerst,  wir  werden  es  zuletzt  sehen.  Noch \r\nweiß  ich  nicht,  wie  es  weiter  mit  mir  werden  wird:  alles \r\nwill  mich  auf  Ostern  nach  Rom  zurück  haben.  Ich  will \r\nes  ganz  gehen  lassen.  Angelica  hat  aus  meiner  Iphigenie \r\nein  Bild  zu  malen  unternommen;  der  Gedanke  ist  sehr \r\nglücklich,  und  sie  wird  ihn  trefflich  ausführen.  Den  Mo- \r\nment, da  sich  Orest  in  der  Nähe  der  Schwester  und  des \r\nFreundes  wiederfindet.  Das,  was  die  drei  Personen  hin- \r\ntereinander sprechen,  hat  sie  in  eine  gleichzeitige  Gruppe \r\ngebracht  und  jene  Worte  in  Gebärden  verwandelt.  Man \r\nsieht  auch  hieran,  wie  zart  sie  fühlt  und  wie  sie  sich  zu- \r\nzueignen weiß,  was  in  ihr  Fach  gehört.  Und  es  ist  wirk- \r\nlich die  Achse  des  Stücks. \r\n\r\nLebt  wohl  und  liebt  mich!  Hier  sind  mir  die  Menschen \r\nalle  gut,  wenn  sie  auch  nichts  mit  mir  anzufangen  wissen; \r\nTischbein  dagegen  befriedigt  sie  besser;    er  malt  ihnen \r\n\r\n\r\n2 1 8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nabends  gleich  einige  Köpfe  in  Lebensgröße  vor,  wobei \r\nund  worüber  sie  sich  wie  Neuseeländer  bei  Erblickung \r\neines  Kriegsschiftes  gebärden.  Hievon  sogleich  die \r\nlustige  Geschichte: \r\n\r\nTischbein  hat  nämlich  die  große  Gabe,  Götter-  und  Hel- \r\ndengestalten, in  Lebensgröße  und  drüber,  mit  der  Feder \r\nzu  umreißen.  Kr  schraffiert  wenig  hinein  und  legt  mit \r\neinem  breiten  Pinsel  den  Schatten  tüchtig  an,  so  daß  der \r\nKopf  rund  und  erhaben  dasteht.  Die  Beiwohnenden \r\nschauten  mit  Verwunderung,  wie  das  so  leicht  ablief, \r\nund  freuten  sich  recht  herzlich  darüber.  Nun  kam  es \r\nihnen  in  die  Finger,  auch  so  malen  zu  wollen;  sie  faßten \r\ndie  Pinsel  und — malten  sich  Barte  wechselsweise  und \r\nbesudelten  sich  die  Gesichter.  Ist  darin  nicht  etwas  Ur- \r\nsprüngliches der  Menschengattung:  Und  es  war  eine \r\ngebildete  Gesellschaft  in  dem  Hause  eines  Mannes,  der \r\nselbst  recht  wacker  zeichnet  und  malt.  Man  macht  sich \r\nvon  diesem  Geschlecht  keine  Begriffe,  wenn  man  sie  nicht \r\ngesehen  hat. \r\n\r\nCaserta,  Mittwoch  den  14.  März. \r\nBei  Hackert  in  seiner  höchst  behaglichen  Wohnung,  die \r\nihm  in  dem  alten  Schlosse  gegönnt  ist.  Das  neue  freilich \r\nein  ungeheurer  Palast,  escurialartig,  ins  Viereck  gebaut, \r\nmit  mehrern  Höfen,  königlich  genug.  Die  Lage  außer- \r\nordentlich schön,  auf  der  fruchtbarsten  P^bene  von  der \r\nWelt;  und  doch  erstrecken  sich  die  Gartenanlagen  bis \r\nans  Gebirge.  Da  führt  nun  ein  Aquädukt  einen  ganzen \r\nStrom  heran,  um  Schloß  und  Gegend  zu  tränken,  und \r\ndie  ganze  Wassermasse  kann,  auf  künstlich  angelegte  Fel- \r\nsen geworfen,  zur  herrlichsten  Kaskade  gebildet  werden. \r\nDie  Gartenanlagen  sind  schön  und  gehören  recht  in  eine \r\nGegend,  welche  ganz  Garten  ist. \r\n\r\nDas  Schloß,  wahrhaft  königlich,  schien  mir  nicht  genug \r\nbelebt,  und  unsereinem  können  die  Ungeheuern  leeren \r\nRäume  nicht  behaglich  vorkommen.  Der  König  mag  ein \r\nähnliches  Gefühl  haben;  denn  es  ist  im  Gebirge  für  eine \r\nAnlage  gesorgt,  die,  enger  an  den  Menschen  sich  an- \r\nschließend, zur  Jagd-  und  Lebenslust  geeignet  ist. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  219 \r\n\r\nCaserta,  Donnerstag  den  75.  März. \r\nHackert  wohnt  im  alten  Schlosse  gar  behaglich,  es  ist \r\nräumlich  genug  für  ihn  und  Gäste.  Immerfort  beschäftigt \r\nmit  Zeichnen  oder  Malen,  bleibt  er  doch  gesellig  und \r\nweiß  die  Menschen  an  sich  zu  ziehen,  indem  er  einen \r\njeden  zu  seinem  Schüler  macht.  Auch  mich  hat  er  ganz \r\ngewonnen,  indem  er  mit  meiner  Schwäche  Geduld  hat, \r\nvor  allen  Dingen  auf  Bestimmtheit  der  Zeichnung,  so- \r\ndann auf  Sicherheit  und  Klarheit  der  Haltung  dringt. \r\nDrei  Tinten  stehen,  wenn  er  tuscht,  immer  bereit,  und \r\nindem  er  von  hinten  hervorarbeitet  und  eine  nach  der \r\nandern  braucht,  so  entsteht  ein  Bild,  man  weiß  nicht, \r\nwoher  es  kommt.  Wenn  es  nur  so  leicht  auszuführen \r\nwäre,  als  es  aussieht.  Er  sagte  zu  mir  mit  seiner  ge- \r\nwöhnlichen bestimmten  Aufrichtigkeit:  Sie  haben  Anlage, \r\naber  Sie  können  nichts  machen.  Bleiben  Sie  achtzehn \r\nMonat  bei  mir,  so  sollen  Sie  etwas  hervorbringen,  was \r\nIhnen  und  andern  Freude  macht. — Ist  das  nicht  ein \r\nText,  über  den  man  allen  Dilettanten  eine  ewige  Pre- \r\ndigt halten  sollte?  Was  sie  mir  fruchtet,  wollen  wir  er- \r\nleben. \r\n\r\nVon  dem  besondern  Vertrauen,  womit  ihn  die  Königin \r\nbeehrt,  zeugt  nicht  allein,  daß  er  den  Prinzessinnen  prak- \r\ntischen Unterricht  gibt,  sondern  vorzüglich,  daß  er  über \r\nKunst,  und  was  daran  grenzt,  abends  öfters  zu  belehren- \r\nder Unterhaltung  gerufen  wird.  Er  legt  dabei  Sulzers \r\nWörterbuch  zum  Grunde,  woraus  er,  nach  Belieben  und \r\nÜberzeugung,  einen  oder  den  andern  Artikel  wählt. \r\nIch  mußte  das  billigen  und  dabei  über  mich  selbst  lächeln. \r\nWelch  ein  Unterschied  ist  nicht  zwischen  einem  Men- \r\nschen, der  sich  von  innen  aus  auferbauen,  und  einem, \r\nder  auf  die  Welt  wirken  und  sie  zum  Hausgebrauch  be- \r\nlehren will!  Sulzers  Theorie  war  mir,  wegen  ihrer  fal- \r\nschen Grundmaxime,  immer  verhaßt,  und  nun  sah  ich, \r\ndaß  dieses  Werk  noch  viel  mehr  enthielt,  als  die  Leute \r\nbrauchen.  Die  vielen  Kenntnisse,  die  hier  mitgeteilt \r\nwerden,  die  Denkart,  in  welcher  ein  so  wackrer  Mann \r\nals  Sulzer  sich  beruhigte,  sollten  die  nicht  für  Weltleute \r\nhinreichend  sein? \r\n\r\n\r\n2  20  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nMehrere  vergnügte  und  bedeutende  Stunden  brachten \r\nwir  bei  dem  Restaurator  Andres  zu,  welcher,  von  Rom \r\nberufen,  auch  hier  in  dem  alten  Schlosse  wohnt  und  seine \r\nArbeiten,  für  die  sich  der  König  interessiert,  emsig  fort- \r\nsetzt. Von  seiner  Gewandtheit,  alte  Bilder  wiederher- \r\nzustellen, darf  ich  zu  erzählen  nicht  anfangen,  weil  man \r\nzugleich  die  schwere  Aufgabe  und  die  glückliche  Lösung, \r\nwomit  sich  diese  eigene  Handwerkskunst  beschäftigt,  ent- \r\nwickeln müßte. \r\n\r\nCaserta,  den  i6.  März. \r\nDie  Heben  Briefe  vom  19.  Februar  kommen  heute  mir \r\nzur  Hand,  und  gleich  soll  ein  Wort  dagegen  abgehen. \r\nWie  gerne  mag  ich,  an  die  Freunde  denkend,  zur  Be- \r\nsinnung kommen. \r\n\r\nNeapel  ist  ein  Paradies;  jedermann  lebt  in  einer  Art  von \r\ntrunkner  Selbstvergessenheit.  Mir  geht  es  ebenso;  ich \r\nerkenne  mich  kaum,  ich  scheine  mir  ein  ganz  anderer \r\nMensch.  Gestern  dacht  ich:  Entweder  du  warst  sonst \r\ntoll,  oder  du  bist  es  jetzt. \r\n\r\nDie  Reste  des  alten  Capua,  und  was  sich  daran  knüpft, \r\nhab  ich  nun  von  hier  aus  auch  besucht. \r\nIn  dieser  Gegend  lernt  man  erst  verstehen,  was  Vege- \r\ntation ist  und  warum  man  den  Acker  baut.  Der  Lein  ist \r\nschon  nah  am  Blühen  und  der  Weizen  anderthalb  Span- \r\nnen hoch.  Um  Caserta  das  Land  völlig  eben,  die  Äcker \r\nso  gleich  und  klar  gearbeitet  wie  Gartenbeete.  Alles  mit \r\nPappeln  besetzt,  an  denen  sich  die  Rebe  hinaufschlingt, \r\nund  ungeachtet  solcher  Beschattung  trägt  der  I>oden  noch \r\ndie  vollkommenste  Frucht.  Wenn  nun  erst  das  Frühjahr \r\nmit  Gewalt  eintritt!  Bisherhaben  wir  bei  schöner  Sonne \r\nsehr  kalte  Winde  gehabt;  das  macht  der  Schnee  in  den \r\nBergen. \r\n\r\nIn  vierzehn  Tagen  muß  sich's  entscheiden,  ob  ich  nach \r\nSizilien  gehe.  Noch  nie  bin  ich  so  sonderbar  in  einem \r\nEntschluß  hin  und  her  gebogen  worden.  Heute  kommt \r\netwas,  das  mir  die  Reise  anrät,  morgen  ein  Umstand, \r\nder  sie  abrät.  Es  streiten  sich  zwei  Geister  um  mich. \r\nJm  Vertrauen  zu  den  Freundinnen  allein,  nicht  daß   es \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  221 \r\n\r\ndie  Freunde  vernehmen!  Ich  merke  wohl,  daß  es  meiner \r\nIphigenie  wunderlich  gegangen  ist:  man  war  die  erste \r\nForm  so  gewohnt,  man  kannte  die  Ausdrücke,  die  man \r\nsich  bei  öfterm  Hören  und  Lesen  zugeeignet  hatte;  nun \r\nklingt  das  alles  anders,  und  ich  sehe  wohl,  daß  im  Grunde \r\nmir  niemand  für  die  unendlichen  Bemühungen  dankt.  So \r\neine  .Arbeit  wird  eigentlich  nie  fertig,  man  muß  sie  für \r\nfertig  erklcären,  wenn  man  nach  Zeit  und  Umständen  das \r\nmöglichste  getan  hat. \r\n\r\nDoch  das  soll  mich  nicht  abschrecken,  mit  Tasso  eine \r\nähnliche  Operation  vorzunehmen.  Lieber  würf  ich  ihn \r\nins  Feuer;  aber  ich  will  bei  meinem  Entschluß  beharren, \r\nund  da  es  einmal  nicht  anders  ist,  so  wollen  wir  ein \r\nwunderlich  Werk  daraus  machen.  Deshalb  ist  mir's  ganz \r\nangenehm,  daß  es  mit  dem  Abdruck  meiner  Schriften  so \r\nlangsam  geht.  Und  dann  ist  es  doch  wieder  gut,  sich  in \r\neiniger  Ferne  vom  Setzer  bedroht  zu  sehen.  Wunderlich \r\ngenug,  daß  man  zu  der  freisten  Handlung  doch  einige \r\nNötigung  erwartet,  ja  fordert. \r\n\r\nWenn  man  in  Rom  gern  studieren  mag,  so  will  man  hier \r\nnur  leben;  man  vergißt  sich  und  die  Welt,  und  für  mich \r\nist  es  eine  wunderliche  Empfindung,  nur  mit  genießen- \r\nden Menschen  umzugehen.  Der  Ritter  Hamilton,  der \r\nnoch  immer  als  englischer  Gesandter  hier  lebt,  hat  nun, \r\nnach  so  langer  Kunstiiebhaberei,  nach  so  langem  Natur- \r\nstudium, den  Gipfel  aller  Natur-  und  Kunstfreude  in \r\neinem  schönen  Mädchen  gefunden.  Er  hat  sie  bei  sich, \r\neine  Engländerin  von  etwa  zwanzig  Jaliren.  Sie  ist  sehr \r\nschön  und  wohlgebaut.  Er  hat  ihr  ein  griechisch  Ge- \r\nwand machen  lassen,  das  sie  trefflich  kleidet;  dazu  löst \r\nsie  ihre  Haare  auf,  nimmt  ein  paar  Schals  und  macht \r\neine  Abwechslung  von  Stellungen,  Gebärden,  Mienen  usw., \r\ndaß  man  zuletzt  wirklich  meint,  man  träume.  Man  schaut, \r\nwas  so  viele  tausend  Künstler  gerne  geleistet  hätten,  hier \r\nganz  fertig,  in  Bewegung  und  überraschender  Abwechs- \r\nlung. Stehend,  knieend,  sitzend,  liegend,  ernst,  traurig, \r\nneckisch,  ausschweifend,  bußfertig,  lockend,  drohend, \r\nängsthch  usw.  Eins  folgt  aufs  andere  und  aus  dem  andern. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  2  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSie  weiß  zu  jedem  Ausdruck  die  Falten  des  Schleiers  zu \r\nwählen,  zu  wechseln  und  macht  sich  hundert  Arten  von \r\nKopfputz  mit  denselben  Tüchern.  Der  alte  Ritter  hält \r\ndas  Licht  dazu  und  hat  mit  ganzer  Seele  sich  diesem \r\nGegenstand  ergeben.  Er  findet  in  ihr  alle  Antiken,  alle \r\nschönen  Profile  der  sizilianischen  Münzen,  ja  den  Bel- \r\nveder 'sehen  Apoll  selbst.  So  viel  ist  gewiß,  der  Spaß \r\nist  einzig!  Wir  haben  ihn  schon  zwei  Abende  genossen. \r\nHeute  früh  malt  sie  Tischbein. \r\n\r\nVom  Personal  des  Hofs  und  den  Verhältnissen,  was  ich \r\nerfahren  und  kombiniert,  muß  erst  geprüft  und  geordnet \r\nwerden.  Heute  ist  der  König  auf  die  Wolfsjagd,  man \r\nhofft  wenigstens  fünfe  zu  erlegen. \r\n\r\nNeapel^  zum  ly.  März. \r\nWenn  ich  Worte  schreiben  will,  so  stehen  mir  immer \r\nBilder  vor  Augen,  des  fruchtbaren  Landes,  des  freien \r\nMeeres,  der  duftigen  Inseln,  des  rauchenden  Berges,  und \r\nmir  fehlen  die  Organe,  das  alles  darzustellen. \r\n\r\nHierzulande  begreift  man  erst,  wie  es  dem  Menschen \r\neinfallen  konnte,  das  Feld  zu  bauen,  hier,  wo  der  Acker \r\nalles  bringt,  und  wo  man  drei  bis  fünf  Ernten  des  Jahres \r\nhoffen  kann.  In  den  besten  Jahren  will  man  auf  dem- \r\nselben Acker  dreimal  Mais  gebaut  haben. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  viel  gesehen,  und  noch  mehr  gedacht;  die  Welt \r\neröffnet  sich  mehr  und  mehr;  auch  alles,  was  ich  schon \r\nlange  weiß,  wird  mir  erst  eigen.  Welch  ein  früh  wissen- \r\ndes und  spät  übendes  Geschöpf  ist  doch  der  Mensch! \r\n\r\nNur  schade,  daß  ich  nicht  in  jedem  Augenblick  meine \r\nBeobachtungen  mitteilen  kann;  zwar  ist  Tischbein  mit \r\nmir,  aber  als  Mensch  und  Künstler  wird  er  von  tausend \r\nGedanken  hin  und  her  getrieben,  von  hundert  Personen \r\nin  Anspruch  genommen.  Seine  Lage  ist  eigen  und  wun- \r\nderbar; er  kann  nicht  freien  Teil  an  eines  andern  Existenz \r\nnehmen,  weil  er  sein  eignes  Bestreben  so  eingeengt \r\nfühlt. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  223 \r\n\r\nUnd  doch  ist  die  Welt  nur  ein  einfach  Rad,  in  dem  gan- \r\nzen Umkreise  sich  gleich  und  gleich,  das  uns  aber  so \r\nwunderlich  vorkommt,  weil  wir  selbst  mit  herumgetrieben \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nWas  ich  mir  immer  sagte,  ist  eingetroffen:  daß  ich  so \r\nmanche  Phänomene  der  Natur  und  manche  Verworren- \r\nheiten der  Meinungen  erst  in  diesem  Lande  verstehen \r\nund  entwickeln  lerne.  Ich  fasse  von  allen  Seiten  zusam- \r\nmen und  bringe  viel  zurück,  auch  gewiß  viel  ^^aterlands- \r\nliebe  und  Freude  am  Leben  mit  wenigen  Freunden. \r\n\r\nÜber  meine  sizilianische  Reise  halten  die  Götter  noch \r\ndie  Wage  in  Händen;  das  Zünglein  schlägt  herüber  und \r\nhinüber. \r\n\r\nWer  mag  der  Freund  sein,  den  man  mir  so  geheimnisvoll \r\nankündigt?  Daß  ich  ihn  nur  nicht  über  meiner  Irr-  und \r\nInselfahrt  versäume! \r\n\r\nDie  Fregatte  von  Palermo  ist  wieder  zurück,  heut  über \r\nacht  Tage  geht  sie  abermals  von  hier  ab;  ob  ich  noch \r\nmitsegele,  zur  Karwoche  nach  Rom  zurückkehre,  weiß  ich \r\nnicht.  Noch  nie  bin  ich  so  unentschieden  gewesen;  ein \r\nAugenblick,  eine  Kleinigkeit  mag  entscheiden. \r\n\r\nMit  den  Menschen  geht  mir  es  schon  besser:  man  muß \r\nsie  nur  mit  dem  Krämergewicht,  keineswegs  mit  der  Gold- \r\nwage wiegen,  wie  es  leider  sogar  oft  Freunde  unterein- \r\nander aus  hypochondrischer  Grille  und  seltsamer  Anfor- \r\nderung zu  tun  pflegen. \r\n\r\nHier  wissen  die  Menschen  gar  nichts  voneinander,  sie \r\nmerken  kaum,  daß  sie  nebeneinander  hin  und  her  laufen; \r\nsie  rennen  den  ganzen  Tag  in  einem  Paradiese  hin  und \r\nwider,  ohne  sich  viel  umzusehen,  und  wenn  der  benach- \r\nbarte Höllenschlund  zu  toben  anfängt,  hilft  man  sich  mit \r\ndem  Blute  des  heiligen  Januarius,  wie  sich  die  übrige \r\nWelt  gegen  Tod  und  Teufel  auch  wohl  mit — Blute  hilft \r\noder  helfen  möchte. \r\n\r\n\r\n224  ITALIRNISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nZwischen  einer  so  unzählbaren  und  rastlos  bewegten \r\nMenge  durchzugehen,  ist  gar  merkwürdig  und  heilsam. \r\nWie  alles  durcheinander  strömt,  und  doch  jeder  Einzelne \r\nWeg  und  Ziel  findet.  In  so  großer  Gesellschaft  und  Be- \r\nwegung fühl  ich  mich  erst  recht  still  und  einsam;  je  mehr \r\ndie  Straßen  toben,  desto  ruhiger  werd  ich. \r\n\r\nManchmal  gedenke  ich  Rousseaus  und  seines  hypochon- \r\ndrischen Jammers;  und  doch  wird  mir  begreiflich,  wie \r\neine  so  schöne  Organisation  verschoben  werden  konnte. \r\nFühlt  ich  nicht  solchen  Anteil  an  den  natürlichen  Din- \r\ngen, und  sah  ich  nicht,  daß  in  der  scheinbaren  Ver- \r\nwirrung hundert  Beobachtungen  sich  vergleichen  und \r\nordnen  lassen,  wie  der  Feldmesser  mit  einer  durchge- \r\nzogenen Linie  viele  einzelne  Messungen  probiert,  ich \r\nhielte  mich  oft  selbst  für  toll. \r\n\r\nDen  i8.  März. \r\nNun  durften  wir  nicht  langer  säumen,  Herkulanum  und \r\ndie  ausgegrabene  Sammlung  in  Portici  zu  sehen.  Jene \r\nalte  Stadt,  am  Fuße  des  Vesuvs  liegend,  war  vollkommen \r\nmit  Lava  bedeckt,  die  sich  durch  nachfolgende  Aus- \r\nbrüche erhöhte,  so  daß  die  Gebäude  jetzt  sechzig  Fuß \r\nunter  der  Erde  liegen.  Man  entdeckte  sie,  indem  mau \r\neinen  Brunnen  grub  und  auf  getäfelte  Marmorfußböden \r\ntraf.  Jammerschade,  daß  die  Ausgrabung  nicht  durch \r\ndeutsche  Bergleute  recht  planmäßig  gesclielien;  denn  ge- \r\nwiß ist  bei  einem  zufällig-räuberischen  Nachwühlen  man- \r\nches edle  Altertum  vergeudet  worden.  Man  steigt  sechzig \r\nStufen  hinunter  in  eine  Gruft,  wo  man  das  ehmals  unter \r\nfreiem  Himmel  stehende  Theater  bei  Fackelschein  an- \r\nstaunt und  sich  erzählen  läßt,  was  alles  da  gefunden  und \r\nhinaufgeschafTt  worden. \r\n\r\nIn  das  Museum  traten  wir,  wohl  empfolilen  und  wohl \r\nempfangen.  Doch  war  auch  uns  irgend  etwas  aufzuzeich- \r\nnen nicht  erlaubt.  Vielleicht  gaben  wir  nur  desto  besser \r\nacht  und  versetzten  uns  desto  lebhafter  in  die  verschwun- \r\ndene Zeit,  wo  alle  diese  Dinge  zu  lebendigem  (Gebrauch \r\nund   Genuß   um   die   Eigentümer   umherstunden.     Jene \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  225 \r\n\r\nkleinen  Häuser  und  Zimmer  in  Pompeji  erschienen  mir \r\nmm  zugleich  enger  und  weiter:  enger,  weil  ich  sie  mir \r\nvon  so  viel  würdigen  Gegenständen  vollgedrängt  dachte, \r\nweiter,  weil  gerade  diese  Gegenstände  nicht  bloß  als \r\nnotdürftig  vorhanden,  sondern,  durch  bildende  Kunst  aufs \r\ngeistreichste  und  anmutigste  verziert  und  belebt,  den \r\nSinn  erfreuen  und  erweitern,  wie  es  die  größte  Hausge- \r\nräumigkeit nicht  tun  könnte. \r\n\r\nMan  sieht  zum  Beispiel  einen  herrlich  geformten  Eimer, \r\noben  mit  dem  zierlichsten  Rande;  näher  beschaut  schlägt \r\nsich  dieser  Rand  von  zwei  Seiten  in  die  Höhe,  man  faßt \r\ndie  verbundenen  Halbkreise  als  Handhabe  und  trägt  das \r\nGefäß  auf  das  bequemste.  Die  Lampen  sind  nach  An- \r\nzahl ihrer  Dochte  mit  Masken  und  Rankenwerk  verziert, \r\nso  daß  jede  Flamme  ein  wirkliches  Kunstgebilde  er- \r\nleuchtet. Hohe,  schlanke,  eherne  Gestelle  sind  bestimmt, \r\ndie  Lampen  zu  tragen,  aufzuhängende  Lampen  hingegen \r\nmit  allerlei  geistreich  gedachten  Figuren  behängt,  welche \r\ndie  Absicht,  zu  gefallen  und  zu  ergötzen,  sobald  sie \r\nschaukeln  und  baumeln,  sogar  übertreffen. \r\nIn  Hoffnung,  wiederzukehren,  folgten  wir  den  Vorzeigen- \r\nden von  Zimmer  zu  Zimmer  und  haschten,  wie  es  der \r\nMoment  erlaubte.  Ergötzung  und  Belehrung  weg,  so  gut \r\nes  sich  schicken  wollte. \r\n\r\nMontag  d€7i  ig.  März. \r\nIn  den  letzten  Tagen  hat  sich  ein  neues  Verhältnis  näher \r\nangeknüpft.  Nachdem  in  diesen  vier  Wochen  Tischbein \r\nmir  sein  treues  Geleit  durch  Natur-  und  Kunstgegen- \r\nstände förderlich  geleistet  und  wir  gestern  noch  zusam- \r\nmen in  Portici  gewesen,  ergab  sich  aus  wechselseitiger \r\nBetrachtung,  daß  seine  Kunstzwecke  sowohl  als  diejenigen \r\nGeschäfte,  die  er,  eine  künftige  Anstellung  in  Neapel \r\nhoffend,  in  der  Stadt  und  bei  Hofe  zu  betreiben  pflichtig \r\nist,  mit  meinen  Absichten,  Wünschen  und  Liebhabereien \r\nnicht  zu  verbinden  seien.  Er  schlug  mir  daher,  immer \r\nfür  mich  besorgt,  einen  jungen  Mann  vor  als  beständigen \r\nGesellschafter,  den  ich  seit  den  ersten  Tagen  öfter  sah, \r\nnicht  ohne  Teilnahme  und  Neigimg.    Es  ist  Kniep,  der \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  15 \r\n\r\n\r\n2  2  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nsich  eine  Zeitlang  in  Rom  aufgehalten,  sodann  sich  aber \r\nnach  Neapel,  in  das  eigentlichste  Element  des  Land- \r\nschafters begeben  hatte.  Schon  in  Rom  hörte  ich  ihn  als \r\neinen  geschickten  Zeichner  preisen,  nur  seiner  Tätigkeit \r\nwollte  man  nicht  gleiches  Lob  erteilen.  Ich  habe  ihn \r\nschon  ziemlich  kennen  gelernt  und  möchte  diesen  ge- \r\nrügten Mangel  eher  Unentschlossenheit  nennen,  die  gewiß \r\nzu  überwinden  ist,  wenn  wir  eine  Zeitlang  beisammen \r\nsind.  Ein  glücklicher  Anfang  bestätigt  mir  diese  Hoffnung, \r\nund  wenn  es  mir  nach  geht,  sollen  wir  auf  geraume  Zeit \r\ngute  Gesellen  bleiben. \r\n\r\n'/.um  ig.  März. \r\nMan  darf  nur  auf  der  Straße  wandeln  und  Augen  haben, \r\nman  sieht  die  unnachahmlichsten  Ijilder. \r\nAm  Molo,  einer  Hauptlärmecke  der  Stadt,  sah  ich  gestern \r\neinen  Policinel,  der  sich  auf  einem  Brettergerüste  mit \r\neinem  kleinen  Affen  stritt,  drüber  einen  Balkon,  auf  dem \r\nein  recht  artiges  Mädchen  ihre  Reize  feilbot.  Neben  dem \r\nAffengerüste  ein  Wunderdoktor,  der  seine  Arcana  gegen \r\nalle  Übel  den  Ijedrängten  (jläul^igen  darbot;  von  Gerhard \r\nDow  gemalt,  hätte  solch  ein  Bild  verdient,  Zeitgenossen \r\nund  Nachwelt  zu  ergötzen. \r\n\r\nSo  war  auch  heute  Fest  des  heiligen  Josephs;  er  ist  der \r\nPatron  aller  Frittaruolen,  d.  h.  Gebacknesmacher,  versteht \r\n.  sich  Gebacknes  im  gröbsten  Sinne.  Weil  nun  immerfort \r\nstarke  Flammen  unter  schwarzem  und  siedendem  Öl  her- \r\nvorschlagen, so  gehört  auch  alle  Feuerqual  in  ihr  Fach; \r\ndeswegen  hatten  sie  gestern  abend  vor  den  Häusern  mit \r\nGemälden  zum  besten  aufgeputzt:  Seelen  im  Fegfeuer, \r\nJüngste  Gerichte  glühten  und  flammten  umher.  Große \r\nPfannen  standen  vor  der  Türe  auf  leicht  gebauten  Herden. \r\nVAn  Gesell  wirkte  den  Teig,  ein  anderer  formte,  zog  ihn \r\nzu  Kringlen  und  warf  sie  in  die  siedende  Fettigkeit.  An \r\nder  Pfanne  stand  ein  dritter,  mit  einem  kleinen  Bratspieße; \r\ner  holte  die  Kringlen,  wie  sie  gar  wurden,  heraus,  schob \r\nsie  einem  vierten  auf  ein  ander  Spießchen,  der  sie  den \r\nUmstehenden  anbot;  die  beiden  letzten  waren  junge \r\nBursche  mit  blonden  und  lockenreichen  Perücken,  wel- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  227 \r\n\r\nches  hier  Engel  bedeutet.  Noch  einige  Figuren  voll- \r\nendeten die  Gruppe,  reichten  Wein  den  Beschäftigten, \r\ntranken  selbst  und  schrieen,  die  Wai-e  zu  loben;  auch  die \r\nEngel,  die  Köche,  alle  schrieen.  Das  Volk  drängte  sich \r\nherzu,  denn  alles  Gebackene  wird  diesen  Abend  wohlfeiler \r\ngegeben  und  sogar  ein  Teil  der  Einnahme  den  Armen. \r\nDergleichen  könnte  man  endlos  erzählen;  so  geht  es  mit \r\njedem  Tage,  immer  etwas  Neues  und  Tolleres.  Nur  die \r\nMannigfaltigkeit  von  Kleidern,  die  einem  auf  der  Straße \r\nbegegnet,  die  Menge  Menschen  in  der  einzigen  Straße \r\nToledo! \r\n\r\nUnd  so  gibt  es  noch  manche  originale  Unterhaltung,  wenn \r\nman  mit  dem  Volke  lebt;  es  ist  so  natürlich,  daß  man \r\nmit  ihm  natürlich  werden  könnte.  Da  ist  zum  Beispiel \r\nder  Pulcinell,  die  eigentliche  Nationalmaske,  der  Harle- \r\nkin aus  Bergamo,  Hanswurst  aus  Tirol  gebürtig.  Pulcinell \r\nnun,  ein  wahrhaft  gelassener,  ruhiger,  bis  auf  einen  ge- \r\nwissen Grad  gleichgültiger,  beinah  fauler  und  doch  humo- \r\nristischer Knecht.  Und  so  findet  man  überall  Kellner \r\nund  Hausknecht.  Mit  dem  unsrigen  macht  ich  mir  heute \r\neine  besondere  Lust,  und  es  war  weiter  nichts,  als  daß \r\nich  ihn  schickte,  Papier  und  Federn  zu  holen.  Halber \r\nMißverstand,  Zaudern,  guter  Wille  und  Schalkheit  brachte \r\ndie  anmutigste  Szene  hervor,  die  man  auf  jedem  Theater \r\nmit  Glück  produzieren  könnte. \r\n\r\nDienstag  den  20.  März. \r\nDie  Kunde  einer  soeben  ausbrechenden  Lava,  die,  für \r\nNeapel  unsichtbar,  nach  Ottajano  hinunterfließt,  reizte \r\nmich,  zum  dritten  Male  den  Vesuv  zu  besuchen.  Kaum \r\nwar  ich  am  Fuße  desselben  aus  meinem  zweirädrigen, \r\neinpferdigen  Fuhrwerk  gesprungen,  so  zeigten  sich  schon \r\njene  beiden  Führer,  die  uns  früher  hinauf  begleitet  hatten. \r\nIch  wollte  keinen  missen  und  nahm  den  einen  aus  Ge- \r\nwohnheit und  Dankbarkeit,  den  andern  aus  Vertrauen, \r\nbeide  der  mehreren  Bequemlichkeit  wegen  mit  mir. \r\nAuf  die  Höhe  gelangt,  blieb  der  eine  bei  den  Mänteln \r\nund  Viktualien,  der  jüngere  folgte  mir,  und  wir  gingen \r\nmutig  auf  einen  ungeheuren  Dampf  los,    der   unterhalb \r\n\r\n\r\n2  2  8  ITAIJENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ndes  Kegelschlundes  aus  dem  Berge  brach;  sodann  schritten \r\nwir  an  dessen  Seite  her  gelind  hinabwärts,  bis  wir  endlich \r\nunter  klarem  Himmel  aus  dem  wilden  Dampfgewölke  die \r\nLava  hervorquellen  sahen. \r\n\r\nMan  habe  auch  tausendmal  von  einem  Gegenstande  ge- \r\nhört, das  Eigentümliche  desselben  spricht  nur  zu  uns \r\naus  dem  unmittelbaren  Anschauen.  Die  Lava  war  schmal, \r\nvielleicht  nicht  breiter  als  zehn  Fuß;  allein  die  Art,  wie \r\nsie  eine  sanfte,  ziemlich  ebene  Fläche  hinabfloß,  war  auf- \r\nfallend genug:  denn  indem  sie  während  des  Fortfließens \r\nan  den  Seiten  und  an  der  Oberfläche  verkühlt,  so  bildet \r\nsich  ein  Kanal,  der  sich  immer  erhöht,  weil  das  ge- \r\nschmolzene Material  auch  unterhalb  des  Feuerstroms  er- \r\nstarrt, welcher  die  auf  der  Oberfläche  schwimmenden \r\nSchlacken  rechts  und  links  gleichförmig  hinunterwirft, \r\nwodurch  sich  denn  nach  und  nach  ein  Damm  erhöht, \r\nauf  welchem  der  Glutstrom  ruhig  fortfließt  wie  ein  Miihl- \r\nbach.  Wir  gingen  neben  dem  ansehnlich  erhöhten  Damme \r\nher,  die  Schlacken  rollten  regelmäßig  an  den  Seiten  her- \r\nunter bis  zu  unsern  Füßen.  Durch  einige  Lücken  des \r\nKanals  konnten  wir  den  Glutstrom  von  unten  sehen  und, \r\nwie  er  weiter  hinabfloß,  ihn  von  oben  beobachten. \r\nDurch  die  hellste  Sonne  erschien  die  Glut  verdüstert, \r\nnur  ein  mäßiger  Rauch  .stieg  in  die  reine  Luft.  Ich  hatte \r\nVerlangen,  mich  dem  Punkte  zu  nähern,  wo  sie  aus  dem \r\nBerge  bricht;  dort  sollte  sie,  wie  mein  Führer  versicherte, \r\nsogleich  Gewölb  und  Dach  über  sich  her  bilden,  auf \r\nwelchem  er  öfters  gestanden  habe.  Auch  dieses  zu  sehen \r\nund  zu  erfahren,  stiegen  wir  den  Berg  wieder  hinauf,  um \r\njenem  Punkte  von  hinten  her  beizukommen.  Glücklicher- \r\nweise fanden  wir  die  Stelle  durch  einen  lebhaften  Wind- \r\nzug entblößt,  freilich  nicht  ganz,  denn  ringsum  qualmte \r\nder  Dampfaus  tausend  Ritzen;  und  nun  standen  wir  wirk- \r\nlich auf  der  breiartig  gewundenen  erstarrten  Decke,  die \r\nsich  aber  so  weit  vorwärts  erstreckte,  daß  wir  die  Lava \r\nnicht  konnten  heraus(|uellen  sehen. \r\n\r\nWir  versuchten  noch  ein  paar  Dutzend  Schritte,  aber  der \r\nBoden  ward  immer  glühender;  sonneverfinsternd  und  er- \r\nstickend wirbelte  ein  unüberwindlicher  Qualm.   Der  vor- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  229 \r\n\r\nausgegangene  Führer  kehrte  bald  um,  ergriff  mich,  und \r\nwir  entwanden  uns  diesem  Höllenprudel. \r\nNachdem  wir  die  Augen  an  der  Aussicht,  Gaumen  und \r\nBrust  aber  am  Weine  gelabt,  gingen  wir  umher,  noch \r\nandere  Zufälligkeiten  dieses  mitten  im  Paradies  aufge- \r\ntürmten Höllengipfels  zu  beobachten.  Einige  Schlünde, \r\ndie  als  vulkanische  Essen  keinen  Rauch,  aber  eine  glühende \r\nLuft  fortwährend  gewaltsam  ausstoßen,  betrachtete  ich \r\nwüeder  mit  Aufmerksamkeit.  Ich  sah  sie  durchaus  mit \r\neinem  tropfsteinartigen  Material  tapeziert,  welches  zitzen- \r\nund  zapfenartig  die  Schlünde  bis  oben  bekleidete.  Bei \r\nder  Ungleichheit  der  Essen  fanden  sich  mehrere  dieser \r\nherabhängenden  Dunstprodukte  ziemlich  zur  Hand,  so  daß \r\nwir  sie  mit  unsern  Stäben  und  einigen  hakenartigen  Vor- \r\nrichtungen gar  wohl  gewinnen  konnten.  Bei  dem  Lava- \r\nhändler hatte  ich  schon  dergleichen  Exemplare  unter \r\nder  Rubrik  der  wirklichen  Laven  gefunden,  und  ich  freute \r\nmich,  entdeckt  zu  haben,  daß  es  vulkanischer  Ruß  sei, \r\nabgesetzt  aus  den  heißen  Schwaden,  die  darin  enthaltenen \r\nverflüchtigten  mineralischen  Teile  offenbarend. \r\nDer  herrlichste  Sonnenuntergang,  ein  himmlischer  Abend \r\nerquickten  mich  auf  meiner  Rückkehr;  doch  konnte  ich \r\nempfinden,  wüe  sinneverwirrend  ein  ungeheurer  Gegen- \r\nsatz sich  erweise.  Das  Schreckliche  zum  Schönen,  das \r\nSchöne  zum  Schrecklichen,  beides  hebt  einander  auf  und \r\nbringt  eine  gleichgültige  Empfindung  hervor.  Gewiß  wäre \r\nder  Neapolitaner  ein  anderer  Mensch,  wenn  er  sich  nicht \r\nzwischen  Gott  und  Satan  eingeklemmt  fühlte. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  März. \r\nTriebe  mich  nicht  die  deutsche  Sinnesart  und  das  Ver- \r\nlangen, mehr  zu  lernen  und  zu  tun  als  zu  genießen,  so \r\nsollte  ich  in  dieser  Schule  des  leichten  und  lustigen \r\nLebens  noch  einige  Zeit  verweilen  und  mehr  zu  profi- \r\ntieren suchen.  Es  ist  hier  gar  vergnüglich  sein,  wenn \r\nman  sich  nur  ein  klein  wenig  einrichten  könnte.  Die  Lage \r\nder  Stadt,  die  Milde  des  Klimas  kann  nie  genug  gerühmt \r\nwerden;  aber  darauf  ist  auch  der  Fremde  fast  allein  an- \r\ngewiesen. \r\n\r\n\r\n23 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nFreilich,  wer  sich  Zeit  nimmt,  Geschick  und  Vermögen \r\nhat,  kann  sich  auch  hier  breit  und  gut  niederlassen.  So \r\nhat  sich  Hamilton  eine  schöne  Existenz  gemacht  und  ge- \r\nnießt sie  nun  am  Abend  seines  Lebens.  Die  Zimmer,  die \r\ner  sich  in  englischem  Geschmack  einrichtete,  sind  aller- \r\nliebst und  die  Aussicht  aus  dem  Eckzimmer  vielleicht \r\neinzig.  Unter  uns  das  Meer,  im  Angesicht  Capri,  rechts \r\nder  Posilipp,  ncäher  der  Spaziergang  Villa  reale,  links  ein \r\naltes  Jesuitengebäude,  weiterhin  die  Küste  von  Sorrent \r\nbis  ans  Kap  Minerva.  Dergleichen  möcht  es  wohl  in \r\nEuropa  schwerlich  zum  zweiten  Male  geben,  wenigstens \r\nnicht  im  Mittelpunkte  einer  großen  bevölkerten  Stadt. \r\nHamilton  ist  ein  Mann  von  allgemeinem  Geschmack  und, \r\nnachdem  er  alle  Reiche  der  Schöpfung  durchwandert,  an \r\nein  schönes  Weib,  das  Meisterstück  des  großen  Künst- \r\nlers, gelangt. \r\n\r\nUnd  nun  nach  allem  diesem  und  hundertfältigem  Genuß \r\nlocken  mich  die  Sirenen  jenseits  des  Meeres,  und  wenn \r\nder  Wind  gut  ist,  geh  ich  mit  diesem  Briefe  zugleich  ab, \r\ner  nordwärts,  ich  südwärts.  Des  Menschen  Sinn  ist  un- \r\nbändig, ich  besonders  bedarf  der  Weite  gar  sehr.  Nicht \r\nsowohl  das  Beharren  als  ein  schnelles  Auffassen  muß \r\njetzt  mein  Augenmerk  sein.  Hab  ich  einem  Gegenstande \r\nnur  die  Spitze  des  Fingers  abgewonnen,  so  kann  ich  mir \r\ndie  ganze  Hand  durch  Hören  und  Denken  wohl  zu- \r\neignen. \r\n\r\nSeltsamerweise  erinnert  mich  ein  Freund  in  diesen  Tagen \r\nan  Wilhelm  Meister  und  verlangt  dessen  Fortsetzung: \r\nunter  diesem  Himmel  möchte  sie  wohl  nicht  möglich \r\nsein;  vielleicht  läßt  sich  von  dieser  Himmelsluft  den \r\nletzten  Büchern  etwas  mitteilen.  Möge  meine  Existenz \r\nsich  dazu  genugsam  entwickeln,  der  Stengel  mehr  in  die \r\nLänge  rücken  und  die  Blumen  reicher  und  schöner  hervor- \r\nbrechen. Gewiß,  es  wäre  besser, .ich  käme  gar  nicht  wieder, \r\nwenn  ich  nicht  wiedergeboren  zurückkommen  kann. \r\n\r\nZum  22.  März. \r\nHeute  sahen  wir  ein  Bild  von  Correggio,  das  verkäuflich \r\nist,  zwar  nicht  vollkommen  erhalten,  das  aber  doch  das \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  231 \r\n\r\nglücklichste  Gepräg  des  Reizes  unausgeloscht  mit  sich \r\nführt.  Es  stellt  eine  Mutter  Gottes  vor,  das  Kind  in  dem \r\nAugenblicke,  da  es  zwischen  der  Mutter  Brust  und  einigen \r\nBirnen,  die  ihm  ein  Engelchen  darreicht,  zweifelhaft  ist. \r\nAlso  eine  Entwöhnung  Christi.  Mir  scheint  die  Idee \r\näußerst  zart,  die  Komposition  bewegt,  natürlich  und \r\nglücklich,  höchst  reizend  ausgeführt.  Es  erinnert  sogleich \r\nan  das  Verlöbnis  der  heiligen  Katharina  und  scheint  mir \r\nunbezweifelt  von  Correggios  Hand. \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  23.  März. \r\nNun  hat  sich  das  Verhältnis  zu  Kniep  auf  eine  recht  prak- \r\ntische Weise  ausgebildet  und  befestigt.  Wir  waren  zu- \r\nsammen in  Pästum,  woselbst  er,  so  wie  auf  der  Hin-  und \r\nHerreise,  mit  Zeichnen  sich  auf  das  tätigste  erwies.  Die \r\nherrlichsten  Umrisse  sind  gewonnen;  ihn  freut  nun  selbst \r\ndieses  bewegte,  arbeitsame  Leben,  wodurch  ein  Talent \r\naufgeregt  wird,  das  er  sich  selbst  kaum  zutraute.  Hier \r\ngilt  es  resolut  sein;  aber  gerade  hier  zeigt  sich  seine  ge- \r\nnaue und  reinliche  Fertigkeit.  Das  Papier,  worauf  ge- \r\nzeichnet werden  soll,  mit  einem  rechtwinkligen  Viereck \r\nzu  umziehen,  versäumt  er  niemals;  die  besten  englischen \r\nBleistifte  zuspitzen  und  immer  wieder  zuspitzen,  ist  ihm \r\nfast  eine  ebenso  große  Lust  als  zu  zeichnen:  dafür  sind \r\naber  auch  seine  Konture,  was  man  wünschen  kann. \r\nNun  haben  wir  folgendes  verabredet.  Von  heute  an  leben \r\nund  reisen  wir  zusammen,  ohne  daß  er  weiter  für  etwas \r\nsorgt  als  zu  zeichnen,  wie  diese  Tage  geschehen.  Alle \r\nKonture  gehören  mein;  damit  aber  nach  unserer  Rück- \r\nkehr daraus  ein  ferneres  Wirken  für  ihn  entspringe,  so \r\nführt  er  eine  Anzahl  auszuwählender  Gegenstände  bis  auf \r\neine  gewisse  bestimmte  Summe  für  mich  aus;  da  sich \r\ndenn  indessen  bei  seiner  Geschicklichkeit,  bei  der  Bedeut- \r\nsamkeit der  zu  erobernden  Aussichten  und  sonst  wohl  das \r\nweitere  ergeben  wird.  Diese  Einrichtung  macht  mich  ganz \r\nglücklich,  und  jetzt  erst  kann  ich  von  unserer  Fahrt  kurze \r\nRechenschaft  geben. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  zweirädrigen  leichten  Fuhrwerk  sitzend  und \r\nwechselsweise  die  Zügel  führend,  einen  gutmütigen  rohen \r\n\r\n\r\n2  32  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nKnaben  hintenauf,  rollten  wir  durch  die  herrliche  Gegend, \r\nwelche  Kniep  mit  malerischem  Auge  begrüßte.  Nun  er- \r\nreichten wir  die  Gebirgsschlucht,  die  man,  auf  dem  glatte- \r\nsten Fahrdamme  durchrennend,  an  den  köstlichsten  Wald- \r\nund  Felspartien  vorbeiHiegt.  Da  konnte  denn  Kniep  zu- \r\nletzt sich  nicht  enthalten,  in  der  Gegend  von  La  Cava \r\neinen  prächtigen  Berg,  welcher  sich  gerade  vor  uns  scharf \r\nam  Himmel  abzeichnete,  nicht  weniger  die  Seiten,  sowie \r\nden  Fuß  dieser  Höhe  reinlich  und  charakteristisch  im \r\nUmriß  aufs  Papier  zu  befestigen.  Wir  freuten  uns  beide \r\ndaran,  als  an  dem  Einstand  unserer  Verbindung. \r\nEin  gleicher  Umriß  ward  abends  aus  den  Fenstern  von \r\nSalern  genommen,  welcher  mich  aller  Beschi-eibung  über- \r\nheben wird,  einer  ganz  einzig  lieblichen  und  fruchtbaren \r\nGegend.  Wer  wäre  nicht  geneigt  gewesen,  an  diesem \r\nOrte  zu  studieren,  zur  schönen  Zeit  der  blühenden  hohen \r\nSchule?  Beim  frühsten  Morgen  fuhren  wir  auf  unge- \r\nbahnten, oft  morastigen  Wegen  einem  Paar  schön  ge- \r\nformten Bergen  zu;  wir  kamen  durch  Bach  und  Gewässer, \r\nwo  wir  den  nilpferdischen  Büfteln  in  die  blutroten  wilden \r\nAugen  sahen. \r\n\r\nDas  Land  ward  immer  flacher  und  wüster,  wenige  Ge- \r\nbäude deuteten  auf  kärgliche  Landwirtschaft.  Endlich, \r\nungewiß,  ob  wir  durch  Felsen  oder  Trümmer  führen, \r\nkonnten  wir  einige  große,  länglich-viereckige  Massen,  die \r\nwir  in  der  Ferne  schon  bemerkt  hatten,  als  überbliebene \r\nTempel  und  Denkmale  einer  ehemals  so  prächtigen  Stadt \r\nunterscheiden.  Kniep,  welcher  schon  unterwegs  die  zwei \r\nmalerischen  Kalkgebirge  umrissen,  suchte  sich  schnell \r\neinen  Standpunkt,  von  wo  aus  das  Eigentümliche  dieser \r\nvöllig  unmalerischen  Gegend  aufgefaßt  und  dargestellt \r\nwerden  könnte. \r\n\r\nVon  einem  Landmanne  ließ  ich  mich  indessen  in  den  Ge- \r\nbäuden herumführen;  der  erste  Eindruck  konnte  nur  Er- \r\nstaunen erregen.  Ich  befand  mich  in  einer  völlig  fremden \r\nWelt.  Denn  wie  die  Jahrhunderte  sich  aus  dem  Ernsten \r\nin  das  Gefällige  bilden,  so  bilden  sie  den  Menschen  mit, \r\nja  sie  erzeugen  ihn  so.  Nun  sind  unsere  Augen  und  durch \r\nsie  unser  \"anzes  inneres  Wesen  an  schlankere  Baukunst \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  233 \r\n\r\nhinangetrieben  und  entschieden  bestimmt,  so  daß  uns \r\ndiese  stumpfen,  kegelförmigen,  enggedrängten  Säulen- \r\nmassen lästig,  ja  furchtbar  erscheinen.  Doch  nahm  ich \r\nmich  bald  zusammen,  erinnerte  mich  der  Kunstgeschichte, \r\ngedachte  der  Zeit,  deren  Geist  solche  Bauart  gemäß  fand, \r\nvergegenwärtigte  mir  den  strengen  Stil  der  Plastik,  und \r\nin  weniger  als  einer  Stunde  fühlte  ich  mich  befreundet, \r\nja  ich  pries  den  Genius,  daß  er  mich  diese  so  wohl  er- \r\nhaltenen Reste  mit  Augen  sehen  ließ,  da  sich  von  ihnen \r\ndurch  Abbildung  kein  Begriff  geben  läßt.  Denn  im  archi- \r\ntektonischen Aufriß  erscheinen  sie  eleganter,  in  perspek- \r\ntivischer Darstellung  plumper,  als  sie  sind;  nur  wenn  man \r\nsich  um  sie  her,  durch  sie  durch  bewegt,  teilt  man  ihnen \r\ndas  eigentliche  Leben  mit:  man  fühlt  es  wieder  aus  ihnen \r\nheraus,  welches  der  Baumeister  beabsichtigte,  ja  hinein- \r\nschuf. Und  so  verbrachte  ich  den  ganzen  Tag,  indessen \r\nKniep  nicht  säumte,  uns  die  genausten  Umrisse  zuzueig- \r\nnen. Wie  froh  war  ich,  von  dieser  Seite  ganz  unbesorgt \r\nzu  sein  und  für  die  Erinnerung  so  sichere  Merkzeichen \r\nzu  gewinnen!  Leider  war  keine  Gelegenheit,  hier  zu  über- \r\nnachten; wir  kehrten  nach  Salern  zurück,  und  den  andern \r\nMorgen  ging  es  zeitig  nach  Neapel.  Der  Vesuv,  von  der \r\nRückseite  gesehn,  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Gegend;  Pappeln, \r\npyramidal-kolossal,  an  der  Chaussee  im  Vordergrunde. \r\nDies  war  auch  ein  angenehmes  Bild,  das  wir  durch  ein \r\nkurzes  Stillhalten  erwarben. \r\n\r\nNun  en'eichten  wir  eine  Höhe;  der  größte  Anblick  tat \r\nsich  vor  uns  auf.  Neapel  in  seiner  Herrlichkeit,  die \r\nmeilenlange  Reihe  von  Häusern  am  flachen  Ufer  des \r\nGolfs  hin,  die  Vorgebirge,  Erdzungen,  Felswände,  dann \r\ndie  Inseln  und  dahinter  das  Meer  war  ein  entzückender \r\nAnblick. \r\n\r\nEin  gräßlicher  Gesang,  vielmehr  Lustgeschrei  und  Freude  - \r\ngeheul des  hinten  aufstehenden  Knaben  erschreckte  und \r\nstörte  mich.  Heftig  fuhr  ich  ihn  an;  er  hatte  noch  kein \r\nböses  Wort  von  uns  gehört,  er  war  der  gutmütigste  Junge. \r\nEine  Weile  rührte  er  sich  nicht,  dann  klopfte  er  mir  sachte \r\nauf  die  Schulter,  streckte  seinen  rechten  Arm  mit  auf- \r\ngehobenem  Zeigefinger  zwischen  uns  durch  und   sagte: \r\n\r\n\r\n234  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSignor,  perdonate!  questa  e  la  mia  patria!  Das  heißt  ver- \r\ndolmetscht: Herr,  verzeiht!  ist  das  doch  mein  Vaterland I \r\nUnd  so  war  ich  zum  zweiten  Male  überrascht.  Mir  armen \r\nNordländer  kam  etwas  Tränenartiges  in  die  Augen! \r\n\r\nDen  25.  März.  Verkündigung  Maria. \r\nOb  ich  gleich  empfand,  daß  Kniep  sehr  gern  mit  mir \r\nnach  Sizilien  gehe,  so  konnte  ich  doch  bemerken,  daß  er \r\nungern  etwas  zurückließ.  Bei  seiner  Aufrichtigkeit  blieb \r\nmir  nicht  lange  verborgen,  daß  ihm  ein  Liebchen  eng \r\nund  treu  verbunden  sei.  Wie  sie  zusammen  bekannt  ge- \r\nworden, war  artig  genug  zu  hören;  wie  sich  das  Mädchen \r\nbisher  betragen,  konnte  für  sie  einnehmen;  nun  sollte  ich \r\nsie  aber  auch  sehen,  wie  hübsch  sie  sei.  Hiezu  war  An- \r\nstalt getrofien,  und  zwar  so,  daß  ich  zugleich  eine  der \r\nschönsten  Aussichten  über  Neapel  genießen  könnte.  Er \r\nführte  mich  auf  das  flache  Dach  eines  Hauses,  von  wo \r\nman  besonders  den  untern  Teil  der  Stadt  nach  dem  Molo \r\nzu,  den  Golf,  die  Küste  von  Sorrent  vollkommen  über- \r\nsehen konnte;  alles  weiter  rechts  Liegende  verschob  sich \r\nauf  die  sonderbarste  Weise,  wie  man  es,  ohne  auf  diesem \r\nPunkte  zu  stehen,  nicht  leicht  sehen  wird.  Neapel  ist \r\nüberall  schön  und  herrlich. \r\n\r\nAls  wir  nun  die  Gegend  bewunderten,  stieg,  obgleich  er- \r\nwartet, doch  unversehens,  ein  gar  artiges  Köpfchen  aus \r\ndem  Boden  hervor:  denn  zu  einem  solchen  Söller  macht \r\nnur  eine  länglich  viereckige  Öfthung  im  Estrich,  welche \r\nmit  einer  Falltüre  zugedeckt  werden  kann,  den  Eingang. \r\nUnd  da  nun  das  Engelchen  völlig  hervortrat,  fiel  mir  ein, \r\ndaß  ältere  Künstler  die  Verkündigung  Maria  also  vor- \r\nstellen, daß  der  Engel  eine  Treppe  heraufkömmt.  Dieser \r\nEngel  aber  war  nun  wirklich  von  gar  schöner  Gestalt, \r\nhübschem  Gesichtchen  und  einem  guten  natürlichen  Be- \r\ntragen. Es  freute  mich,  unter  dem  herrlichen  Himmel \r\nund  im  Angesicht  der  schönsten  Gegend  von  der  Welt, \r\nmeinen  neuen  Freund  so  glücklich  zu  sehen.  Er  gestand \r\nmir,  als  sie  sich  wieder  entfernt  hatte,  daß  er  eben  des- \r\nhalb eine  freiwillige  Armut  bisher  getragen,  weil  er  dabei \r\nsich  zugleich  ihrer  Liebe  erfreut  und  ihre  Genüg.samkeit \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  235 \r\n\r\nschätzen  lernen;  nun  sollten  ihm  auch  seine  bessern  Aus- \r\nsichten und  ein  reichlicher  Zustand  vorzüglich  deshalb \r\nwünschenswert  sein,  damit  er  auch  ihr  bessere  Tage  be- \r\nreiten könne. \r\n\r\nZum  2£.  Äfärz. \r\nNach  diesem  angenehmen  Abenteuer  spazierte  ich  am \r\nMeere  hin  und  war  still  und  vergnüglich.  Da  kam  mir \r\neine  gute  Erleuchtung  über  botanische  Gegenstände. \r\nHerdern  bitte  ich  zu  sagen,  daß  ich  mit  der  Urpflanze \r\nbald  zustande  bin;  nur  fürchte  ich,  daß  niemand  die  übrige \r\nPflanzenwelt  darin  wird  erkennen  wollen.  Meine  famose \r\nLehre  von  den  Kotyledonen  ist  so  sublimiert,  daß  man \r\nschwerlich  wird  weiter  gehen  können. \r\n\r\nDen  26.  März. \r\nMorgen  geht  dieser  Brief  von  hier  zu  euch.  Donnerstag \r\nden  29.  geh  ich  mit  der  Korvette,  die  ich,  des  Seewesens \r\nunkundig,  in  meinem  vorigen  Briefe  zum  Rang  einer  Fre- \r\ngatte erhob,  endlich  nach  Palermo.  Der  Zweifel,  ob  ich \r\nreisen  oder  bleiben  sollte,  machte  einen  Teil  meines  hie- \r\nsigen Aufenthaltes  unruhig;  nun,  da  ich  entschlossen  bin, \r\ngeht  es  besser.  Für  meine  Sinnesart  ist  diese  Reise  heil- \r\nsam, ja  notwendig.  Sizilien  deutet  mir  nach  Asien  und \r\nAfrika,  und  auf  dem  wundersamen  Punkte,  wohin  so  viele \r\nRadien  der  Weltgeschichte  gerichtet  sind,  selbst  zu  stehen, \r\nist  keine  Kleinigkeit. \r\n\r\nNeapel  habe  ich  nach  seiner  eignen  Art  behandelt:  ich \r\nwar  nichts  weniger  als  fleißig,  doch  hab  ich  viel  gesehen \r\nund  mir  einen  allgemeinen  Begriff  von  dem  Lande,  seinen \r\nEinwohnern  und  Zuständen  gebildet.  Bei  der  Wiederkehr \r\nsoll  manches  nachgeholt  werden,  freilich  nur  manches: \r\ndenn  vor  dem  29.  Juni  muß  ich  wieder  in  Rom  sein. \r\nHab  ich  die  heilige  Woche  versäumt,  so  will  ich  dort \r\nwenigstens  den  St.  Peterstag  feiern.  Meine  sizilianische \r\nReise  darf  mich  nicht  allzuweit  von  meiner  ersten  Absicht \r\nweglenken. \r\n\r\nVorgestern  hatten  wir  ein  gewaltiges  Wetter  mit  Donner, \r\nBhtz  und  Regengüssen;  jetzt  hat  sich's  wieder  ausgehellt, \r\n\r\n\r\n236  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\neine  herrliche  Tramontane  weht  herüber;  bleibt  sie  be- \r\nständig, so  haben  wir  die  schnellste  Fahrt. \r\nGestern  war  ich  mit  meinem  Gefährten,  unser  Schiff  zu \r\nbesehen  und  das  Kämmerchen  zu  besuchen,  das  uns  auf- \r\nnehmen soll.  Eine  Seereise  fehlte  mir  ganz  in  meinen \r\nBegriffen;  diese  kleine  Überfahrt,  vielleicht  eine  Küsten- \r\numschiffung,  wird  meiner  Einbildungskraft  nachhelfen  und \r\nmir  die  Welt  erweitern.  Der  Kapitän  ist  ein  junger,  mun- \r\nterer Mann,  das  Schiff  gar  zierlich  und  nett,  in  Amerika \r\ngebaut,  ein  guter  Segler. \r\n\r\nHier  fängt  nun  alles  an,  grün  zu  werden,  in  Sizilien  find \r\nich  es  noch  weiter.  Wenn  ihr  diesen  Brief  erhaltet,  bin \r\nich  auf  der  Rückreise  und  habe  Trinakrien  hinter  mir. \r\nSo  ist  der  Mensch:  immer  springt  er  in  Gedanken  vor- \r\nund  rückwärts;  ich  war  noch  nicht  dort  und  bin  schon \r\nwieder  bei  euch.  Doch  an  der  Verworrenheit  dieses \r\nBriefes  bin  ich  nicht  schuld,  jeden  Augenblick  werd  ich \r\nunterbrochen  und  möchte  doch  gern  dies  Blatt  zu  Ende \r\nschreiben. \r\n\r\nSoeben  besuchte  mich  ein  Marchese  Berio,  ein  junger \r\nMann,  der  viel  zu  wissen  scheint.  Er  wollte  den  Verfasser \r\ndes  Werther  doch  auch  kennen  lernen.  Überhaupt  ist  hier \r\ngroßer  Drang  und  Lust  nach  Bildung  und  Wissen.  Sie \r\nsind  nur  zu  glücklich,  um  auf  den  rechten  Weg  zu  kom- \r\nmen. Hätte  ich  nur  mehr  Zeit,  so  wollt  ich  ihnen  gern \r\nmehr  Zeit  geben.  Diese  vier  Wochen  —  was  waren  die \r\ngegen  das  ungeheure  Leben!  Nun  gehabt  euch  wohl! \r\nReisen  lern  ich  wohl  auf  dieser  Reise;  ob  ich  leben  lerne, \r\nweiß  ich  nicht.  Die  Menschen,  die  es  zu  verstehen  schei- \r\nnen, sind  in  Art  und  Wesen  zu  sehr  von  mir  verschieden, \r\nals  daß  ich  auf  dieses  Talent  sollte  Anspruch  machen \r\nkönnen. \r\n\r\nLebet  wohl  und  liebt  mich,  wie  ich  eurer  von  Herzen  ge- \r\ndenke. \r\n\r\nDen  28.  März. \r\nDiese  Tage  gehen  mir  nun  gänzlich  mit  Einpacken  und \r\nAbschiednehmen,  mit  Besorgen  und  Bezahlen,  Nachholen \r\nund  Vorbereiten,  sie  srehen  mir  völlitr  verloren. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  237 \r\n\r\nDer  Fürst  von  Waldeck  beunruhigte  mich  noch  beim  Ab- \r\nschied: denn  er  sprach  von  nichts  weniger,  als  daß  ich \r\nbei  meiner  Rückkehr  mich  einrichten  sollte,  mit  ihm  nach \r\nGriechenland  und  Dalmatien  zu  gehen.  Wenn  man  sich \r\neinmal  in  die  Welt  macht  und  sich  mit  der  Welt  einläßt, \r\nso  mag  man  sich  ja  hüten,  daß  man  nicht  entrückt  oder \r\nwohl  gar  verrückt  wird.  Zu  keiner  Silbe  weiter  bin  ich \r\nfähig. \r\n\r\nNeapel^  den  2g.  März. \r\n\r\nSeit  einigen  Tagen  machte  sich  das  Wetter  ungewiß, \r\nheute,  am  bestimmten  Tage  der  Abfalirt,  ist  es  so  schön \r\nals  möglich.  Die  günstigste  Tramontane,  ein  klarer  Son- \r\nnenhimm^el,  unter  dem  man  sich  in  die  weite  Welt \r\nwünscht.  Nun  sag  ich  noch  allen  Freunden  in  Weimar \r\nund  Gotha  ein  treues  Lebewohl!  Eure  Liebe  begleite \r\nmich,  denn  ich  möchte  ihrer  wohl  immer  bedürfen.  Heute \r\nnacht  träumte  ich  mich  wieder  in  meinen  Geschäften. \r\nEs  ist  denn  doch,  als  wenn  ich  mein  FasanenschifF  nir- \r\ngends als  bei  euch  ausladen  könnte.  Möge  es  .nur  erst \r\nrecht  stattlich  geladen  sein! \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN \r\n\r\nSeefahrt.,  Donnerstag  den  2g.  März  i'jSy. \r\n\r\nNICHT  wie  bei  dem  letzten  Abgange  des  Paketboots \r\nwehte  diesmal  ein  förderlicher  frischer  Nordost,  son- \r\ndern leider  von  der  Gegenseite  ein  lauer  Südwest,  der  alier- \r\nhinderlichste:  und  so  erfuhren  wir  denn,  wie  der  See- \r\nfahrer vom  Eigensinne  des  Wetters  und  Windes  abhängt. \r\nUngeduldig  verbrachten  wir  den  Morgen  bald  am  Ufer, \r\nbald  im  Kaffeehaus,  endlich  bestiegen  wir  zu  Mittag  das \r\nSchiff  und  genossen  beim  schönsten  Wetter  des  herrlich- \r\nsten Anblicks.  Unfern  vom  Molo  lag  die  Korvette  vor \r\nAnker.  Bei  klarer  Sonne  eine  dunstreiche  Atmosphäre, \r\ndaher  die  beschatteten  Felsenwände  von  Sorrent  vom \r\nschönsten  Blau.  Das  beleuchtete,  lebendige  Neapel  glänzte \r\nvon  allen  Farben.    Erst  mit  Sonnenuntergang  bewegte \r\n\r\n\r\n238  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nsich  das  Schiff\",  jedoch  nur  langsam,  von  der  Stelle;  der \r\nWiderwind  schob  uns  nach  dem  Posilipp  und  dessen  Spitze \r\nhinüber.  Die  ganze  Nacht  ging  das  Schiff\"  ruhig  fort. \r\nEs  war  in  Amerika  gebaut,  schnellsegelnd,  inwendig  mit \r\nartigen  Kämmerchen  und  einzelnen  Lagerstätten  einge- \r\nrichtet. Die  Gesellschaft  anständig  munter:  Operisten \r\nund  Tänzer,  nach  Palermo  verschrieben. \r\n\r\nFräiag,  den  jo.  März. \r\nBei  Tagesanbruch  fanden  wir  uns  zwischen  Ischia  und \r\nCapri,  ohngefähr  von  letzterem  eine  Meile.  Die  Sonne \r\nging  hinter  den  Gebirgen  von  Capri  und  Capo  Minerva \r\nherrlich  auf.  Kniep  zeichnete  fleißig  die  Umrisse  der \r\nKüsten  und  Inseln  und  ihre  verschiedenen  Ansichten;  die \r\nlangsame  Fahrt  kam  seiner  Bemühung  zustatten.  Wir \r\nsetzten  mit  schwachem  und  halbem  Winde  unsern  Weg \r\nfort.  Der  Vesuv  verlor  sich  gegen  vier  Uhr  aus  unsern \r\nAugen,  als  Capo  Minerva  und  Ischia  noch  gesehen  wur- \r\nden. Auch  diese  verloren  sich  gegen  Abend.  Die  Sonne \r\nging  unter  ins  Meer,  begleitet  von  Wolken  und  einem \r\nlangen,  meilenweit  reichenden  Streifen;  alles  purpur- \r\nglänzende Lichter.  Auch  dieses  Phänomen  zeichnete \r\nKniep.  Nun  war  kein  Land  mehr  zu  sehen,  der  Horizont \r\nringsum  ein  Wasserkreis,  die  Nacht  hell  und  schöner \r\nMondschein. \r\n\r\nIch  hatte  doch  dieser  herrlichen  Ansichten  nur  Augen- \r\nblicke genießen  können,  die  Seekrankheit  überfiel  mich \r\nbald.  Ich  begab  mich  in  meine  Kammer,  wählte  die  hori- \r\nzontale Lage,  enthieltmich,  außerweißem  Brot  und  rotem \r\nWein,  aller  Speisen  und  Getränke  und  fühlte  mich  ganz \r\nbehaglich.  Abgeschlossen  von  der  äußern  Welt  ließ  ich \r\ndie  innere  walten,  und  da  eine  langsame  Fahrt  voraus- \r\nzusehen war,  gab  ich  mir  gleich  zu  bedeutender  Unter- \r\nhaltung ein  starkes  Pensum  auf.  Die  zwei  ersten  Akte \r\ndes  Tasso,  in  poetischer  Prosa  geschrieben,  hatte  ich  von \r\nallen  Papieren  allein  mit  über  See  genommen.  Diese \r\nbeiden  Akte,  in  Absicht  auf  Plan  und  Gang  ohngefähr  den \r\ngegenwärtigen  gleich,  aber  schon  vor  zehn  Jahren  ge- \r\nschrieben, hatten  etwas  Weichliches,  Nebelhaftes,  welches \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  239 \r\n\r\nsich  bald  verlor,  als  ich  nach  neueren  Ansichten  die  Form \r\nvorwalten  und  den  Rhythmus  eintreten  ließ. \r\n\r\nSonnabend,  den  ^i.  März. \r\nDie  Sonne  tauchte  klar  aus  dem  Meere  herauf.  Um  sieben \r\nUhr  erreichten  wir  ein  französisches  Schiff,  welches  zwei \r\nTage  vor  uns  abgegangen  war;  um  so  viel  besser  segelten \r\nwir,  und  doch  sahen  wir  noch  nicht  das  Ende  unserer \r\nFahrt.  Einigen  Trost  gab  uns  die  Insel  Ustica,  doch \r\nleider  zur  Linken,  da  wir  sie  eben,  wie  auch  Capri,  hätten \r\nrechts  lassen  sollen.  Gegen  Mittag  war  uns  der  Wind \r\nganz  zuwider,  und  wir  kamen  nicht  von  der  Stelle.  Das \r\nMeer  fing  an,  höher  zu  gehen,  und  im  Schifte  war  fast \r\nalles  krank. \r\n\r\nIch  blieb  in  meiner  gewohnten  Lage,  das  ganze  Stück \r\nward  um  und  um,  durch  und  durch  gedacht.  Die  Stunden \r\ngingen  vorüber,  ohne  daß  ich  ihre  Einteilung  bemerkt \r\nhätte,  wenn  nicht  der  schelmische  Kniep,  auf  dessen \r\nAppetit  die  Wellen  keinen  Einfluß  hatten,  von  Zeit  zu \r\nZeit,  indem  er  mir  Wein  und  Brot  brachte,  die  treffliche \r\nMittagstafel,  die  Heiterkeit  und  Anmut  des  jungen,  tüch- \r\ntigen Kapitäns,  dessen  Bedauern,  daß  ich  meine  Portion \r\nnicht  mitgenieße,  zugleich  schadenfroh  gerühmt  hätte. \r\nEbenso  gab  ihm  der  Übergang  von  Scherz  und  Lust  zu \r\nMißbehagen  und  Krankheit,  und  wie  sich  dieses  bei  ein- \r\nzelnen Gliedern  der  Gesellschaft  gezeigt,  reichen  Stoff \r\nzu  mutwilliger  Schilderung. \r\n\r\nNachmittags  vier  Uhr  gab  der  Kapitän  dem  Schiff  eine \r\nandere  Richtung.  Die  großen  Segel  wurden  wieder  auf- \r\ngezogen und  unsere  Fahrt  gerade  auf  die  Insel  Ustica \r\ngerichtet,  hinter  welcher  wir,  zu  großer  Freude,  die  Berge \r\nvon  Sizilien  erblickten.  Der  Wind  besserte  sich,  wir \r\nfuhren  schneller  auf  Sizilien  los,  auch  kamen  uns  noch \r\neinige  Inseln  zu  Gesichte.  Der  Sonnenuntergang  war \r\ntrübe,  das  Himmelslicht  hinter  Nebel  versteckt.  Den \r\nganzen  Abend  ziemlich  günstiger  Wind.  Gegen  Mitter- \r\nnacht fing  das  Meer  an,  sehr  unruhig  zu  werden. \r\n\r\n\r\n240  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSojDitag^  den  I.  April. \r\nUm  drei  Uhr  morgens  heftiger  Sturm.  Im  Schlaf  und \r\nHalbtraum  setzte  ich  meine  dramatischen  Plane  fort,  in- \r\ndessen auf  dem  Verdeck  große  Bewegung  war.  Die  Segel \r\nmußten  eingenommen  werden,  das  Schiff\"  schwebte  auf \r\nden  hohen  Fluten.  Gegen  Anbruch  des  Tages  legte  sich \r\nder  Sturm,  die  Atmosphäre  klärte  sich  auf.  Nun  lag  die \r\nInsel  Ustica  völlig  links.  Eine  große  Schildkröte  zeigte \r\nman  uns  in  der  Weite  schwimmend,  durch  unsere  Fern- \r\nröhre als  ein  lebendiger  Punkt  wohl  zu  erkennen.  Gegen \r\nMittag  konnten  wir  die  Küste  Siziliens  mit  ihren  Vorge- \r\nbirgen und  Buchten  ganz  deutlich  unterscheiden;  aber  wir \r\nwaren  sehr  unter  den  Wind  gekommen,  wir  lavierten  an \r\nund  ab.  Gegen  Nachmittag  waren  wir  dem  Ufer  näher. \r\nDie  westliche  Küste,  vom  Lilybäischen  Vorgebirge  bis \r\nCapo  Gallo,  sahen  wir  ganz  deutlich,  bei  heiterem  Wetter \r\nund  hell  scheinender  Sonne. \r\n\r\nEine  Gesellschaft  von  Delphinen  begleitete  das  Schiff  an \r\nbeiden  Seiten  des  Vorderteils  und  schössen  immer  voraus. \r\nEs  war  lustig  anzusehen,  wie  sie  bald,  von  den  klaren \r\ndurchscheinenden  Wellen  überdeckt,  hinschwammen,  bald \r\nmit  ihren  Rückenstacheln  und  Floßfedern,  grün-  und \r\ngoldspielenden  Seiten  sich  über  dem  Wasser  springend \r\nbewegten. \r\n\r\nDa  wir  weit  unter  dem  Winde  waren,  fuhr  der  Kapitän \r\ngerade  auf  eine  Bucht  zu,  gleich  hinter  Capo  Gallo. \r\nKniep  versäumte  die  schöne  Gelegenheit  nicht,  die \r\nmannigfaltigsten  Ansichten  ziemlich  im  Detail  zu  zeich- \r\nnen. Mit  Sonnenuntergang  wendete  der  Kapitän  das \r\nSchiff  wieder  dem  hohen  Meer  zu  und  fuhr  nordostwärts, \r\num  die  Höhe  von  Palermo  zu  erreichen.  Ich  wagte  mich \r\nmanchmal  aufs  Verdeck,  doch  ließ  ich  meinen  dichte- \r\nrischen Vorsatz  nicht  aus  dem  Sinne,  und  ich  war  das \r\nganze  Stück  so  ziemlich  Herr  geworden.  Bei  trüblichem \r\nHimmel  heller  Mondschein,  der  Widerschein  auf  dem \r\nMeer  unendlich  schön.  Die  Maler,  um  der\\\\irkung  willen, \r\nlassen  uns  oft  glauben,  der  Widerschein  der  Himmels- \r\nlichter im  Wasser  habe  zunächst  dem  Beschauer  die  größte \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  241 \r\n\r\nBreite,  wo  er  die  größte  Energie  hat.  Hier  aber  sah  man \r\nam  Horizont  den  Widerschein  am  breitsten,  der  sich,  wie \r\neine  zugespitzte  Pyramide,  zunächst  am  Schiff  in  Winken- \r\nden Wellen  endigte.  Der  Kapitän  veränderte  die  Nacht \r\nnoch  einigemal  das  Manöver. \r\n\r\nMontag  den  2.  April,  friih  8  Uhr \r\nfanden  wir  uns  Palermo  gegenüber.  Dieser  Morgen  er- \r\nschien für  mich  höchst  erfreulich.  Der  Plan  meines  Dramas \r\nwar  diese  Tage  her  im  Walfischbauch  ziemlich  gediehen. \r\nIch  befand  mich  wohl  und  konnte  nun  auf  dem  Verdeck \r\ndie  Küsten  Siziliens  mit  Aufmerksamkeit  betrachten. \r\nKniep  zeichnete  emsig  fort^  und  durch  seine  gewandte \r\nGenauigkeit  wurden  mehrere  Streifen  Papier  zu  einem  sehr \r\nschätzbaren  Andenken  dieses  verspäteten  Landens. \r\n\r\nPalermo,  Montag  den  2.  April. \r\nEndlich  gelangten  wir,  mit  Not  und  Anstrengung,  nach- \r\nmittags um  drei  Uhr  in  den  Hafen,  wo  uns  ein  höchst \r\nerfreulicher  Anblick  entgegentrat.  Völlig  hergestellt  wie \r\nich  war,  empfand  ich  das  größte  Vergnügen.  Die  Stadt \r\ngegen  Norden  gekehrt,  am  Fuß  hoher  Berge  liegend;  über \r\nihr,  der  Tageszeit  gemäß,  die  Sonne  herüberscheinend. \r\nDie  klaren  Schattenseiten  aller  Gebäude  sahen  uns  an, \r\nvom  Widerschein  erleuchtet.  Monte  Pellegrino  rechts, \r\nseine  zierlichen  Formen  im  vollkommensten  Lichte,  links \r\ndas  weit  hingestreckte  Ufer  mit  Buchten.  Landzungen  und \r\nVorgebirgen.  Was  ferner  eine  allerliebste  Wirkung  her- \r\nvorbrachte, war  das  junge  Grün  zierlicher  Bäume,  deren \r\nGipfel,  von  hinten  erleuchtet,  wie  große  Massen  vegetabi- \r\nlischer Johanniswürmer  vor  den  dunkeln  Gebäuden  hin \r\nund  wider  wogten.  Ein  klarer  Duft  blaute  alle  Schatten. \r\nAnstatt  ungeduldig  ans  Ufer  zu  eilen,  blieben  wir  auf  dem \r\nVerdeck,  bis  man  uns  wegtrieb;  wo  hätten  wir  einen \r\ngleichen  Standpunkt,  einen  so  glücklichen  Augenblick  so \r\nbald  wieder  hoffen  können ! \r\n\r\nDurch  die  wunderbare,  aus  zwei  Ungeheuern  Pfeilern  be- \r\nstehende Pforte,  die  oben  nicht  geschlossen  sein  darf, \r\ndamit  der  turmhohe  Wagen  der  heiligen  Rosalia  an  dem \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  16 \r\n\r\n\r\n242  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  n \r\n\r\nberühmten  Feste  durchfahren  könne,  führte  man  uns  in \r\ndie  Stadt  und  sogleich  links  in  einen  großen  Gasthof.  Der \r\nWirt,  ein  alter  behaglicher  Mann,  von  jeher  Fremde  aller \r\nNationen  zu  sehen  gewohnt,  führte  uns  in  ein  großes \r\nZimmer,  von  dessen  Balkon  wir  das  Meer  und  die  Reede, \r\nden  Rosalienberg  und  das  Ufer  überschauten,  auch  unser \r\nSchiff  erblickten  und  unsern  ersten  Standpunkt  beurteilen \r\nkonnten.  Über  die  Lage  unseres  Zimmers  höchst  vergnügt, \r\nbemerkten  wir  kaum,  daß  im  Grunde  desselben  ein  er- \r\nhöhter Alkoven  hinter  Vorhängen  versteckt  sei,  wo  sich \r\ndas  weitläuftigste  Bett  ausbreitete,  das,  mit  einem  seidenen \r\nThronhimmel  prangend,  mit  den  übrigen  veralteten  statt- \r\nlichen Mobilien  völlig  übereinstimmte.  Ein  solches  Prunk- \r\ngemach setzte  uns  gewissermaßen  in  Verlegenheit,  wir  ver- \r\nlangten herkommlicherweise  Bedingungen  abzuschließen. \r\nDer  Alte  sagte  dagegen,  es  bedürfe  keiner  Bedingung;  er \r\nwünsche,  daß  es  uns  bei  ihm  wohl  gefalle;  wir  sollten \r\nuns  auch  des  Vorsaals  bedienen,  welcher,  kühl  und  luftig, \r\ndurch  mehrere  Balkone  lustig,  ■  gleich  an  unser  Zimmer \r\nstieß. \r\n\r\nWir  vergnügten  uns  an  der  unendlich  mannigfaltigen  Aus- \r\nsicht und  suchten  sie  im  einzelnen  zeichnerisch  und \r\nmalerisch  zu  entwickeln^  denn  hier  konnte  man  grenzen- \r\nlos eine  Ernte  für  den  Künstler  überschauen. \r\nDer  helle  Mondschein  lockte  uns  des  Abends  noch  auf \r\ndie  Reede  und  hielt  nach  der  Rückkehr  uns  noch  eine \r\nlange  Zeit  auf  dem  Altan.  Die  Beleuchtung  war  sonder- \r\nbar, Ruhe  und  .\\nmut  groß. \r\n\r\nPalermo^  Dienstag  den  3.  April. \r\nUnser  erstes  war,  die  Stadt  näher  zu  betrachten,  die  sehr \r\nleicht  zu  überschauen  und  .schwer  zu  kennen  ist:  leicht, \r\nweil  eine  meilenlange  Straße  vom  untern  zum  obern  Tor, \r\nvom  Meere  bis  gegen  das  Gebirg,  sie  durchschneidet  und \r\ndiese  ohngefähr  in  der  Mitte  von  einer  andern  abermals \r\ndurchschnitten  wird;  was  auf  diesen  Linien  liegt,  ist  be- \r\nquem zu  finden,  das  Innere  der  Stadt  hingegen  verwirrt \r\nden  Fremden,  und  er  entwirrt  sich  nur  mit  Hilfe  eines \r\nFührers  diesem  Labyrinthe. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  243 \r\n\r\nGegen  Abend  schenkten  wir  unsere  Aufmerksamkeit  der \r\nKutschenreihe,  der  bekannten  Fahrt  vornehmerer  Per- \r\nsonen, welche  sich  zur  Stadt  hinaus  auf  die  Reede  be- \r\ngaben, um  frische  Luft  zu  schöpfen,  sich  zu  unterhalten \r\nund  allenfalls  zu  courtoisieren. \r\n\r\nZwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht  war  der  Vollmond  eingetreten \r\nund  verherrlichte  den  Abend  unaussprechlich.  Die  Lage \r\nvon  Palermo  gegen  Norden  macht,  daß  sich  Stadt  und \r\nUfer  sehr  wundersam  gegen  die  großen  Himmelslichter \r\nverhält,  deren  Widerschein  man  niemals  in  den  Wellen \r\nerblickt.  Deswegen  wir  auch  heute,  an  dem  heitersten \r\nTage,  das  Meer  dunkelblau,  ernsthaft  und  zudringlich \r\nfanden,  anstatt  daß  es  bei  Neapel  von  der  Mittagsstunde \r\nan  immer  heiterer,  luftiger  und  ferner  glänzt. \r\nKniep  hatte  mich  schon  heute  manchen  Weg  und  manche \r\nBetrachtung  allein  machen  lassen,  um  einen  genauen \r\nKontur  des  Monte  Pellegrino  zu  nehmen,  des  schönsten \r\naller  Vorgebirge  der  Welt, \r\n\r\nHier  noch  einiges  zusammenfassend,  nachträglich  und \r\nvertraulich. \r\n\r\nWir  fuhren  Donnerstag  den  29.  März  mit  Sonnenunter- \r\ngang von  Neapel  und  landeten  erst  nach  vier  Tagen  um \r\ndrei  Uhr  im  Hafen  von  Palermo.  Ein  kleines  Diarium, \r\ndas  ich  beilege,  erzählt  überhaupt  unsere  Schicksale. \r\nIch  habe  nie  eine  Reise  so  ruhig  angetreten  als  diese, \r\nhabe  nie  eine  ruhigere  Zeit  gehabt  als  auf  der  durch  be- \r\nständigen Gegenwind  sehr  verlängerten  Fahrt,  selbst  auf \r\ndem  Bette  im  engen  Kämmerchen,  wo  ich  mich  die  ersten \r\nTage  halten  mußte,  weil  mich  die  Seekrankheit  stark \r\nangriff.  Nun  denke  ich  ruhig  zu  euch  hinüber;  denn \r\nwenn  irgend  etwas  für  mich  entscheidend  war,  so  ist  es \r\ndiese  Reise. \r\n\r\nHat  man  sich  nicht  ringsum  vom  Meere  umgeben  ge- \r\nsehen, so  hat  man  keinen  Begriff  von  Welt  und  von  seinem \r\nVerhältnis  zur  Welt.  Als  Landschaftszeichner  hat  mir \r\ndiese  große  simple  Linie  ganz  neue  Gedanken  gegeben. \r\nWir  haben,  wie  das  Diarium  ausweist,  auf  dieser  kurzen \r\nFahrt    mancherlei    Abwechslungen    und,  gleichsam    die \r\n\r\n\r\n2  44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSchicksale  der  Seefahrer  im  kleinen  gehabt.  Übrigens \r\nist  die  Sicherheit  und  Bequemlichkeit  des  Paketboots \r\nnicht  genug  zu  loben.  Der  Kapitän  ist  ein  sehr  braver \r\nund  recht  artiger  Mann.  Die  Gesellschaft  war  ein  ganzes \r\nTheater,  gut  gesittet,  leidlich  und  angenehm.  Mein  Künst- \r\nler, den  ich  bei  mir  habe,  ist  ein  munterer,  treuer,  guter \r\nMensch,  der  mit  der  größten  Akkuratesse  zeichnet;  er  hat \r\nalle  Inseln  und  Küsten,  wie  sie  sich  zeigten,  umrissen; \r\nes  wird  euch  große  Freude  machen,  wenn  ich  alles  mit- \r\nbringe. Übrigens  hat  er  mir,  die  langen  Stunden  der \r\nÜberfahrt  zu  verkürzen,  das  Mechanische  der  Wasser- \r\nfarbenmalerei (Aquarell),  die  man  in  Italien  jetzt  sehr \r\nhoch  getrieben  hat,  aufgeschrieben;  versteht  sich  den \r\nGebrauch  gewisser  Farben,  um  gewisse  Töne  hervorzu- \r\nbringen, an  denen  man  sich,  ohne  das  Geheimnis  zu \r\nwissen,  zu  Tode  mischen  würde.  Ich  hatte  wohl  in  Rom \r\nmanches  davon  erfahren,  aber  niemals  im  Zusammen- \r\nhange. Die  Künstler  haben  es  in  einem  Lande  ausstudiert, \r\nwie  Italien,  wie  dieses  ist.  Mit  keinen  Worten  ist  die \r\ndunstige  Klarheit  auszudrücken,  die  um  die  Küsten \r\nschwebte,  als  wir  am  schönsten  Nachmittage  gegen  Pa- \r\nlermo anfuhren.  Die  Reinheit  der  Konture,  die  Weichheit \r\ndes  Ganzen,  das  Auseinanderweichen  der  Töne,  die  Har- \r\nmonie von  Himmel,  Meer  und  Erde.  Wer  es  gesehen  hat, \r\nder  hat  es  auf  sein  ganzes  Leben.  Nun  versteh  ich  erst  die \r\nClaude  Lorrain  und  habe  Hoffnung,  auch  dereinst  in \r\nNorden  aus  meiner  Seele  Schattenbilder  dieser  glück- \r\nlichen Wohnung  hervorzubringen.  Wäre  nur  alles  Klein- \r\nliche so  rein  daraus  weggewaschen  als  die  Kleinheit  der \r\nStrohdächer  aus  meinen  Zeichenbegriffen.  Wir  wollen \r\nsehen,  was  diese  Königin  der  Inseln  tun  kann. \r\nWie  sie  uns  empfangen  hat,  habe  ich  keine  Worte  aus- \r\nzudrücken: mit  frisch  grünenden  Maulbeerbäumen,  immer \r\ngrünendem  Oleander,  Zitronenhecken  usw.  In  einem \r\nöffentlichen  Garten  stehn  weite  Beete  von  Ranunkeln \r\nund  Anemonen.  Die  Luft  ist  mild,  warm  und  wohlriechend, \r\nder  Wind  lau.  Der  Mond  ging  dazu  voll  hinter  einem \r\nVorgebirge  herauf  und  schien  ins  Meer;  und  die.sen  Ge- \r\nnuß, nachdem  man  vier  Tage  und  Nächte  auf  den  Wellen \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  245 \r\n\r\ngeschwebt!  Verzeiht,  wenn  ich  mit  einer  stumpfen  Feder \r\naus  einer  Tuschmuschel,  aus  der  mein  Gefährte  die  Um- \r\nrisse nachzieht,  dieses  hinkritzle.  Es  kommt  doch  wie \r\nein  Lispeln  zu  euch  hinüber,  indes  ich  allen,  die  mich \r\nlieben,  ein  ander  Denkmal  dieser  meiner  glücklichen \r\nStunden  bereite.  Was  es  wird,  sag  ich  nicht;  wenn  ihr \r\nes  erhaltet,  kann  ich  auch  nicht  sagen. \r\n\r\nDieses  Blatt  sollte  nun,  meine  Geliebten,  euch  des \r\nschönsten  Genusses,  insofern  es  möglich  wäre,  teilhaft \r\nmachen;  es  sollte  die  Schilderung  der  unvergleichlichen, \r\neine  große  Wassermasse  umfassenden  Bucht  überliefern. \r\nVon  Osten  herauf,  wo  ein  flacheres  Vorgebirg  weit  in \r\ndie  See  gi'eift,  an  vielen  schroffen,  wohlgebildeten,  wald- \r\nbewachsenen Felsen  hin  bis  an  die  P'ischerwohnungen \r\nder  Vorstädte  herauf,  dann  an  der  Stadt  selbst  her,  deren \r\näußere  Häuser  alle  nach  dem  Hafen  schauen,  wie  unsere \r\nWohnung  auch,  bis  zu  dem  Tore,  durch  welches  wir \r\nhereinkamen.  Dann  geht  es  westwärts  weiter  fort  an \r\nden  gewöhnlichen  Landungsplatz,  wo  kleinere  Schiffe  an- \r\nlegen, bis  zu  dem  eigentlichen  Hafen  an  den  Molo,  die \r\nStation  größerer  Schifte.  Da  erhebt  sich  nun,  sämtliche \r\nFahrzeuge  zu  schützen,  in  Westen  der  Monte  Pellegrino \r\nin  seinen  schönen  Formen,  nachdem  er  ein  liebliches, \r\nfruchtbares  Tal,  das  sich  bis  zum  jenseitigen  Meer  er- \r\nstreckt, zwischen  sich  und  dem  eigentlichen  festen  Land \r\ngelassen. \r\n\r\nKniep  zeichnete,  ich  schematisierte,  beide  mit  großem \r\nGenuß,  und  nun,  da  wir  fröhlich  nach  Hause  kommen, \r\nfühlen  wir  beide  weder  Kräfte  noch  Mut,  zu  wiederholen \r\nund  auszuführen.  Unsere  Entwürfe  müssen  also  für  künf- \r\ntige Zeiten  liegen  bleiben,  und  dieses  Blatt  gibt  euch \r\nbloß  ein  Zeugnis  unseres  Unverrnögens,  diese  Gegen- \r\nstände genugsam  zu  fassen,  oder  vielmehr  unserer  An- \r\nmaßung, sie  in  so  kurzer  Zeit  erobern  und  beherrschen \r\nzu  wollen. \r\n\r\nAlithvoch  den  4.  April. \r\nNachmittags  besuchten  wir  das  fruchtreiche  und  ange- \r\n\r\n\r\n246  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nnehme  Tal,  welches  die  südlichen  Berge  herab  an  Palermo \r\nvorbeizieht,  durchschlängelt  von  dem  Fluß  Oreto.  Auch \r\nhier  wird  ein  malerisches  Auge  und  eine  geschickte  Hand \r\ngefordert,  wenn  ein  Bild  soll  gefunden  werden;  und  doch \r\nerhaschte  Kniep  einen  Standpunkt,  da,  wo  das  gestemmte \r\nWasser  von  einem  halbzerstörten  Wehr  herunterfließt,  be- \r\nschattet von  einer  fröhlichen  Baumgruppe,  dahinter,  das \r\nTal  hinaufwärts,  die  freie  Aussicht  und  einige  landwirt- \r\nschaftliche Gebäude. \r\n\r\nDie  schönste  Frühlingswitterung  und  eine  hervorquellende \r\nFruchtbarkeit  verbreitete  das  Gefühl  eines  belebenden \r\nFriedens  über  das  ganze  Tal,  welches  mir  der  ungeschickte \r\nFührer  durch  seine  Gelehrsamkeit  verkümmerte,  umständ- \r\nlich erzählend,  wie  Hannibal  hier  vormals  eine  Schlacht \r\ngeliefert  und  was  für  ungeheure  Kriegstaten  an  dieser \r\nStelle  geschehen.  Unfreundlich  verwies  ich  ihm  das  fatale \r\nHervorrufen  solcher  abgeschiedenen  Gespenster.  Es  sei \r\nschlimm  genug,  meinte  ich,  daß  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  die \r\nSaaten,  wo  nicht  immer  von  Elefanten,  doch  von  Pferden \r\nund  Menschen  zerstampft  werden  müßten.  Man  solle \r\nwenigstens  die  Einbildungskraft  nicht  mit  solchem  Nach- \r\ngetümmel aus  ihrem  friedlichen  Traume  aufschrecken. \r\nEr  verwunderte  sich  sehr,  daß  ich  das  klassische  Anden- \r\nken an  so  einer  Stelle  verschmähte,  und  ich  konnte  ihm \r\nfreilich  nicht  deutlich  machen,  wie  mir  bei  einer  solchen \r\nVermischung  des  Vergangenen  und  des  Gegenwärtigen \r\nzumute  sei. \r\n\r\nNoch  wunderlicher  erschien  ich  diesem  Begleiter,  als  ich \r\nauf  allen  seichten  Stellen,  deren  der  Fluß  gar  viele  trocken \r\nläßt,  nach  Steinchen  suchte  und  die  verschiedenen  Arten \r\nderselben  mit  mir  forttrug.  Ich  konnte  ihm  abermals \r\nnicht  erklären,  daß  man  sich  von  einer  gebirgigen  Gegend \r\nnicht  schneller  einen  Bcgrift'  machen  kann,  als  wenn  man \r\ndie  Gesteinarten  untersucht,  die  in  den  Bächen  herab- \r\ngeschoben werden,  und  daß  hier  auch  die  Aufgabe  sei, \r\ndurch  Trümmer  sich  eine  Vorstellung  von  jenen  ewig \r\nklassischen  Höhen  des  Erd-Altertums  zu  verschaffen. \r\nAuch  war  meine  Ausbeute  aus  diesem  Flusse  reich  genug: \r\nich  brachte   beinah   vierzig   Stücke   zusammen,   welche \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  247 \r\n\r\nsich  freilich  in  wenige  Rubriken  unterordnen  ließen.  Das \r\nmeiste  war  eine  Gebirgsart,  die  man  bald  für  Jaspis  oder \r\nHornstein,  bald  für  Tonschiefer  ansprechen  konnte.  Ich \r\nfand  sie  teils  in  abgerundeten,  teils  unförmigen  Geschie- \r\nben, teils  rhombisch  gestaltet,  von  vielerlei  Farben. \r\nFerner  kamen  viele  Abänderungen  des  altern  Kalkes  vor, \r\nnicht  weniger  Breccien,  deren  Bindemittel  Kalk,  die  ver- \r\nbundenen Steine  aber  bald  Jaspis,  bald  Kalk  Avaren.  Auch \r\nfehlte  es  nicht  an  Geschieben  von  Muschelkalk. \r\nDie  Pferde  füttern  sie  mit  Gerste,  Häckerling  und  Kleien; \r\nim  Frühjahr  geben  sie  ihnen  geschoßte  grüne  Gerste,  um \r\nsie  zu  erfrischen,  per  rinfrescar,  wie  sie  es  nennen.  Da \r\nsie  keine  Wiesen  haben,  fehlt  es  an  Heu.  Auf  den  Bergen \r\naribt  es  einige  Weide,  auch  auf  den  Äckern,  da  ein  Drittel \r\nals  Brache  liegen  bleibt.  Sie  halten  wenig  Schafe,  deren \r\nRasse  aus  der  Barbarei  kommt,  überhaupt  auch  mehr \r\nMaultiere  als  Pferde,  weil  jenen  die  hitzige  Nahrung  besser \r\nbekommt  als  diesen. \r\n\r\nDie  Plaine,  worauf  Palermo  liegt,  sowie  außer  der  Stadt \r\ndie  Gegend  Ai  Colli,  auch  ein  Teil  der  Bagaria,  hat  im \r\nGrunde  Muschelkalk,  woraus  die  Stadt  gebaut  ist;  daher \r\nman  denn  auch  große  Steinbrüche  in  diesen  Lagen  findet. \r\nIn  der  Nähe  von  IMonte  Pellegrino  sind  sie  an  einer  Stelle \r\nüber  fünfzig  Fuß  tief.  Die  untern  Lager  sind  weißer  von \r\nFarbe.  ]\\Ian  findet  darin  viel  versteinte  Korallen  und \r\nSchaltiere,  vorzüglich  große  Pilgermuscheln.  Das  obere \r\nLager  ist  mit  rotem  Ton  gemischt  und  enthält  wenig \r\noder  gar  keine  Muscheln.  Ganz  obenauf  liegt  roter  Ton, \r\ndessen  Lage  jedoch  nicht  stark  ist. \r\n\r\nDer  Monte  Pellegrino  hebt  sich  aus  allem  diesen  hervor; \r\ner  ist  ein  älterer  Kalk,  hat  viele  Löcher  und  Spaltungen, \r\nwelche,  genau  betrachtet,  obgleich  sehr  unregelmäßig, \r\nsich  doch  nach  der  Ordnung  der  Bänke  richten.  Das  Ge- \r\nstein ist  fest  und  klingend. \r\n\r\nDonnerstag  den  5.  April. \r\nWir  gingen  die  Stadt  im  besondern  durch.  Die  Bauart \r\ngleicht  meistens  der  von  Neapel,  doch  stehen  öffentliche \r\nMonumente,  zum  Beispiel  Brunnen,  noch  weiter  entfernt \r\n\r\n\r\n2  48  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nvom  guten  Geschmack.  Hier  ist  nicht,  wie  in  Rom,  ein \r\nKunstgeist,  welcher  die  Arbeit  regelt;  nur  von  Zufällig- \r\nkeiten erhält  das  Bauwerk  Gestalt  und  Dasein.  Ein  von \r\ndem  ganzen  Inselvolke  angestaunter  Brunnen  existierte \r\nschwerlich,  wenn  es  in  Sizilien  nicht  schönen  bunten \r\nMarmor  gäbe,  und  wenn  nicht  gerade  ein  Bildhauer,  ge- \r\nübt in  Tiergestalten,  damals  Gunst  gehabt  hätte.  Es  wird \r\nschwer  halten,  diesen  Brunnen  zu  beschreiben.  Auf  einem \r\nmäßigen  Platze  steht  ein  rundes  architektonisches  Werk, \r\nnicht  gar  stockhoch,  Sockel,  Mauer  und  Gesims  von  far- \r\nbigem Marmor;  in  die  Mauer  sind,  in  einer  Flucht, \r\nmehrere  Nischen  angebracht,  aus  welchen,  von  weißem \r\nMarmor  gebildet,  alle  Arten  Tierköpfe  auf  gestreckten \r\nHälsen  herausschauen:  Pferd,  Löwe,  Kamel,  Elefant \r\nwechseln  miteinander  ab,  und  man  erwartete  kaum  hinter \r\ndem  Kreise  dieser  Menagerie  einen  Brunnen,  zu  welchem \r\nvon  vier  Seiten  durch  gelassene  Lücken  marmorne  Stufen \r\nhinaufführen,  um  das  reichlich  gespendete  Wasser  schöpfen \r\nzu  lassen. \r\n\r\nEtwas  Ähnliches  ist  es  mit  den  Kirchen,  wo  die  Pracht - \r\nliebe  der  Jesuiten  noch  überboten  ward,  aber  nicht  aus \r\nGrundsatz  und  Absicht,  sondern  zufällig,  wie  allenfalls \r\nein  gegenwärtiger  Handwerker,  Figuren-  oder  Laub- \r\nschnitzer, Vergolder,  Lackierer  und  Marmorierer  gerade \r\ndas,  was  er  vermochte,  ohne  Geschmack  und  Leitung  an \r\ngewissen  Stellen  anbringen  wollte. \r\n\r\nDabei  findet  man  eine  Fähigkeit,  natürliche  Dinge  nach- \r\nzuahmen, wie  denn  zum  Beispiel  jene  Tierköpfe  gut  genug \r\ngearbeitet  sind.  Dadurch  wird  freilich  die  Bewunderung \r\nder  Menge  erregt,  deren  ganze  Kunstfreude  nur  darin  be- \r\nsteht, daß  sie  das  Nachgebildete  mit  dem  Urbilde  ver- \r\ngleichbar findet. \r\n\r\nGegen  Abend  machte  ich  eine  heitere  Bekanntschaft,  in- \r\ndem ich  auf  der  langen  Straße  bei  einem  kleinen  Han- \r\ndelsmanne  eintrat,  um  verschiedene  Kleinigkeiten  einzu- \r\nkaufen. Als  ich  vor  dem  Laden  stand,  die  Ware  zu  be- \r\nsehen, erhob  sich  ein  geringer  Luftstoß,  welcher,  längs \r\nder  Straße  herwirbelnd,  einen  unendlichen  erregten  Staub \r\nin  alle  Eiuden  und  Fenster  sogleich  verteilte.    Bei  allen \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  249 \r\n\r\nHeiligen!  sagt  mir,  rief  ich  aus,  woher  kommt  die  Unrein- \r\nlichkeit  eurer  Stadt  und  ist  derselben  denn  nicht  abzu- \r\nhelfen? Diese  Straße  wetteifert  an  Lange  und  Schönheit \r\nmit  dem  Corso  zu  Rom.  An  beiden  Seiten  Schrittsteine, \r\ndie  jeder  Laden-  und  Werkstattbesitzer  mit  unablässigem \r\nKehren  reinlich  hält,  indem  er  alles  in  die  Mitte  hinunter- \r\nschiebt, welche  dadurch  nur  immer  unreinlicher  wird  und \r\neuch  mit  jedem  Windshauch  den  Unrat  zurücksendet,  den \r\nilir  der  Hauptstraße  zugewiesen  habt.  In  Neapel  tragen \r\ngeschäftige  Esel  jeden  Tag  das  Kehricht  nach  Gärten \r\nund  Feldern;  sollte  denn  bei  euch  nicht  irgend  eine  ähn- \r\nliche Eim-ichtung  entstehen  oder  getroffen  werden? \r\nEs  ist  bei  uns  nun  einmal,  wie  es  ist,  versetzte  der  Mann; \r\nwas  wir  aus  dem  Hause  werfen,  verfault  gleich  vor  der \r\nTüre  übereinander.  Ihr  seht  hier  Schichten  von  Stroh \r\nund  Rohr,  von  Küchenabgängen  und  allerlei  Unrat;  das \r\ntrocknet  zusammen  auf  und  kehrt  als  Staub  zu  uns  zurück. \r\nGegen  den  wehren  wir  uns  den  ganzen  Tag.  Aber  seht, \r\nunsere  schönen,  geschäftigen,  niedlichen  Besen  ver- \r\nmehren, zuletzt  abgestumpft,  nur  den  Unrat  vor  unsern \r\nHäusern. \r\n\r\nUnd,  lustig  genommen,  war  es  wirklich  an  dem.  Sie \r\nhaben  niedliche  Besehen  von  Zwergpalmen,  die  man  mit \r\nweniger  Abänderung  zum  Fächerdienst  eignen  könnte;  sie \r\nsclileifen  sich  leicht  ab,  und  die  Stumpfen  liegen  zu  Tau- \r\nsenden in  der  Straße.  Auf  meine  wiederholte  Frage,  ob \r\ndagegen  keine  Anstalt  zu  treffen  sei,  erwiderte  er,  die \r\nRede  gehe  im  Volke,  daß  gerade  die,  welche  für  Rein- \r\nlichkeit zu  sorgen  hätten,  wegen  ihres  großen  Einflusses \r\nnicht  genötigt  werden  könnten,  die  Gelder  pflichtmäßig \r\nzu  verwenden,  und  dabei  sei  noch  der  wunderliche  Um- \r\nstand, daß  man  fürchte,  nach  weggeschafitem  misthaften \r\nGeströhde  werde  erst  deutlich  zum  Vorschein  kommen, \r\nwie  schlecht  das  Pflaster  darunter  beschafien  sei,  wodurch \r\ndenn  abermals  die  unredliche  Verwaltung  einer  andern \r\nKasse  zutage  kommen  würde.  Das  alles  aber  sei,  setzte \r\ner  mit  possierlichem  Ausdruck  hinzu,  nur  Auslegung  von \r\nÜbelgesinnten.  erabervonderMeinungderjenigen,  welche \r\nbehaupten,  der  Adel  erhalte  seinen  Karossen  diese  weiche \r\n\r\n\r\n250  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nUnterlage,  damit  sie  des  Al)ends  ilire  herkömmliche  Lust- \r\nfahrt auf  elastischem  Boden  bequem  vollbringen  könnten. \r\nUnd  da  der  Mann  einmal  im  Zuge  war,  bescherzte  er \r\nnoch  mehrere  Polizeimißbräuche,  mir  zu  tröstlichem  Be- \r\nweis, daß  der  Mensch  noch  immer  Humor  genug  hat, \r\nsich  über  das  Unabwendbare  lustig  zu  machen. \r\n\r\nDen  6.  April. \r\n\r\nDie  heilige  Rosalie,  Schutzpatronin  von  Palermo,  ist  durch \r\ndie  Beschreibung,  welche  Brydone  von  ihrem  Feste  ge- \r\ngeben hat,  so  allgemein  bekannt  geworden,  daß  es  den \r\nFreunden  gewiß  angenehm  sein  muß,  etwas  von  dem \r\nOrte  und  der  Stelle^  wo  sie  besonders  verehrt  wird,  zu \r\nlesen. \r\n\r\nDer  Monte  Pellegrino,  eine  große  Felsenmasse,  breiter \r\nals  hoch,  liegt  an  dem  nordwestlichen  Ende  des  Golfs \r\nvon  Palermo.  Seine  schöne  Fonii  läßt  sich  mit  Worten \r\nnicht  beschreiben;  eine  unvollkommene  Abbildung  davon \r\nfindet  sich  in  dem  Voyage  pittoresque  de  la  Sicile.  Er \r\nbesteht  aus  einem  grauen  Kalkstein  der  früheren  Epoche. \r\nDie  Felsen  sind  ganz  nackt;  kein  Baum,  kein  Strauch \r\nwächst  auf  ihnen,  kaum  daß  die  flachliegenden  Teile  mit \r\netwas  Rasen  und  Moos  bedeckt  sind. \r\nIn  einer  Höhle  dieses  Berges  entdeckte  man  zu  Anfang \r\ndes  vorigen  Jahrhunderts  die  Gebeine  der  Heiligen  und \r\nbrachte  sie  nach  Palermo.  Ihre  Gegenwart  befreite  die \r\nStadt  von  der  Pest,  und  Rosalie  war  seit  diesem  Augen- \r\nblicke die  Schutzheilige  des  Volks;  man  baute  ihr  Kapellen \r\nund  stellte  ihr  zu  Ehren  glänzende  Feierlichkeiten  an. \r\nDie  Andächtigen  wallfahrteten  fleißig  auf  den  Berg,  und \r\nman  erbaute  mit  großen  Kosten  einen  Weg,  der,  wie  eine \r\nWasserleitung,  auf  Pfeilern  und  Bogen  ruht  und  in  einem \r\nZickzack  zwischen  zwei  Klippen  hinaufsteigt. \r\nDer  Andachtsort  selbst  ist  der  Demut  der  Heiligen,  welche \r\nsich  dahin  flüchtete,  angemessener  als  die  prächtigen \r\nFeste,  welche  man  ihrer  völligen  Entäußerung  von  der \r\nWelt  zu  Ehren  anstellte.  Und  vielleicht  hat  die  ganze \r\nChristenheit,   welche   nun   achtzehnhundert  Jahre   ihren \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  251 \r\n\r\nBesitz,  ihre  Pracht,  ihre  feierlichen  Lustbarkeiten  auf  das \r\nElend  ihrer  ersten  Stifter  und  eifrigsten  Bekenner  gründet, \r\nkeinen  heiligen  Ort  aufzuweisen,  der  auf  eine  so  unschul- \r\ndige und  gefühlvolle  Art  verziert  und  verehrt  wäre. \r\nWenn  man  den  Berg  erstiegen  hat,  wendet  man  sich  um \r\neine  Felsenecke,  wo  man  einer  steilen  Felswand  nah \r\ngegenübersteht,  an  welcher  die  Kirche  und  das  Kloster \r\ngleichsam  festgebaut  sind. \r\n\r\nDie  Außenseite  der  Kirche  hat  nichts  Einladendes  noch \r\nVersprechendes;  man  eröffnet  die  Türe  ohne  Erwartung, \r\nwird  aber  auf  das  wunderbarste  überrascht,  indem  man \r\nhineintritt.  Man  befindet  sich  unter  einer  Halle,  welche \r\nin  der  Breite  der  Kirche  hinläuft  und  gegen  das  Schiff \r\nzu  offen  ist.  Man  sieht  in  derselben  die  gewöhnlichen \r\nGefäße  mit  Weihwasser  und  einige  Beichtstühle.  Das \r\nSchiff  der  Kirche  ist  ein  offner  Hof,  der  an  der  rechten \r\nSeite  von  rauhen  Felsen,  auf  der  linken  von  einer  Kon- \r\ntinuation  der  Halle  zugeschlossen  wird.  Er  ist  mit  Stein- \r\nplatten etwas  abhängig  belegt,  damit  das  Regenwasser \r\nablaufen  kann;  ein  kleiner  Brunnen  steht  ohngefähr  in  der \r\nMitte. \r\n\r\nDie  Höhle  selbst  ist  zum  Chor  umgebildet,  ohne  daß  man \r\nihr  von  der  natürlichen  rauhen  Gestalt  etwas  genommen \r\nhätte.  Einige  Stufen  führen  hinauf:  gleich  steht  der  große \r\nPult  mit  dem  Chorbuche  entgegen,  auf  beiden  Seiten \r\ndie  Chorstühle.  Alles  wird  von  dem  aus  dem  Hofe  oder \r\nSchiff  einfallenden  Tageslicht  erleuchtet.  Tief  hinten,  in \r\ndem  Dunkel  der  Höhle,  steht  der  Hauptaltar  in  der \r\nMitte. \r\n\r\nMan  hat,  wie  schon  gesagt,  an  der  Höhle  nichts  ver- \r\nändert; allein  da  die  Felsen  immer  von  Wasser  träufeln, \r\nwar  es  nötig,  den  Ort  trocken  zu  halten.  Man  hat  dieses \r\ndurch  bleierne  Rinnen  bewirkt,  welche  man  an  den  Kan- \r\nten der  Felsen  hergeführt  und  verschiedentlich  mitein- \r\nander verbunden  hat.  Da  sie  oben  breit  sind  und  unten \r\nspitz  zulaufen,  auch  mit  einer  schmutzig -grünen  Parbe \r\nangestrichen  sind,  so  sieht  es  fast  aus,  als  wenn  die  Höhle \r\ninwendig  mit  großen  Kaktusarten  bewachsen  wäre.  Das \r\nWasser  wird  teils  seitwärts,  teils  hinten  in  einen  klaren \r\n\r\n\r\n2  5  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nBehälter  geleitet,  woraus  es  die  Gläubigen  schöpfen  und \r\ngegen  allerlei  Übel  gebrauchen. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  diese  Gegenstände  genau  betrachtete,  trat  ein \r\nGeistlicher  zu  mir  und  fragte  mich,  ob  ich  etwa  ein  Ge- \r\nnueser  sei  und  einige  Messen  wollte  lesen  lassen.  Ich \r\nversetzte  ihm  darauf,  ich  sei  mit  einem  Genueser  nach \r\nPalermo  gekommen,  welcher  morgen,  als  an  einem  Fest- \r\ntage, heraufsteigen  würde.  Da  immer  einer  von  uns  zu \r\nHause  bleiben  müßte,  wäre  ich  heute  heraufgegangen, \r\nmich  umzusehen.  Er  versetzte  darauf,  ich  möchte  mich \r\naller  Freiheit  bedienen,  alles  wohl  betrachten  und  meine \r\nDevotion  verrichten.  Besonders  wies  er  mich  an  einen \r\nAltar,  der  links  in  der  Höhle  stund,  als  ein  besonderes \r\nHeiligtum,  und  verließ  mich. \r\n\r\nIch  sah  durch  die  Öffnungen  eines  großen,  aus  Messing \r\ngeti-iebenen  Laubwerks  Lampen  unter  dem  Altar  hervor- \r\nschimmern, kniete  ganz  nahe  davor  hin  und  blickte  durch \r\ndie  Öftnungen.  Es  war  inwendig  noch  ein  Gitterwerk  von \r\nfeinem  geflochtenen  Messingdraht  vorgezogen,  so  daß \r\nman  nur  wie  durch  einen  Flor  den  Gegenstand  dahinter \r\nunterscheiden  konnte.  —  Ein  schönes  Frauenzimmer  er- \r\nblickt ich  bei  dem  Schein  einiger  stillen  Lampen. \r\nSie  lag  wie  in  einer  Art  von  Entzückung,  die  Augen  halb \r\ngeschlossen,  den  Kopf  nachlässig  auf  die  rechte  Hand \r\ngelegt,  die  mit  vielen  Ringen  geschmückt  war.  Ich  konnte \r\ndas  Bild  nicht  genug  betrachten;  es  schien  mir  ganz  be- \r\nsondere Reize  zu  haben.  Ihr  Gewand  ist  aus  einem  ver- \r\ngoldeten Blech  getrieben,  welches  einen  reich  von  Gold \r\ngewirkten  Stoff  gar  gut  nachahmt.  Kopf  und  Hände  von \r\nweißem  Marmor  sind,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  in  einem  hohen \r\nStil,  aber  doch  so  natürlich  und  getallig  gearbeitet,  daß \r\nman  glaubt,  sie  müßte  Atem  holen  und  sich  bewegen. \r\nEin  kleiner  Engel  steht  neben  ihr  und  scheint  ihr  mit \r\neinem  Lilienstengel  Kühlung  zuzuwehen. \r\nUnterdessen  waren  die  Geistlichen  in  die  Höhle  gekom- \r\nmen, hatten  sich  auf  ihre  Stühle  gesetzt  und  sangen  die \r\nVesper. \r\n\r\nIch  setzte  mich  auf  eine  Bank,  gegen  dem  Altar  über, \r\nund  hörte  ihnen  eine  Weile  zu;    alsdann  begab  ich  mich \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  253 \r\n\r\nwieder  zum  Altare,  kniete  nieder  und  suchte  das  schöne \r\nBild  der  Heiligen  noch  deutlicher  gewahr  zu  werden.  Ich \r\nüberließ  mich  ganz  der  reizenden  Illusion  der  Gestalt  und \r\ndes  Ortes. \r\n\r\nDer  Gesang  der  Geistlichen  verklang  nun  in  der  Höhle, \r\ndas  Wasser  rieselte  in  das  Behältnis  gleich  neben  dem \r\nAltare  zusammen,  die  überhangenden  Felsen  des  Vorhofs, \r\ndes  eigentlichen  Schiffs  der  Kirche,  schlössen  die  Szene \r\nnoch  mehr  ein.  Es  w^ar  eine  große  Stille  in  dieser  gleich- \r\nsam wieder  ausgestorbenen  Wüste;  eine  große  Reinlich- \r\nkeit in  einer  wilden  Höhle;  der  Flitterputz  des  katholi- \r\nschen, besonders  sizilianischen  Gottesdienstes  hier  noch \r\nzunächst  seiner  natürlichen  Einfalt;  die  Illusion,  welche \r\ndie  Gestalt  der  schönen  Schläferin  hervorbrachte,  auch \r\neinem  geübten  Auge  noch  reizend — genug,  ich  konnte \r\nmich  nur  mit  Schwierigkeit  von  diesem  Orte  losreißen  und \r\nkam  erst  in  später  Nacht  wieder  in  Palermo  an. \r\n\r\nScvuiabeiui  den  y.  April. \r\nIn  dem  öffentlichen  Garten,  unmittelbar  an  der  Reede, \r\nbrachte  ich  im  stillen  die  vergnügtesten  Stunden  zu.  Es \r\nist  der  wunderbarste  Ort  von  der  Welt.  Regelmäßig  an- \r\ngelegt, scheint  er  uns  doch  feenhaft;  vor  nicht  gar  langer \r\nZeit  gepflanzt,  versetzt  er  ins  Altertum.  Grüne  Beetein- \r\nfassungen umschließen  fremde  Gewächse;  Zitronenspaliere \r\nwölben  sich  zum  niedlichen  Laubengange;  hohe  Wände \r\ndes  Oleanders,  geschmückt  von  tausend  roten  nelken- \r\nhaften  Blüten,  locken  das  Auge.  Ganz  fremde,  mir  un- \r\nbekannte Bäume,  noch  ohne  Laub,  wahrscheinlich  aus \r\nwarmem  Gegenden,  verbreiten  seltsame  Zweige.  Eine \r\nhinter  dem  flachen  Raum  erhöhte  Bank  läßt  einen  so \r\nwundersam  verschlungenen  Wachstum  übersehen  und \r\nlenkt  den  Blick  zuletzt  auf  große  Bassins,  in  welchen \r\nGold-  und  Silberfische  sich  gar  lieblich  bewegen,  bald \r\nsich  unter  bemooste  Röhren  verbergen,  bald  wieder \r\nscharenweis,  durch  einen  Bissen  Brot  gelockt,  sich  ver- \r\nsammeln. An  den  Pflanzen  erscheint  durchaus  ein  Grün, \r\ndas  wir  nicht  gewohnt  sind,  bald  gelblicher,  bald  blau- \r\nlicher als  bei  uns.    Was  aber  dem  Ganzen  die  wunder- \r\n\r\n\r\n2  54  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nsamste  Anmut  verlieh,  war  ein  starker  Duft,  der  sich  über \r\nalles  gleichförmig  verbreitete,  mit  so  merklicher  Wirkung, \r\ndaß  die  Gegenstände,  auch  nur  einige  Schritte  hinter- \r\neinander entfernt,  sich  entschiedener  hellblau  voneinander \r\nabsetzten,  so  daß  ihre  eigentümliche  Farbe  zuletzt  ver- \r\nloren ging  oder  wenigstens  sehr  überbläut  sie  sich  dem \r\nAuge  darstellten. \r\n\r\nWelche  wundersame  Ansicht  ein  solcher  Duft  entferntem \r\nGegenständen,  Schiften,  Vorgebirgen  erteilt,  ist  für  ein \r\nmalerisches  Auge  merkwürdig  genug,  indem  die  Distanzen \r\ngenau  zu  unterscheiden,  ja  zu  messen  sind;  deswegen  auch \r\nein  Spaziergang  auf  die  Höhe  höchst  reizend  ward.  Man \r\nsah  keine  Natur  mehr,  sondern  nur  Bilder,  wie  sie  der \r\nkünstlichste  Maler  durch  Lasieren  auseinander  gestuft \r\nhätte. \r\n\r\nAber  der  Eindruck  jenes  Wimdergartens  war  mir  zu  tief \r\ngeblieben;  die  schwärzlichen  Wellen  am  nördlichen  Hori- \r\nzonte, ihr  Anstreben  an  die  Buchtkrümmungen,  selbst \r\nder  eigene  Geruch  des  dünstenden  Meeres,  das  alles  rief \r\nmir  die  Insel  der  seligen  Phäaken  in  die  Sinne  sowie  ins \r\nGedächtnis.  Ich  eilte  sogleich,  einen  Homer  zu  kaufen, \r\njenen  Gesang  mit  großer  Erbauung  zu  lesen  und  eine \r\nÜbersetzung  aus  dem  Stegreif  Kniepen  vorzutragen,  der \r\nwohl  verdiente,  bei  einem  guten  Glase  Wein  von  seinen \r\nstrengen  heutigen  Bemühungen  behaglich  auszuruhen. \r\n\r\nDen  8.  April.  Ostersotmtag. \r\nNun  aber  ging  die  lärmige  Freude  über  die  glückliche \r\nAuferstehung  des  Herrn  mit  Tagesanbruch  los.  Petarden, \r\nLauffeuer,  Schläge,  Schwärmer  und  dergleichen  wurden \r\nkastenweis  vor  den  Kirchtüren  losgebrannt,  indessen  die \r\nGläubigen  sich  zu  den  eröftheten  Flügelpforten  drängten. \r\nGlocken-  und  Orgelschall,  Chorgesang  der  Prozessionen \r\nund  der  ihnen  entgegnenden  geistlichen  Chöre  konnten \r\nwirklich  das  Ohr  derjenigen  verwirren,  die  an  eine  so \r\nlärmende  Gottesverehrung  nicht  gewöhnt  waren. \r\nDie  frühe  Messe  war  kaum  geendigt,  als  zwei  wohlge- \r\nputzte Laufer  des  Vizekönigs  unsern  Gasthof  besuchten, \r\nin  der  doppelten  Absicht,  einmal  den  sämtlichen  Frem- \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  255 \r\n\r\nden  zum  Feste  zu  gratulieren  und  dagegen  ein  Trinkgeld \r\neinzunehmen,  mich  sodann  zur  Tafel  zu  laden,  weshalb \r\nmeine  Gabe  etwas  erhöht  werden  mußte. \r\nNachdem  ich  den  Morgen  zugebracht,  die  verschiedenen \r\nKirchen  zu  besuchen  und  die  Volksgesichter  und  Ge- \r\nstalten zu  betrachten,  fuhr  ich  zum  Palast  des  Vizekönigs, \r\nwelcher  am  obern  Ende  der  Stadt  liegt.  Weil  ich  etwas \r\nzu  früh  gekommen,  fand  ich  die  großen  Säle  noch  leer, \r\nnur  ein  kleiner  munterer  Mann  ging  auf  mich  zu,  den  ich \r\nsogleich  für  einen  Malteser  erkannte. \r\nAls  er  vernahm,  daß  ich  ein  Deutscher  sei,  fragte  er,  ob \r\nich  ihm  Nachricht  von  Erfurt  zu  geben  wisse;  er  habe  da- \r\nselbst einige  Zeit  sehr  angenehm  zugebracht.  Auf  seine \r\nErkundigungen  nach  der  von  Dacherödischen  Familie, \r\nnach  dem  Koadjutor  von  Dalberg  konnte  ich  ihm  hin- \r\nreichende Auskunft  geben,  worüber  er  sehr  vergnügt  nach \r\ndem  übrigen  Thüringen  fragte.  ]Mit  bedenklichem  Anteil \r\nerkundigte  er  sich  nach  Weimar.  Wie  steht  es  denn, \r\nsagte  er,  mit  dem  Manne,  der,  zu  meiner  Zeit  jung  und \r\nlebhaft,  daselbst  Regen  und  schönes  Wetter  machte?  Ich \r\nhabe  seinen  Namen  vergessen;  genug  aber,  es  ist  der \r\nVerfasser  des  Werthers!  —  Nach  einer  kleinen  Pause,  als \r\nwenn  ich  mich  bedächte,  erwiderte  ich:  Die  Person,  nach \r\nder  Ihr  Euch  gefällig  erkundigt,  bin  ich  selbst!  — •  Mit \r\ndem  sichtbarsten  Zeichen  des  Erstaunens  fuhr  er  zurück \r\nund  rief  aus:  Da  muß  sich  viel  verändert  haben!  —  O  ja! \r\nversetzte  ich;  zwischen  Weimar  und  Palermo  hab  ich \r\nmanche  Veränderung  gehabt. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  Augenblick  trat  mit  seinem  Gefolge  der  Vizekönig \r\nherein  und  betrug  sich  mit  anständiger  Freimütigkeit,  wie \r\nes  einem  solchen  Herrn  geziemt.  Er  enthielt  sich  jedoch \r\nnicht  des  Lächelns  über  den  Malteser,  welcher  seine  Ver- \r\nwunderung, mich  hier  zu  sehen,  auszudrücken  fortfuhr. \r\nBei  Tafel  sprach  der  Vizekönig,  neben  dem  ich  saß,  über \r\ndie  Absicht  meiner  Reise  und  versicherte,  daß  er  Befehl \r\ngeben  woUe,  mich  in  Palermo  alles  sehen  zu  lassen  und \r\nmich  auf  meinem  Wege  durch  Sizilien  auf  alle  Weise  zu \r\nfördern. \r\n\r\n\r\n256  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nAlotitag  den  g.  /Ipril. \r\n\r\n,  Heute  den  ganzen  Tag  beschäftigte  uns  der  Unsinn  des \r\nJ'rinzen  Pallagonia;  und  auch  diese  'lorheiten  waren  ganz \r\netwas  anders,  als  wir  uns  lesend  und  hörend  vorgestellt. \r\nDenn  bei  der  größten  Wahrheitsliebe  kommt  derjenige, \r\nder  vom  Absurden  Rechenschaft  geben  soll,  immer  ins \r\nGedränge:  er  will  einen  Begriff  davon  überliefern,  und  so \r\nmacht  er  es  schon  zu  etwas,  da  es  eigentlich  ein  Nichts \r\nist,  welches  für  etwas  gehalten  sein  will.  Und  so  muß \r\nich  noch  eine  andere  allgemeine  Reflexion  vorausschicken: \r\ndaß  weder  das  Abgeschmackteste  noch  das  Vortreff- \r\nlichste ganz  unmittelbar  aus  einem  Menschen,  aus  einer \r\n7ait\\\\.  hervorspringe,  daß  man  vielmehr  beiden  mit  einiger \r\nAufmerksamkeit  eine  Stammtafel  der  Herkunft  nachweisen \r\nkönne. \r\n\r\nJener  Brunnen  in  Palermo  gehört  unter  die  Vorfahren  der \r\nPallagonischen  Raserei,  nur  daß  diese  hier,  auf  eignem \r\nGrund  und  Boden,  in  der  größten  Freiheit  und  Breite \r\nsich  hervortut.  Ich  will  den  Verlauf  des  Entstehens  zu \r\nentwickeln  suchen. \r\n\r\nWenn  ein  Lustschloß  in  diesen  Gegenden  mehr  oder \r\nweniger  in  der  Mitte  des  ganzen  Besitztums  liegt  und \r\nman  also,  um  zu  der  herrschaftlichen  Wohnung  zu  ge- \r\nlangen, durch  gebaute  Felder,  Küchengärten  und  der- \r\ngleichen landwirtschaftliche  Nützlichkeiten  zu  fahren  hat, \r\nerweisen  sie  sich  haushältischer  als  die  Nordländer,  die \r\noft  eine  große  Strecke  guten  Bodens  zu  einer  Parkanlage \r\nverwenden,  um  mit  unfruchtbarem  Gesträuche  dem  Auge \r\nzu  schmeicheln.  Diese  Südländer  hingegen  führen  zwei \r\nMauern  auf,  zwischen  welchen  man  zum  Schloß  gelangt, \r\nohne  daß  man  gewahr  werde,  was  rechts  oder  links  vor- \r\ngeht. Dieser  Weg  beginnt  gewöhnlich  mit  einem  großen \r\nl^ortal,  wohl  auch  mit  einer  gewölbten  Halle  und  endigt \r\nim  Schloßhofe.  Damit  nun  aber  das  Auge  zwischen  diesen \r\nMauern  nicht  ganz  unbefriedigt  sei,  so  sind  sie  oben  aus- \r\ngebogen, mit  Schnörkeln  und  Postamenten  verziert,  wor- \r\nauf allenfalls  hie  und  da  eine  Vase  steht.  Die  Flächen \r\nsind  abgetüncht,  in  Felder  geteilt  und  angestrichen.    Der \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  257 \r\n\r\nSchloßhof  macht  ein  Rund  von  einstöckigen  Häusern,  wo \r\nGesinde  und  Arbeitsleute  wohnen;  das  viereckte  Schloß \r\nsteigt  über  alles  empor. \r\n\r\nDies  ist  die  Art  der  Anlage,  wie  sie  hei'kömmlich  gegeben \r\nist,  wie  sie  auch  schon  früher  mag  bestanden  haben,  bis \r\nder  Vater  des  Prinzen  das  Schloß  baute,  zwar  auch  nicht \r\nin  dem  besten,  aber  doch  erträglichem  Geschmack.  Der \r\njetzige  Besitzer  aber,  ohne  jene  allgemeine  Grundzüge \r\nzu  verlassen,  erlaubt  seiner  Lust  und  Leidenschaft  zu \r\nmißgestaltetem,  abgeschmackten  Gebilde  den  freisten \r\nLauf,  und  man  erzeigt  ihm  viel  zu  viel  Ehre,  wenn  man \r\nihm  nur  einen  Funken  Einbildungskraft  zuschreibt. \r\nWir  treten  also  in  die  große  Halle,  welche  mit  der \r\nGrenze  des  Besitztums  selbst  anfängt,  und  finden  ein \r\nAchteck,  sehr  hoch  zur  Pjreite.  Vier  ungeheure  Riesen \r\nmit  modernen  zugeknöpften  Gamaschen  tragen  das  Ge- \r\nsims, auf  welchem,  dem  Eingang  gerade  gegenüber,  die \r\nheilige  Dreieinigkeit  schwebt. \r\n\r\nDer  Vv'eg  nach  dem  Schlosse  zu  ist  breiter  als  gewöhnlich, \r\ndie  .Mauer  in  einen  fortlaufenden  hohen  Sockel  verwan- \r\ndelt, auf  welchem  ausgezeichnete  Basamente  seltsame \r\nGruppen  in  die  Höhe  tragen,  indessen  in  dem  Raum  von \r\neiner  zur  andern  mehrere  Vasen  aufgestellt  sind.  Das \r\nWiderliche  dieser  von  den  gemeinsten  Steinhauern  ge- \r\npfuschten Mißbildungen  wird  noch  dadurch  vermehrt,  daß \r\nsie  aus  dem  losesten  Muscheltuff  gearbeitet  sind;  doch \r\nwürde  ein  besseres  Material  den  Unwert  der  Form  nur \r\ndesto  mehr  in  die  Augen  setzen.  Ich  sagte  vorhin  Grup- \r\npen und  bediente  mich  eines  falschen,  an  dieser  Stelle \r\nuneigentlichen  Ausdrucks:  denn  diese  Zusammenstellungen \r\nsind  durch  keine  Art  von  Reflexion  oder  auch  nur  Will- \r\nkür entstanden,  sie  sind  vielmehr  zusammengewürfelt. \r\nJedesmal  drei  bilden  den  Schmuck  eines  solchen  vier- \r\neckten Postaments,  indem  ihre  Basen  so  eingerichtet \r\nsind,  daß  sie  zusammen  in  verschiedenen  Stellungen  den \r\nviereckigen  Raum  ausfüllen.  Die  vorzüglichste  besteht \r\ngewöhnlich  aus  zwei  Figuren,  und  ihre  Base  nimmt  den \r\ngrößten  vordem  Teil  des  Piedestals  ein;  diese  sind  meisten- \r\nteils Ungeheuer  von  tierischer  und  menschlicher  Gestalt. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  17 \r\n\r\n\r\n2  5  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  H \r\n\r\nUm  nun  den  hintern  Raum  derPiedestalfläche  auszufüllen, \r\nbedarf  es  noch  zweier  Stücke;  das  von  mittlerer  Größe \r\nstellt  gewöhnlich  einen  Schäfer  oder  eine  Schäferin,  einen \r\nKavalier  oder  eine  Dame,  einen  tanzenden  Affen  oder \r\nHund  vor.  Nun  bleibt  auf  dem  Piedestal  noch  eine  Lücke; \r\ndiese  wird  meistens  durch  einen  Zwerg  ausgefüllt,  wie \r\ndenn  überall  dieses  Geschlecht  bei  geistlosen  Scherzen \r\neine  große  Rolle  spielt. \r\n\r\nDaß  wir  aber  die  Elemente  der  Tollheit  des  Prinzen  Pal- \r\nlagonia  vollständig  überliefern,  geben  wir  nachstehendes \r\nVerzeichnis.  Menschen:  Bettler,  Bettlerinnen,  Spanier, \r\nSpanierinnen,  Mohren,  Türken,  Buckelige,  alle  Arten  Ver- \r\nwachsene, Zwerge,  Musikanten,  Pulcinelle,  antikkostü- \r\nmierte Soldaten,  Götter,  Göttinnen,  altfranzösisch  Ge- \r\nkleidete, Soldaten  mit  Patrontaschen  und  Gamaschen, \r\nMythologie  mit  fratzenhaften  Zutaten:  Achill  und  Chiron \r\nmit  Pulcinell.  Tiere:  nur  Teile  derselben,  Pferd  mit \r\nMenschenhänden,  Pferdekopf  auf  Menschenkörper,  ent- \r\nstellte Affen,  viele  Drachen  und  Schlangen,  alle  Arten \r\nvon  Pfoten  an  Figuren  aller  Art,  Verdoppelungen,  Ver- \r\nwechslungen der  Köpfe.  Vasen:  alle  Arten  von  Mon- \r\nstern und  Schnörkeln,  die  unterwärts  zu  Vasenbäuchen \r\nund  Untersätzen  endigen. \r\n\r\nDenke  man  sich  nun  dergleichen  Figuren  schockweise \r\nverfertigt  und  ganz  ohne  Sinn  und  Verstand  entsprungen, \r\nauch  ohne  Wahl  und  Absicht  zusammengestellt,  denke \r\nman  sich  diesen  Sockel,  diese  Piedestale  und  Unformen \r\nin  einer  unabsehbaren  Reihe,  so  wird  man  das  unange- \r\nnehme Gefühl  mitempfinden,  das  einen  jeden  überfallen \r\nmuß,  wenn  er  durch  diese  Spitzruten  des  Wahnsinns \r\ndurchgejagt  wird. \r\n\r\nWir  nähern  uns  dem  Schlosse  und  werden  durch  die \r\nArmeeines  halbrunden  Vorhofs  empfangen;  die  entgegen- \r\nstehende Hauptmauer,  wodurch  das  Tor  geht,  ist  burg- \r\nartig angelegt.  Hier  finden  wir  eine  ägyptische  Figur \r\neingemauert,  einen  Springbrunnen  ohne  Wasser,  ein \r\nMonument,  zerstreut  umherliegende  Vasen,  Statuen,  vor- \r\nsätzlich auf  die  Nase  gelegt.  Wir  treten  in  den  Schloß- \r\nhof und  finden  das  herkömmliche,  mit  kleinen  Gebäuden \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  259 \r\n\r\numgebene  Rund  in  kleineren  Halbzirkeln  ausgebogt,  da- \r\nmit es  ja  an  Mannigfaltigkeit  nicht  fehle. \r\nDer  Boden  ist  großenteils  mit  Gras  bewachsen.  Hier \r\nstehen,  wie  auf  einem  verfallenen  Kirchhofe,  seltsam  ge- \r\nschnörkelte  Marmorvasen  vom  Vater  her,  Zwerge  und \r\nsonstige  Ungestalten  aus  der  neuern  Epoche  zufällig \r\ndurcheinander,  ohne  daß  sie  bis  jetzt  einen  Platz  finden \r\nkönnen;  sogar  tritt  man  vor  eine  Laube,  vollgepfropft  von \r\nalten  Vasen  und  anderm  geschnörkelten  Gestein. \r\nDas  Widersinnige  einer  solchen  geschmacklosen  Denkart \r\nzeigt  sich  aber  im  höchsten  Grade  darin,  daß  die  Ge- \r\nsimse der  kleinen  Häuser  durchaus  schief  nach  einer  oder \r\nder  andern  Seite  hinhängen,  so  daß  das  Gefühl  der \r\nWasserwage  und  des  Perpendikels,  das  uns  eigentlich  zu \r\nMenschen  macht  und  der  Grund  aller  Eurhythmie  ist,  in \r\nuns  zerrissen  und  gequält  wird.  Und  so  sind  denn  auch \r\ndiese  Dachreihen  mit  Hydern  und  kleinen  Büsten,  mit \r\nmusizierenden  Aöenchören  und  ähnlichem  Wahnsinn  ver- \r\nbrämt. Drachen,  mit  Göttern  abwechselnd,  ein  Atlas,  der \r\nstatt  der  Himraelskugel  ein  Weinfaß  trägt. \r\nGedenkt  man  sich  aber  aus  allem  diesen  in  das  Schloß \r\nzu  retten,  welches,  vom  Vater  erbaut,  ein  relativ  ver- \r\nnünftiges äußeres  Ansehn  hat,  so  findet  man  nicht  weit \r\nvor  der  Pforte  den  lorbeerbekränzten  Kopf  eines  römi- \r\nschen Kaisers  auf  einer  Zwerggestalt,  die  auf  einem \r\nDelphin  sitzt. \r\n\r\nIm  Schlosse  selbst  nun,  dessen  Äußeres  ein  leidliches \r\nInnere  erwarten  läßt,  fängt  das  Fieber  des  Prinzen  schon \r\nwieder  zu  rasen  an,  die  Stuhlfüße  sind  ungleich  abgesägt, \r\nso  daß  niemand  Platz  nehmen  kann,  und  vor  den  sitz- \r\nbaren Stühlen  warnt  der  Kastellan,  weil  sie  unter  ihren \r\nSammetpolstern  Stacheln  verbergen.  Kandelaber  von \r\nchinesischem  Porzellan  stehen  in  den  Ecken,  welche, \r\nnäher  betrachtet,  aus  einzelnen  Schalen,  Ober-  und  Un- \r\ntertassen u.  dgl.  zusammengekittet  sind.  Kein  Winkel, \r\nwo  nicht  irgend  eine  Willkür  hervorblickte.  Sogar  der \r\nunschätzbare  Blick  über  die  Vorgebirge  ins  Meer  wird \r\ndurch  farbige  Scheiben  verkümmert,  welche  durch  einen \r\nunwahren  Ton  die  Gegend  entweder  verkälten  oder  ent- \r\n\r\n\r\n2  6  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  U \r\n\r\nzünden.  Eines  Kabinetts  muß  ich  noch  erwähnen,  welches \r\nans  alten  vergoldeten,  zusammengeschnittenen  Rahmen \r\naneinander  getäfelt  ist.  Alle  die  hundertfältigen  Schnitz- \r\nmuster, alle  die  verschiedenen  Abstufungen  einer  altern \r\noder  Jüngern,  mehr  oder  weniger  bestaubten  und  beschä- \r\ndigten Vergoldung  bedecken  hier,  hart  aneinander  ge- \r\ndrängt, die  sämtlichen  Wände  und  geben  den  Begriff  von \r\neinem  zerstückelten  Trödel. \r\n\r\nDie  Kapelle  zu  beschreiben,  wäre  allein  ein  Heftchen \r\nnötig.  Hier  findet  man  den  Aufschluß  über  den  ganzen \r\nWahnsinn,  der  nur  in  einem  bigotten  Geiste  bis  auf  diesen \r\nGrad  wuchern  konnte.  Wie  manches  Fratzenbild  einer \r\nirregeleiteten  Devotion  sich  hier  befinden  mag,  geb  ich \r\nzu  vermuten,  das  Beste  jedoch  will  ich  nicht  vorenthalten. \r\nFlach  an  der  Decke  nämlich  ist  ein  geschnitztes  Kruzifix \r\nvon  ziemlicher  Größe  befestigt,  nach  der  Natur  angemalt, \r\nlackiert,  mit  untermischter  Vergoldung.  Dem  Gekreu- \r\nzigten in  den  Nabel  ist  ein  Haken  eingeschraubt;  eine \r\nKette  aber,  die  davon  herabhängt,  befestigt  sich  in  den \r\nKopf  eines  knieend  betenden,  in  der  Luft  schwebenden \r\nMannes,  der,  angemalt  und  lackiert  wie  alle  übrigen  Bil- \r\nder der  Kirche,  wohl  ein  Sinnbild  der  ununterbrochenen \r\nAndacht  des  Besitzers  darstellen  soll. \r\nÜbrigens  ist  der  Palast  nicht  ausgebaut:  ein  großer,  von \r\ndem  Vater  bunt  und  reich  angelegter,  aber  doch  nicht \r\nwiderlich  verzierter  Saal  war  unvollendet  geblieben;  wie \r\ndenn  der  grenzenlose  Wahnsinn  des  Besitzers  mit  seinen \r\nNarrheiten  nicht  zu  Rande  kommen  kann. \r\nKniepen,  dessen  Künstlersinn  innerhalb  dieses  Toll- \r\nhauses zur  Verzweiflung  getrieben  wurde  ^  sah  ich  zum \r\nerstenmal  ungeduldig;  er  trieb  mich  fort,  da  ich  mir  die \r\nElemente  dieser  Unschöpfung  einzeln  zu  vergegenwärtigen \r\nund  zu  schematisieren  suchte.  Gutmütig  genug  zeichnete \r\ner  zuletzt  noch  eine  von  den  Zusammenstellungen,  die \r\neinzige,  die  noch  wenigstens  eine  Art  von  llild  gab.  Sie \r\nstellt  ein  Pferdweib,  auf  einem  Sessel  sitzend,  gegen \r\neinem  unterwärts  altmodisch  gekleideten,  mit  Greifenkopf, \r\nKrone  und  großer  Perücke  gezierten  Kavalier  Karte \r\nspielend,  vor,  und  erinnert  an  das  nach  allerTollheit  noch \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  261 \r\n\r\nimmer  höchst  merkwürdige  Wappen  des  Hauses  Palla- \r\ngonia:  ein  Satyr  hält  einem  Weibe,  das  einen  Pferdekopf \r\nhat,  einen  Spiegel  vor. \r\n\r\nDienstag  den  10.  April. \r\nHeute  fuhren  wir  bergauf  nach  Monreaie.  Ein  herrlicher \r\nWeg,  welchen  der  Abt  jenes  Klosters  zirr  Zeit  eines  über- \r\nschwenglichen Reichtums  angelegt  hat;  breit,  bequemen \r\nAnstiegs,  Bäume  hie  und  da,  besonders  aber  weitläufige \r\nSpring-  und  Röhrenbrunnen,  beinah  Pallagonisch  ver- \r\nschnörkelt und  verziert,  demohngeachtet  aber  Tiere  und \r\nMenschen  erquickend. \r\n\r\nDas  Kloster  San  Martin,  auf  der  Höhe  liegend,  ist  eine \r\nrespektable  Anlage.  Ein  Hagestolz  allein,  wie  man  am \r\nPrinzen  Pallagonia  sieht,  hat  selten  etwas  Vernünftiges \r\nhervorgebracht,  mehrere  zusammen  hingegen  die  aller- \r\ngrößten Werke,  wie  Kirchen  und  Klöster  zeugen.  Doch \r\nwirkten  die  geistlichen  Gesellschaften  wohl  nur  deswegen \r\nso  viel,  weil  sie  noch  mehr  als  irgend  ein  Familienvater \r\neiner  unbegrenzten  Nachkommenschaft  gewiß  waren. \r\nDie  Mönche  ließen  uns  ihre  Sammlungen  sehen.  Von \r\nAltertümern  und  natürlichen  Sachen  verwahren  sie  manches \r\nSchöne.  Besonders  fiel  uns  auf  eine  Medaille  mit  dem \r\nBilde  einer  jungen  Göttin,  das  Entzücken  erregen  mußte. \r\nGern  hätten  uns  die  guten  Männer  einen  Abdruck  mit- \r\ngegeben; es  war  aber  nichts  bei  Händen,  was  zu  irgend \r\neiner  Art  von  Form  tauglich  gewesen  wäre. \r\nNachdem  sie  uns  alles  vorgezeigt,  nicht  ohne  traurige \r\nVergleichung  der  vorigen  und  gegenwärtigen  Zustände, \r\nbrachten  sie  ims  in  einen  angenehmen  kleinen  Saal,  von \r\ndessen  Balkon  man  eine  liebliche  Aussicht  genoß:  hier \r\nwar  für  uns  beide  gedeckt,  und  es  fehlte  nicht  an  einem \r\nsehr  guten  Mittagsessen.  Nach  dem  aufgetragenen  Dessert \r\ntrat  der  Abt  herein,  begleitet  von  seinen  ältesten  Mön- \r\nchen, setzte  sich  zu  uns  und  blieb  wohl  eine  halbe  Stunde, \r\nin  welcher  Zeit  wir  manche  Frage  zu  beantworten  hatten. \r\nWir  schieden  aufs  freundlichste.  Die  jungem  begleiteten \r\nuns  nochmals  in  die  Zimmer  der  Sammlung  und  zuletzt \r\nnach  dem  Wagen. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nWir  fuhren  mit  ganz  andern  Gesinnungen  nach  Hause  als \r\ngestern.  Heute  hatten  wir  eine  große  Anstalt  zu  be- \r\ndauern, die  eben  zu  der  Zeit  versinkt,  indessen  an  der \r\nandern  Seite  ein  abgeschmacktes  Unternehmen  mit \r\nfrischem  Wachstum  hervorsteigt. \r\n\r\nDer  Weg  nach  San  Martin  geht  das  altere  Kalkgebirg \r\nhinauf.  Man  zertrümmert  die  Felsen  und  brennt  Kalk \r\ndaraus,  der  sehr  weiß  wird.  Zum  Brennen  brauchen  sie \r\neine  starke  lange  Grasart,  in  Bündeln  getrocknet.  Hier \r\nentsteht  nun  die  Calcara.  Bis  an  die  steilsten  Höhen \r\nliegt  roter  Ton  angeschwemmt,  der  hier  die  Dammerde \r\nvorstellt,  je  höher  je  röter,  wenig  durch  Vegetation  ge- \r\nschwärzt. Ich  sah  in  der  Entfernung  eine  Grube  fast  wie \r\nZinnober. \r\n\r\nDas  Kloster  steht  mitten  im  Kalkgebirg,  das  sehr  quellen- \r\nreich ist.    Die  Gebirge  umher  sind  wohlbebaut. \r\n\r\nMittwoch  den  ii.  April. \r\nNachdem  wir  nun  zwei  Hauptpunkte  außerhalb  der  Stadt \r\nbetrachtet,  begaben  wir  uns  in  den  Palast,  wo  der  ge- \r\nschäftige Laufer  die  Zimmer  und  ihren  Inhalt  vorzeigte. \r\nZu  unserm  großen  Schrecken  war  der  Saal,  worin  die \r\nAntiken  sonst  aufgestellt  sind,  eben  in  der  größten  Un- \r\nordnung, weil  man  eine  neue  architektonische  Dekoration \r\nim  Werke  hatte.  Die  Statuen  waren  von  ihren  Stellen \r\nweggenommen,  mit  Tüchern  verhängt,  mit  Gerüsten  ver- \r\nstellt, so  daß  wir,  trotz  allem  guten  Willen  unseres  Füh- \r\nrers und  einiger  Bemühung  der  Handwerksleute,  doch  nur \r\neinen  sehr  unvollständigen  Begriffdavon  erwerben  konnten. \r\nAm  meisten  war  mir  um  die  zwei  Widder  von  Erz  zu  tun, \r\nwelche,  auch  nur  unter  diesen  Umständen  gesehen,  den \r\nKunstsinn  höchlich  erbauten.  Sie  sind  liegend  vorgestellt, \r\ndie  eine  Pfote  vorwärts,  als  Gegenbilder  die  Köpfe  nach \r\nverschiedenen  Seiten  gekehrt;  mächtige  Gestalten  aus \r\nder  mythologischen  Familie,  Phrixus  und  Helle  zu  tragen \r\nwürdig.  Die  Wolle  nicht  kurz  und  kraus,  sondern  lang \r\nund  wellenartig  herabfallend,  mit  großer  Wahrheit  und \r\nEleganz  gebildet,  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit.  Sie \r\nsollen  in  dem  Hafen  von  Syrakus  gestanden  haben. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  263 \r\n\r\nNun  fülirte  uns  der  Laufer  außerhalb  der  Stadt  in  Kata- \r\nkomben, welche,  mit  architektonischem  Sinn  angelegt, \r\nkeineswegs  zu  Grabplätzen  benutzte  Steinbrüche  sind. \r\nIn  einem  ziemlich  verhärteten  Tuff  und  dessen  senkrecht \r\ngearbeiteter  Wand  sind  gewölbte  Öffnungen  und,  inner- \r\nhalb dieser,  Särge  ausgegraben,  mehrere  übereinander, \r\nalles  aus  der  Masse,  ohne  irgend  eine  Nachhülfe  von \r\nMauerwerk.  Die  oberen  Särge  sind  kleiner,  und  in  den \r\nRäumen  über  den  Pfeilern  sind  Grabstätten  für  Kinder \r\nangebracht. \r\n\r\nDon?ierstag  den  12.  April. \r\nMan  zeigte  uns  heute  das  Medaillenkabinett  des  Prinzen \r\nTorremuzza.  Gewissermaßen  ging  ich  ungern  hin.  Ich \r\nverstehe  von  diesem  Fach  zu  wenig,  und  ein  bloß  neu- \r\ngieriger Reisender  ist  wahren  Kennern  und  Liebhabern \r\nverhaßt.  Da  man  aber  doch  einmal  anfangen  muß,  so \r\nbequemte  ich  mich  und  hatte  davon  viel  Vergnügen  und \r\nVorteil.  Welch  ein  Gewinn,  wenn  man  auch  nur  vor- \r\nläufig übersieht,  wie  die  alte  Welt  mit  Städten  übersäet \r\nwar,  deren  kleinste,  wo  nicht  eine  ganze  Reihe  der  Kunst- \r\ngeschichte, wenigstens  doch  einige  Epochen  derselben \r\nuns  in  köstlichen  Münzen  hinterheß!  Aus  diesen  Schub- \r\nkasten lacht  uns  ein  unendlicher  Frühling  von  Blüten  und \r\nFrüchten  der  Kunst,  eines  in  höherem  Sinne  geführten \r\nLebensgewerbes  und  was  nicht  alles  noch  mehr  hervor. \r\nDer  Glanz  der  sizilischen  Städte,  jetzt  verdunkelt,  glänzt \r\naus  diesen  geformten  Metallen  wieder  frisch  entgegen. \r\nLeider  haben  wir  andern  in  unserer  Jugend  nur  die  Fami- \r\nlienmünzen besessen,  die  nichts  sagen,  und  die  Kaiser- \r\nmünzen, welche  dasselbe  Profil  bis  zum  Überdruß  wieder- \r\nholen: Bilder  von  Herrschern,  die  eben  nicht  als  Muster- \r\nbilder der  Menschheit  zu  betrachten  sind.  Wie  traurig \r\nhat  man  nicht  unsere  Jugend  auf  das  gestaltlose  Palästina \r\nund  auf  das  gestaltverwirrende  Rom  beschränkt.  Sizilien \r\nund  Neu-Griechenland  läßt  mich  nun  wieder  ein  frisches \r\nLeben  hoffen. \r\n\r\nDaß  ich  über  diese  Gegenstände  mich  in  allgemeine  Be- \r\ntrachtungen ergehe,  ist  ein  Beweis,  daß  ich  noch  nicht \r\n\r\n\r\n2  64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  n \r\n\r\nviel  davon  verstehen  gelernt  habe;  doch  das  wird  sich \r\nmit  dem  übrigen  nach  und  nach  schon  geben. \r\n\r\nHeute  am  Abend  ward  mir  noch  ein  Wunsch  erfüllt,  und \r\nzwar  auf  eigene  Weise.  Ich  stand  in  der  großen  Straße \r\nauf  den  Schrittsteinen,  an  jenem  Laden  mit  dem  Kauf- \r\nherrn scherzend;  auf  einmal  tritt  ein  Laufer,  groß,  wohl- \r\ngckleidet,  an  mich  heran,  einen  silbernen  Teller  rasch \r\nvorhaltend,  worauf  mehrere  Kupferpfennige,  wenige  Sil- \r\nberstücke lagen.  Da  ich  nicht  wußte,  was  es  heißen \r\nsolle,  so  zuckte  ich,  den  Kopf  duckend,  die  Achseln,  das \r\ngewöhnliche  Zeichen,  wodurch  man  sich  lossagt,  man \r\nmag  nun  Antrag  oder  P>age  nicht  verstehen  oder  nicht \r\nwollen.  F^benso  schnell,  als  er  gekommen,  war  er  fort, \r\nund  nun  bemerkte  ich  auf  der  entgegengesetzten  Seite \r\nder  Straße  seinen  Kameraden  in  gleicher  Beschäftigung. \r\nWas  das  bedeute,  fragte  ich  den  Handelsmann,  der  mit \r\nbedenklicher  Gebärde,  gleichsam  verstohlen,  auf  einen \r\nlangen  hagern  Herrn  deutete,  welcher  in  der  Straßen- \r\nmitte, hofmäßig  gekleidet,  anständig  und  gelassen  über \r\nden  Mist  einherschritt.  Frisiert  und  gepudert,  den  Hut \r\nunter  dem  Arm,  in  seidenem  Gewände,  den  Degen  an \r\nder  Seite,  ein  nettes  Fußwerk  mit  Steinschnallen  geziert, \r\nso  trat  der  Bejahrte  ernst  und  ruhig  einher;  aller  Augen \r\nwaren  auf  ihn  gerichtet. \r\n\r\nDies  ist  derPrinzPallagonia,  sagte  der  Händler,  welcher  von \r\nZeit  zu  Zeit  durch  die  Stadt  geht  und  für  die  in  der  Barbarei \r\ngefangenen  Sklaven  ein  Lösegeld  zusammenheischt.  Zwar \r\nbeträgt  dieses  Einsammeln  niemals  viel,  aber  der  Gegen- \r\nstand bleibt  doch  im  Andenken,  und  oft  vermachen  diejeni- \r\ngen, welche  bei  Lebzeiten  zurückhielten,  schöne  Summen  zu \r\nsolchem  Zweck.  Schon  viele  Jahre  ist  der  Prinz  Vorsteher \r\ndieser  Anstalt  und  hat  unendlich  viel  Gutes  gestiftet. \r\nStatt  auf  die  Torheiten  seines  I^andsitzes,  rief  ich  aus, \r\nhätte  er  hierher  jene  großen  Summen  verwenden  sollen. \r\nKein  Fürst  in  der  Welt  hätte  mehr  geleistet. \r\nDagegen  sagte  der  Kaufmann:  Sind  wir  doch  alle  so! \r\nunsere  Narrheiten  bezahlen  wir  gar  gerne  selbst,  zu  unsern \r\nTugenden  sollen  andere  das  (Jeld  hergeben. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  265 \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  13.  April. \r\nVorgearbeitet  in  dem  Steinreiche  Siziliens  hat  uns  Graf \r\nBorch  sehr  emsig,  und  wer  nach  ihm  gleichen  Sinnes  die \r\nInsel  besucht,  wird  ihm  recht  gern  Dank  zollen.  Ich \r\nfinde  es  angenehm  sowie  pflichtmäßig,  das  Andenken \r\neines  Vorgängers  zu  feiern.  Bin  ich  doch  nur  ein  Vorfahre \r\nvon  künftigen  andern,  im  Leben  wie  auf  der  Reise! \r\nDie  Tätigkeit  des  Grafen  scheint  mir  übrigens  größer  als \r\nseine  Kenntnisse;  er  verfährt  mit  einem  gewissen  Selbst- \r\nbehagen, welches  dem  bescheidenen  Ernst  zuwider  ist, \r\nmit  welchem  man  wichtige  Gegenstände  behandeln  sollte. \r\nIndessen  ist  sein  Heft  in  Quart,  ganz  dem  sizilianischen \r\nSteinreich  gewidmet,  mir  von  großem  Vorteil,  und  ich \r\nkonnte,  dadurch  vorbereitet,  die  Steinschleifer  mit  Nutzen \r\nbesuchen,  welche,  früher  mehr  beschäftigt,  zur  Zeit,  als \r\nKirchen  und  Altäre  noch  mit  Marmor  und  Achaten  über- \r\nlegt werden  mußten,  das  Handwerk  doch  noch  immer \r\nforttreiben.  Bei  ihnen  bestellte  ich  Muster  von  weichen \r\nund  harten  Steinen;  denn  so  unterscheiden  sie  Marmor \r\nund  Achate  hauptsächlich  deswegen,  weil  die  Verschie- \r\ndenheit des  Preises  sich  nach  diesem  Unterschiede  richtet. \r\nDoch  wissen  sie,  außer  diesen  beiden,  sich  noch  viel  mit \r\neinem  Material,  einem  Feuererzeugnis  ihrer  Kalköfen. \r\nIn  diesen  findet  sich  nach  dem  Brande  eine  Art  Glasfluß, \r\nwelcher  von  der  hellsten  blauen  Farbe  zur  dunkelsten,  ja \r\nzur  schwärzesten  übergeht.  Diese  Klumpen  werden,  wie \r\nanderes  Gestein,  in  dünne  Tafeln  geschnitten,  nach  der \r\nHöhe  ihrer  Farbe  und  Reinheit  geschätzt  und  anstatt \r\nLapis  Lazuli  beim  Fournieren  von  Altären,  Grabmälern \r\nund  andern  kirchlichen  Verzierungen  mit  Glück  ange- \r\nwendet. \r\n\r\nEine  vollständige  Sammlung,  wie  ich  sie  wünsche,  ist \r\nnicht  fertig;  man  wird  sie  mir  erst  nach  Neapel  schicken. \r\nDie  Achate  sind  von  der  größten  Schönheit,  besonders \r\ndiejenigen,  in  welchen  unregelmäßige  Flecken  von  gelbem \r\noder  rotem  Jaspis  mit  weißem,  gleichsam  gefrorenen \r\nQuarze  abwechseln  und  dadurch  die  schönste  Wirkung \r\nhervorbringen. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nEine  genaue  Nachahmung  solcher  Achate,  auf  der  Rück- \r\nseite dünner  Glasscheiben  durch  Lackfarben  bewirkt,  ist \r\ndas  einzige  Vernünftige,  was  ich  aus  dem  Pallagonischen \r\nUnsinn  jenes  Tages  herausfand.  Solche  Tafeln  nehmen \r\nsich  zur  Dekoration  schöner  aus  als  der  echte  Achat,  in- \r\ndem dieser  aus  vielen  kleinen  Stücken  zusammengesetzt \r\nwerden  muß,  bei  jenen  hingegen  die  Größe  der  Tafeln \r\nvom  Architekten  abhängt.  Dieses  Kunststück  verdiente \r\nwohl  nachgeahmt  zu  werden. \r\n\r\nItalien  ohne  Sizilien  macht  gar  kein  Bild  in  der  Seele: \r\nhier  ist  erst  der  Schlüssel  zu  allem. \r\n\r\nVom  Klima  kann  man  nicht  Gutes  genug  sagen;  jetzt  ist's \r\nRegenzeit,  aber  immer  unterbrochen,  heute  donnert  und \r\nblitzt  es,  und  alles  wird  mit  Macht  grün.  Der  Lein  hat \r\nschon  zum  Teil  Knoten  gewonnen,  der  andere  Teil  blüht. \r\nMan  glaubt  in  den  Gründen  kleine  Teiche  zu  sehen,  so \r\nschön  blaugrün  liegen  die  Leinfelder  unten.  Der  reizen- \r\nden Gegenstände  sind  unzählige!  Und  mein  Geselle  ist \r\nein  exzellenter  Mensch,  der  wahre  Hoftegut,  so  wie  ich \r\nredlich  den  Treufreund  fortspiele.  Er  hat  schon  recht \r\nschöne  Konture  gemacht  und  wird  noch  das  Beste  mit- \r\nnehmen. Welche  Aussicht,  mit  meinen  Schätzen  dereinst \r\nglücklich  nach  Hause  zu  kommen! \r\n\r\nVom  Essen  und  Trinken  hierzuland  hab  ich  noch \r\nnichts  gesagt,  und  doch  ist  es  kein  kleiner  Artikel.  Die \r\nGartenfrüchte  sind  herrlich,  besonders  der  Salat  von  Zart- \r\nheit und  Geschmack  wie  eine  Milch;  man  begreift,  war- \r\num ihn  die  Alten  lactuca  genannt  haben.  Das  Öl,  der \r\nWein,  alles  sehr  gut,  und  sie  könnten  noch  besser  sein, \r\nwenn  man  auf  ihre  Bereitung  mehr  Sorgfalt  verwendete. \r\nFische  die  besten,  zartesten.  Auch  haben  wir  diese  Zeit \r\nher  sehr  gut  Rindfleisch  gehabt,  ob  man  es  gleich  sonst \r\nnicht  loben  will. \r\n\r\nNun  vom  Mittagsessen  ans  Fenster!  auf  die  Straße!  Es \r\nward  ein  Missetäter  begnadigt,  welches  immer  zu  Ehren \r\nder  heilbringenden  Osterwoche  geschieht.  Eine  Brüder- \r\nschaft führt  ihn  bis  unter  einen  zum  Schein  aufgebauten \r\nGalgen;  dort  muß  er  vor  der  Leiter  eine  Andacht  ver- \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  267 \r\n\r\nrichten,  die  Leiter  küssen  und  wird  dann  wieder  wegge- \r\nführt. Es  war  ein  hübscher  Mensch  vom  Mittelstande, \r\nfrisiert,  einen  weißen  Frack,  weißen  Hut,  alles  weiß.  Er \r\ntrug  den  Hut  in  der  Hand,  und  man  hätte  ihm  hie  und \r\nda  nur  bunte  Bänder  anheften  dürfen,  so  konnte  er  als \r\nSchäfer  auf  jede  Redoute  gehen. \r\n\r\n\r\nDen  13.  und  14.  April. \r\nUnd  so  sollte  mir  denn  kurz  vor  dem  Schlüsse  ein  sonder- \r\nbares Abenteuer  beschert  sein,  wovon  ich  sogleich  um- \r\nständliche Nachricht  erteile. \r\n\r\nSchon  die  ganze  Zeit  meines  Aufenthalts  hörte  ich  an \r\nunserm  öffentlichen  Tische  manches  über  Cagliostro, \r\ndessen  Herkunft  und  Schicksale  reden.  Die  Palermitaner \r\nwaren  darin  einig,  daß  ein  gewisser  Joseph  Balsamo,  in \r\nihrer  Stadt  geboren,  wegen  mancherlei  schlechter  Streiche \r\nberüchtigt  und  verbannt  sei.  Ob  aber  dieser  mit  dem \r\nGrafen  Cagliostro  nur  eine  Person  sei,  darüber  waren  die \r\nMeinungen  geteilt.  Einige,  die  ihn  ehemals  gesehen \r\nhatten,  wollten  seine  Gestalt  in  jenem  Kupferstiche  wie- \r\nderfinden, der  bei  uns  bekaniAf^  genug  ist  und  auch  nach \r\nPalermo  gekommen  war. \r\n\r\nUnter  solchen  Gesprächen  berief  sich  einer  der  Gäste  auf \r\ndie  Bemühungen,  welche  ein  palermitanischer  Rechts- \r\ngelehrter übernommen,  diese  Sache  ins  klare  zu  bringen. \r\nEr  war  durch  das  französische  Ministerium  veranlaßt \r\nworden,  dem  Herkommen  eines  Mannes  nachzuspüren, \r\nwelcher  die  Frechheit  gehabt  hatte,  vor  dem  Angesichte \r\nFrankreichs,  ja  man  darf  wohl  sagen  der  Welt,  bei  einem \r\nwichtigen  und  gefährlichen  Prozesse  die  albernsten  Mär- \r\nchen vorzubringen. \r\n\r\nEs  habe  dieser  Rechtsgelehrte,  erzählte  man,  den  Stamm- \r\nbaum des  Joseph  Balsamo  aufgestellt  und  ein  erläutern- \r\ndes Memoire  mit  beglaubigten  Beilagen  nach  Frankreich \r\nabgeschickt,  wo  man  wahrscheinlich  davon  öffentlichen \r\nGebrauch  machen  werde. \r\n\r\nIch  äußerte  den  Wunsch,  diesen  Rechtsgelehrten,  von \r\nwelchem  außerdem  viel  Gutes  gesprochen  wurde,  kennen \r\n\r\n\r\n2  68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nzu  lernen,  und  der  Erzähler  erbot  sich,  mich  bei  ihm  an- \r\nzumelden und  zu  ihm  zu  führen. \r\n\r\nNach  einigen  Tagen  gingen  wir  hin  und  fanden  ihn  mit \r\nseinen  Klienten  beschäftigt.  Als  er  diese  abgefertigt  und \r\nwir  das  Frühstück  genommen  hatten,  brachte  er  ein  Manu- \r\nskript hervor,  welches  den  Stammbaum  Cagliostros,  die \r\nzu  dessen  Begründung  nötigen  Dokumente  in  Abschrift \r\nund  das  Konzept  eines  Memoire  enthielt,  das  nach  Frank- \r\nreich abgegangen  war. \r\n\r\nEr  legte  mir  den  Stammbaum  vor  und  gab  mir  die  nötigen \r\nErklärungen  darüber,  wovon  ich  hier  so  viel  anführe,  als \r\nzu  leichterer  Einsicht  nötig  ist. \r\n\r\nJoseph  Balsamos  Urgroßvater  mütterlicher  Seite  war \r\nMatthäus  Martello.  Der  Gcliurtsname  seiner  Urgroß- \r\nmutter ist  unbekannt.  Aus  dieser  Ehe  entsprangen  zwei \r\nTöchter,  eine  namens  Maria,  die  an  Joseph  Braconieri \r\nverheiratet  und  Großmutter  Joseph  Balsamos  ward.  Die \r\nandere,  namens  Vincenza,  verheiratete  sich  an  Joseph \r\nCagliostro,  der  von  einem  kleinen  Orte  La  Noara,  acht \r\nMeilen  von  Messina,  gebürtig  war.  Ich  bemerke  hier, \r\ndaß  zu  Messina  noch  zwei  Glockengießer  dieses  Namens \r\nleben.  Die  Großtante  wa/i  h  der  Folge  Pate  bei  Joseph \r\nBalsamo;  er  erhielt  den  Taufnamen  ihres  Mannes  und \r\nnahm  endlich  auswärts  auch  den  Zunamen  Cagliostro  von \r\nseinem  Großonkel  an. \r\n\r\nDie  Eheleute  Braconieri  hatten  drei  Kinder:  Felicitas, \r\nMatthäus  und  Antonin. \r\n\r\nFelicitas  ward  an  Peter  Balsamo  verheiratet,  den  Sohn \r\neines  Bandhändlers  in  Palermo,  Antonin  Balsamo,  der \r\nvermutlich  von  jüdischem  Geschlecht  abstammte.  Peter \r\nBalsamo,  der  Vater  des  berüchtigten  Josephs,  machte \r\nBankerott  und  starb  in  seinem  fünfundvierzigsten  Jahre. \r\nSeine  Witwe,  welche  noch  gegenwärtig  lebt,  gab  ihm \r\naußer  dem  benannten  Joseph  noch  eine  Tochter  Johanna \r\nJoseph-Maria,  welche  an  Johann  Baptista  Capitummino \r\nverheiratet  wurde,  der  mit  ihr  drei  Kinder  zeugte  und \r\nstarb. \r\n\r\nDas  Memoire,  welches  uns  der  gefällige  Verfasser  vorlas \r\nund  mir  auf  mein  Ersuchen  einige  Tage  anvertraute,  war \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  269 \r\n\r\nauf  Taufscheine,  Ehekontrakte  und  andere  Instrumente \r\ngegründet,  die  mit  Sorgfalt  gesammelt  waren.  Es  ent- \r\nhielt ungefähr  die  Umstände  —  wie  ich  aus  einem  Aus- \r\nzug, den  ich  damals  gemacht,  ersehe  —  die  uns  nunmehr \r\naus  den  römischen  Prozeßakten  bekannt  geworden  sind, \r\ndaß  Joseph  Balsamo  anfangs  Juni  1743  zu  Palermo  ge- \r\nboren, von  Vincenza  Martello,  verheirateter  Cagliostro, \r\naus  der  Taufe  gehoben  sei,  daß  er  in  seiner  Jugend  das \r\nKleid  der  barmherzigen  Brüder  genommen,  eines  Ordens, \r\nder  besonders  Kranke  verpflegt,  daß  er  bald  viel  Geist \r\nund  Geschick  für  die  Medizin  gezeigt,  doch  aber  wegen \r\nseiner  Übeln  Aufführung  fortgeschickt  worden,  daß  er  in \r\nPalermo  nachher  den  Zauberer  und  Schatzgräber  ge- \r\nmacht. \r\n\r\nSeine  große  Gabe,  alle  Hände  nachzuahmen,  ließ  er  nicht \r\nunbenutzt  (so  fähil  das  Memoire  fort).  Er  verfälschte \r\noder  verfertigte  vielmehr  ein  altes  Dokument,  wodiu:ch \r\ndas  Eigentum  einiger  Güter  in  Streit  geriet.  Er  kam  in \r\nUntersuchung,  ins  Gefängnis,  entfloh  und  ward  ediktaliter \r\nzitiert.  Er  reiste  durch  Kalabrien  nach  Rom,  wo  er  die \r\nTochter  eines  Gürtlers  heiratete.  Von  Rom  kehrte  er \r\nnach  Neapel  unter  dem  Namen  Marchese  Pellegrini  zu- \r\nrück. Er  wagte  sich  wieder  nach  Palermo,  ward  erkannt, \r\ngefänglich  eingezogen  und  kam  nur  auf  eine  Weise  los, \r\ndie  wert  ist,  daß  ich  sie  umständlich  erzähle. \r\nDer  Sohn  eines  der  ersten  sizilianischen  Prinzen  und \r\ngroßen  Güterbesitzers,  eines  Mannes,  der  an  dem  neapo- \r\nlitanischen Hofe  ansehnliche  Stellen  bekleidete,  verband \r\nmit  einem  starken  Körper  und  einer  unbändigen  Gemüts- \r\nart allen  Übermut,  zu  dem  sich  der  Reiche  und  Große \r\nohne  Bildung  berechtigt  glaubt. \r\n\r\nDonna  Lorenza  wußte  ihn  zu  gewinnen,  und  auf  ihn  baute \r\nder  verstellte  Marchese  Pellegrini  seine  Sicherheit.  Der \r\nPrinz  zeigte  öffentlich,  daß  er  dies  angekommene  Paar \r\nbeschütze;  aber  in  welche  Wut  geriet  er,  als  Joseph  Bal- \r\nsamo auf  Anrufen  der  Partei,  welche  durch  seinen  Betrug \r\nSchaden  gelitten,  abermals  ins  Gefängnis  gebracht  wurde! \r\nEr  versuchte  verschiedene  Mittel,  ihn  zu  befrein,  und  da \r\nsie  ihm  nicht  crelingen  wollten,  drohte  er  im  Vorzimmer \r\n\r\n\r\n2  7  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ndes  Präsidenten,  den  Advokaten  der  Gegenpartei  aufs \r\ngrimmigste  zu  mißhandeln,  wenn  er  nicht  sogleich  die \r\nVerhaftung  des  Balsamo  wieder  aufhöbe.  Als  der  gegen- \r\nseitige Sachwalter  sich  weigerte,  ergriff  er  ihn,  schlug \r\nihn,  warf  ihn  auf  die  Erde,  trat  ihn  mit  Füßen  und  war \r\nkaum  von  mehreren  Mißhandlungen  abzuhalten,  als  der \r\nPräsident  selbst  auf  den  Lärm  herauseilte  und  Frieden \r\ngebot. \r\n\r\nDieser,  ein  schwacher,  abhängiger  Mann,  wagte  nicht, \r\nden  Beleidiger  zu  bestrafen;  die  Gegenpartei  und  ihr \r\nSachwalter  wurden  kleinmütig,  und  Balsamo  ward  in  Frei- \r\nheit gesetzt,  ohne  daß  bei  den  Akten  sich  eine  Registra- \r\ntur über  seine  Loslassung  befindet,  weder  wer  sie  verfügt, \r\nnoch  wie  sie  geschehen. \r\n\r\nBald  darauf  entfernte  er  sich  von  Palermo  und  tat  ver- \r\nschiedene Reisen,  von  welchen  der  Verfasser  nur  unvoll- \r\nständige Nachrichten  geben  konnte. \r\nDas  Memoire  endigte  sich  mit  einem  scharfsinnigen  Be- \r\nweise, daß  Cagliostro  und  Balsamo  eben  dieselbe  Person \r\nsei,  eine  These,  die  damals  schwerer  zu  behaupten  war, \r\nals  sie  es  jetzt  ist,  da  wir  von  dem  Zusammenhang  der \r\nGeschichte  vollkommen  unterrichtet  sind. \r\nHätte  ich  nicht  damals  vermuten  müssen,  daß  man  in \r\nFrankreich  einen  öffentlichen  Gebrauch  von  jenem  Auf- \r\nsatz machen  würde,  daß  ich  ihn  vielleicht  bei  meiner \r\nZurückkunft  schon  gedruckt  anträfe,  so  wäre  es  mir  er- \r\nlaubt gewesen,  eine  Abschrift  zu  nehmen  und  meine \r\nFreunde  und  das  Publikum  früher  von  manchen  inter- \r\nessanten Umständen  zu  unterrichten. \r\nIndessen  haben  wir  das  meiste  und  mehr,  als  jenes  Me- \r\nmoire enthalten  konnte,  von  einer  Seite  her  erfahren,  von \r\nder  sonst  nur  Irrtümer  auszuströmen  pflegten.  Wer  hätte \r\ngeglaubt,  daß  Rom  einmal  zur  Aufklärung  der  Welt,  zur \r\nvölligen  Entlarvung  eines  Betrügers  so  viel  beitragen \r\nsollte,  als  es  durch  die  Herausgabe  jenes  yVuszugs  aus \r\nden  Prozeßakten  geschehen  ist!  Denn  obgleich  diese \r\nSchrift  weit  interessanter  sein  könnte  und  sollte,  so  bleibt \r\nsie  doch  immer  ein  schönes  Dokument  in  den  Händen \r\neines  jeden  Vernünftigen,   der  es  mit  Verdruß  ansehen \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  271 \r\n\r\nmußte,  daß  Betrogene,  Halbbetrogene  und  Betrüger \r\ndiesen  Menschen  und  seine  Possenspiele  jahrelang  ver- \r\nehrten, sich  durch  die  Gemeinschaft  mit  ihm  über  andre \r\nerhoben  fühlten  und  von  der  Höhe  ihres  gläubigen  Dün- \r\nkels den  gesunden  Menschenverstand  bedauerten,  wo \r\nnicht  geringschätzten. \r\n\r\nWer  schwieg  nicht  gern  während  dieser  Zeit?  Und  auch \r\nnur  jetzt,  nachdem  die  ganze  Sache  geendigt  und  a^oßer \r\nStreit  gesetzt  ist,  kann  ich  es  über  mich  gewinnen,  zu \r\nKomplettierung  der  Akten  dasjenige,  was  mir  bekannt  ist, \r\nmitzuteilen. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  in  dem  Stammbaume  so  manche  Personen,  be- \r\nsonders Mutter  und  Schwester,  noch  als  lebend  angegeben \r\nfand,  bezeigte  ich  dem  Verfasser  des  Memoire  meinen \r\nWunsch,  sie  zu  sehen  und  die  Verwandten  eines  so  son- \r\nderbaren Menschen  kennen  zu  lernen.  Er  versetzte,  daß \r\nes  schwer  sein  werde,  dazu  zu  gelangen,  indem  diese \r\nMenschen,  arm  aber  ehrbar,  sehr  eingezogen  lebten,  keine \r\nFremden  zu  sehen  g'ewohnt  seien  und  der  argwöhnische \r\nCharakter  der  Nation  sich  aus  einer  solchen  Erscheinung \r\nallerlei  deuten  werde;  doch  er  wolle  mir  seinen  Schreiber \r\nschicken,  der  bei  der  Familie  Zutritt  habe  und  durch  den \r\ner  die  Nachrichten  und  Dokumente,  woraus  der  Stamm- \r\nbaum zusammengesetzt  worden,  erhalten. \r\nDen  folgenden  Tag  erschien  der  Schreiber  und  äußerte \r\nwegen  des  Unternehmens  einige  Bedenklichkeiten.  Ich \r\nhabe,  sagte  er,  bisher  immer  vermieden,  diesen  Leuten \r\nwieder  unter  die  Augen  zu  treten;  denn  um  ihre  Ehe- \r\nkontrakte, Taufscheine  und  andere  Papiere  in  die  Hände \r\nzu  bekommen  und  von  selbigen  legale  Kopien  machen  zu \r\nkönnen,  mußte  ich  mich  einer  eigenen  List  bedienen.  Ich \r\nnahm  Gelegenheit,  von  einem  Familienstipendio  zu  reden, \r\ndas  irgendwo  vakant  war,  machte  ihnen  wahrscheinlich, \r\ndaß  der  junge  Capitummino  sich  dazu  qualifiziere,  daß \r\nman  vor  allen  Dingen  einen  Stammbaum  aufsetzen  müsse, \r\num  zu  sehen,  inwiefern  der  Knabe  Ansprüche  darauf \r\nmachen  könne;  es  werde  freilich  nachher  alles  auf  Nego- \r\nziation ankommen,  die  ich  übernehmen  wolle,  wenn  man \r\nmir  einen  billigen  Teil  der  zu  erhaltenden  Summe  für \r\n\r\n\r\n272  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nmeine  Bemühungen  verspräche.  Mit  Freuden  willigten \r\ndie  guten  Leute  in  alles;  ich  erhielt  die  nötigen  Papiere, \r\ndie  Kopien  wurden  genommen,  der  Stammbaum  aus- \r\ngearbeitet, und  seit  der  Zeit  hüte  ich  mich,  vor  ihnen  zu \r\nerscheinen.  Noch  vor  einigen  Wochen  wurde  mich  die \r\nalte  Capitummino  gewahr,  und  ich  wußte  mich  nur  mit \r\nder  Langsamkeit,  womit  hier  dergleichen  Sachen  vor- \r\nwärts gehen,  zu  entschuldigen. \r\n\r\nSo  sagte  der  Schreiber.  Da  ich  aber  von  meinem  Vor- \r\nsatz nicht  abging,  wurden  wir  nach  einiger  Überlegung \r\ndahin  einig,  daß  ich  mich  für  einen  Engländer  ausgeben \r\nund  der  Familie  Nachrichten  von  Cagliostro  bringen \r\nsollte,  der  eben  aus  der  Gefangenschaft  der  Bastille  nach \r\nLondon  gegangen  war. \r\n\r\nZur  gesetzten  Stunde,  es  mochte  etwa  drei  Uhr  nach \r\nMittag  sein,  machten  wir  uns  auf  den  Weg.  Das  Haus \r\nlag  in  dem  Winkel  eines  Gäßchens,  nicht  weit  von  der \r\nHauptstraße,  il  Cassaro  genannt.  Wir  stiegen  eine  elende \r\nTreppe  hinauf  und  kamen  sogleich  in  die  Küche.  Eine \r\nFrau  von  mittlerer  Größe,  stark  und  breit,  ohne  fett  zu \r\nsein,  war  beschäftigt,  das  Küchengeschirr  aufzuwaschen. \r\nSie  war  reinlich  gekleidet  und  schlug,  als  wir  hineintraten, \r\ndas  eine  Ende  der  Schürze  hinauf,  um  vor  uns  die  schmut- \r\nzige Seite  zu  verstecken.  Sie  sah  meinen  Führer  freu- \r\ndig an  und  sagte:  Signor  Giovanni,  bringen  Sie  uns  gute \r\nNachrichten?  haben  Sie  etwas  ausgerichtet? \r\nEr  versetzte:  In  unsrer  Sache  hat  mir's  noch  nicht  ge- \r\nlingen wollen;  hier  ist  aber  ein  Fremder,  der  einen  Gruß \r\nvon  Ihrem  Bruder  bringt  und  Ihnen  erzählen  kann,  wie \r\ner  sich  gegenwärtig  befindet. \r\n\r\nDer  Gruß,  den  ich  bringen  sollte,  war  nicht  ganz  in \r\nunserer  Abrede;  indessen  war  die  Einleitung  einmal  ge- \r\nmacht.—  Sie  kennen  meinen  Bruder?  fragte  sie. — Es \r\nkennt  ihn  ganz  Europa,  versetzte  ich;  und  ich  glaube,  es \r\nwird  Ihnen  angenehm  sein,  zu  hören,  daß  er  sich  in \r\nSicherheit  und  wohl  befindet,  da  Sie  bisher  wegen  seines \r\nSchicksals  gewiß  in  Sorgen  gewesen  sind. — Treten  Sie \r\nhinein,  sagte  sie;  ich  folge  Ihnen  gleich. — Und  ich  trat \r\nmit  dem  Schreiber  in  das  Zimmer. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  273 \r\n\r\nEs  war  groß  und  hoch,  daß  es  bei  uns  für  einen  Saal \r\ngelten  würde;  es  schien  aber  auch  beinah  die  ganze \r\nWohnung  der  Familie  zu  sein.  Ein  einziges  Fenster  er- \r\nleuchtete die  großen  Wände,  die  einmal  Farbe  gehabt \r\nhatten  und  auf  denen  schwarze  Heiligenbilder  in  goldnen \r\nRahmen  herumhingen.  Zwei  große  Betten  ohne  Vor- \r\nhänge standen  an  der  einen  Wand,  ein  braunes  Schränk- \r\nchen,  das  die  Gestalt  eines  Schreibtisches  hatte,  an  der \r\nandern.  Alte,  mit  Rohr  durchflochtene  Stühle,  deren \r\nLehnen  ehmals  vergoldet  gewesen,  standen  darneben,  und \r\ndie  Backsteine  des  Fußbodens  waren  an  vielen  Stellen \r\ntief  ausgetreten.  Übrigens  war  alles  reinlich,  und  wir \r\nnäherten  uns  der  Familie,  die  am  andern  Ende  des  Zim- \r\nmers an  dem  einzigen  Fenster  versammelt  war. \r\nIndes  mein  Führer  der  alten  Balsamo,  die  in  der  Ecke \r\nsaß,  die  Ursache  unsers  Besuchs  erklärte  und  seine  Worte \r\nwegen  der  Taubheit  der  guten  Alten  mehrmals  laut  wie- \r\nderholte, hatte  ich  Zeit,  das  Zimmer  und  die  übrigen \r\nPersonen  zu  betrachten.  Ein  Mädchen  von  ungefähr  sech- \r\nzehn Jahren,  wohlgewachsen,  deren  Gesichtszüge  durch \r\ndie  Blattern  undeutlich  geworden  waren,  stand  am  Fen- \r\nster; neben  ihr  ein  junger  Mensch,  dessen  unangenehme, \r\ndurch  die  Blattern  entstellte  Bildung  mir  auch  auffiel.  In \r\neinem  Lehnstuhl  saß  oder  lag  vielmehr,  gegen  dem  Fen- \r\nster über,  eine  kranke,  sehr  ungestaltete  Person,  die  mit \r\neiner  Art  Schlafsucht  behaftet  schien. \r\nAls  mein  Führer  sich  deutlich  gemacht  hatte,  nötigte \r\nman  uns  zum  Sitzen.  Die  Alte  tat  einige  Fragen  an  mich, \r\ndie  ich  mir  aber  mußte  dolmetschen  lassen,  eh  ich  sie \r\nbeantworten  konnte,  da  mir  der  sizilianische  Dialekt  nicht \r\ngeläufig  war. \r\n\r\nIch  betrachtete  indessen  die  alte  Frau  mit  Vergnügen. \r\nSie  war  von  mittlerer  Größe,  aber  wohlgebildet;  über \r\nihre  regelmäßigen  Gesichtszüge,  die  das  Alter  nicht  ent- \r\nstellt hatte,  war  der  Friede  verbreitet,  dessen  gewöhnlich \r\ndie  Menschen  genießen,  die  des  Gehörs  beraubt  sind; \r\nder  Ton  ihrer  Stimme  war  sanft  und  angenehm. \r\nIch  beantwortete  ihre  Fragen,  und  meine  Antworten \r\nmußten  ihr  auch  wieder  verdolmetscht  werden. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  18 \r\n\r\n\r\n2  74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nDie  Langsamkeit  unserer  Unterredung  gab  mir  Gelegen- \r\nheit, meine  Worte  abzumessen.  Ich  erzählte  ihr,  daß  ihr \r\nSohn  in  Frankreich  losgesprochen  worden  und  sich  gegen- \r\nwärtig in  England  befinde,  wo  er  wohl  aufgenommen  sei. \r\nIhre  Freude,  die  sie  über  diese  Nachrichten  äußerte, \r\nwar  mit  Ausdrücken  einer  herzlichen  Frömmigkeit  be- \r\ngleitet, und  da  sie  nun  etwas  lauter  und  langsamer  sprach, \r\nkönnt  ich  sie  eher  verstehen. \r\n\r\nIndessen  war  ihre  Tochter  hereingekommen  und  hatte \r\nsich  zu  meinem  Führer  gesetzt,  der  ihr  das,  was  ich  er- \r\nzählt hatte,  getreulich  wiederholte.  Sie  hatte  eine  rein- \r\nliche Schürze  vorgebunden  und  ihre  Haare  in  Ordnung \r\nunter  das  Netz  gebracht.  Je  mehr  ich  sie  ansah  und  mit \r\nihrer  Mutter  verghch,  desto  auffallender  war  mir  der \r\nUnterschied  beider  Gestalten.  Eine  lebhafte,  gesunde  Sinn- \r\nlichkeit blickte  aus  der  ganzen  Bildung  der  Tochter  her- \r\nvor; sie  mochte  eine  Frau  von  vierzig  Jahren  sein.  Mit \r\nmuntern  blauen  Augen  sah  sie  klug  umher,  ohne  daß  ich \r\nin  ihrem  Blick  irgend  einen  Argwohn  spüren  konnte.  In- \r\ndem sie  saß,  versprach  ihre  Figur  mehr  Länge,  als  sie \r\nzeigte,  wenn  sie  aufstand;  ihre  Stellung  war  determiniert, \r\nsie  saß  mit  vorwärts  gebogenem  Körper  und  die  Hände \r\nauf  die  Knie  gelegt.  Übrigens  erinnerte  mich  ihre  mehr \r\nstumpfe  als  scharfe  Gesichtsbildung  an  das  Bildnis  ihres \r\nBruders,  das  wir  in  Kupfer  kennen.  Sie  fragte  mich  ver- \r\nschiedenes über  meine  Reise,  über  meine  Absicht,  Sizi- \r\nlien zu  sehen,  und  war  überzeugt,  daß  ich  gewiß  zurück- \r\nkommen und  das  Fest  der  heiligen  Rosalie  mit  ihnen \r\nfeiern  würde. \r\n\r\nDa  indessen  die  Großmutter  wieder  einige  Fragen  an \r\nmich  getan  hatte  und  ich  ihr  zu  antworten  beschäftigt \r\nwar,  sprach  die  Tochter  halblaut  mit  meinem  Gefährten, \r\ndoch  so,  daß  ich  Anlaß  nehmen  konnte,  zu  fragen,  wo- \r\nvon die  Rede  sei.  Er  sagte  darauf,  Frau  Capitummino \r\nerzähle  ihm,  daß  ihr  Bruder  ihr  noch  vierzehn  Unzen \r\nschuldig  sei;  sie  habe  bei  seiner  schnellen  Abreise  von \r\nPalermo  versetzte  Sachen  für  ihn  eingelöset,  seit  der  Zeit \r\naber  weder  etwas  von  ihm  gehört,  noch  Geld  noch  irgend \r\neine  Unterstützung  von  ihm  erhalten,  ob  er  gleich,  wie \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  275 \r\n\r\nsie  höre,  große  Reichtümer  besitze  und  einen  fürstHchen \r\nAufwand  mache.  Ob  ich  nicht  über  mich  nehmen  wolle, \r\nnach  meiner  Zurückkunft  ihn  auf  eine  gute  Weise  an  die \r\nSchuld  zu  erinnern  und  eine  Unterstützung  für  sie  auszu- \r\nwirken, ja  ob  ich  nicht  einen  Brief  mitnehmen  oder  allen- \r\nfalls bestellen  wolle?  Ich  erbot  mich  dazu.  Sie  fragte, \r\nwo  ich  wohne,  wohin  sie  mir  den  Brief  zu  schicken  habe. \r\nIch  lehnte  ab,  meine  Wohnung  zu  sagen,  und  erbot  mich, \r\nden  andern  Tag  gegen  Abend  den  Brief  selbst  abzu- \r\nholen. \r\n\r\nSie  erzählte  mir  darauf  ihre  mißliche  Lage:  sie  sei  eine \r\nWitwe  mit  drei  Kindern,  von  denen  das  eine  Mädchen \r\nim  Kloster  erzogen  werde;  die  andere  sei  hier  gegen- \r\nwärtig und  ihr  Sohn  eben  in  die  Lehrstunde  gegangen. \r\nAußer  diesen  drei  Kindern  habe  sie  ihre  Mutter  bei  sich, \r\nfür  deren  Unterhalt  sie  sorgen  müsse,  und  überdies  habe \r\nsie  aus  cliristlicher  Liebe  die  unglückliche  kranke  Person \r\nzu  sich  genommen,  die  ihre  Last  noch  vergrößere;  alle \r\nihre  Arbeitsamkeit  reiche  kaum  hin,  sich  und  den  Ihrigen \r\ndas  Notdürftige  zu  verschaffen.  Sie  wisse  zwar,  daß  Gott \r\ndiese  guten  Werke  nicht  unbelohnt  lasse,  seufze  aber \r\ndoch  sehr  unter  der  Last,  die  sie  schon  so  lange  getra- \r\ngen habe. \r\n\r\nDie  jungen  Leute  mischten  sich  auch  ins  Gespräch,  und \r\ndie  Unterhaltung  wurde  lebhafter.  Indem  ich  mit  den \r\nandern  sprach,  hört  ich,  daß  die  Alte  ihre  Tochter  fragte, \r\nob  ich  denn  auch  wohl  ihi-er  heiligen  Religion  zugetan \r\nsei.  Ich  konnte  bemerken,  daß  die  Tochter  auf  eine \r\nkluge  Weise  der  Antwort  auszuweichen  suchte,  indem \r\nsie,  so  viel  ich  verstand,  der  Mutter  bedeutete,  daß  der \r\nFremde  gut  für  sie  gesinnt  zu  sein  schiene  und  daß  es \r\nsich  wohl  nicht  schicke,  jemanden  sogleich  über  diesen \r\nPunkt  zu  befragen. \r\n\r\nDa  sie  hörten,  daß  ich  bald  von  Palermo  abreisen  wollte, \r\nwurden  sie  dringender  und  ersuchten  mich,  daß  ich  doch \r\nja  wiederkommen  möchte;  besonders  rühmten  sie  die \r\npai-adiesischen  Tage  des  Rosalienfestes,  dergleichen  in \r\nder  ganzen  Welt  nicht  müsse  gesehen  und  genossen \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  7  6  ITyVLIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nMein  Begleiter,  der  schon  lange  Lust  gehabt  hatte,  sich \r\nzu  entfernen,  machte  endlich  der  Unterredung  durch \r\nseine  Gebärden  ein  Ende,  und  ich  versprach,  den  andern \r\nTag  gegen  Abend  wiederzukommen  und  den  Brief  ab- \r\nzuholen. Mein  Begleiter  freute  sich,  daß  alles  so  glücklich \r\ngelungen  sei,  und  wir  schieden  zufrieden  voneinander. \r\nMan  kann  sich  den  Eindruck  denken,  den  diese  arme, \r\nfromme,  wohlgesinnte  Familie  auf  mich  gemacht  hatte. \r\nMeine  Neugierde  war  befriedigt;  aber  ihr  natürliches  und \r\ngutes  Betragen  hatte  einen  Anteil  in  mir  erregt,  der  sich \r\ndurch  Nachdenken  noch  vermehrte. \r\nSogleich  aber  entstand  in  mir  die  Sorge  wegen  des  fol- \r\ngenden Tags.  Es  war  natürlich,  daß  diese  Erscheinung, \r\ndie  sie  im  ersten  Augenblick  überrascht  hatte,  nach  mei- \r\nnem Abschiede  manches  Nachdenken  bei  ihnen  erregen \r\nmußte.  Durch  den  Stammbaum  war  mir  bekannt,  daß \r\nnoch  mehrere  von  der  Famihe  lebten;  es  war  natürlich, \r\ndaß  sie  ihre  Freunde  zusammenberiefen,  um  sich  in  ihrer \r\nGegenwart  dasjenige  wiederholen  zu  lassen,  was  sie  Tags \r\nvorher  mit  Verwunderung  von  mir  gehört  hatten.  Meine \r\nAbsicht  hatte  ich  erreicht,  und  es  blieb  mir  nur  noch \r\nübrig,  dieses  Abenteuer  auf  eine  schickliche  Weise  zu \r\nendigen.  Ich  begab  mich  daher  des  andern  Tags  gleich \r\nnach  Tische  allein  in  ihre  Wohnung.  Sie  verwunderten \r\nsich,  da  ich  hineintrat.  Der  Brief  sei  noch  nicht  fertig, \r\nsagten  sie,  und  einige  ihrer  Verwandten  wünschten  mich \r\nauch  kennen  zu  lernen,  welche  sich  gegen  Abend  ein- \r\nfinden würden.  Ich  versetzte,  daß  ich  morgen  früh  schon \r\nabreisen  müsse,  daß  ich  noch  Visiten  zu  machen,  auch \r\neinzupacken  habe  und  also  lieber  früher  als  gar  nicht \r\nhätte  kommen  wollen. \r\n\r\nIndessen  trat  der  Sohn  herein,  den  ich  des  Tags  vorher \r\nnicht  gesehen  hatte.  Er  glich  seiner  Schwester  an  Wuchs \r\nund  Bildung.  Er  brachte  den  Brief,  den  man  mir  mit- \r\ngel)en  wollte,  den  er,  wie  es  in  jenen  Gegenden  gewöhn- \r\nlich ist,  außer  dem  Hause  bei  einem  der  öffentlich  sitzen- \r\nden Notarien  hatte  schreiben  lassen.  Der  junge  Mensch \r\nhatte  ein  stilles,  trauriges  und  bescheidenes  Wesen,  er- \r\nkundigte sich  nach  seinem   Oheim,   fragte  nach  dessen \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  277 \r\n\r\nReichtum  und  Ausgaben  und  setzte  traurig  hinzu,  warum \r\ner  seine  FamiHe  doch  so  ganz  vergessen  haben  möchte. \r\nEs  wäre  unser  größtes  Glück,  fuhr  er  fort,  wenn  er  ein- \r\nmal hieher  käme  und  sich  unserer  annehmen  wollte;  aber, \r\nfuhr  er  fort,  wie  hat  er  Ihnen  entdeckt,  daß  er  noch  An- \r\nverwandte in  Palermo  habe?  Man  sagt,  daß  er  uns  überall \r\nverleugne  und  sich  für  einen  Mann  von  großer  Geburt \r\nausgebe.  Ich  beantwortete  diese  Frage,  welche  durch  die \r\nUnvorsichtigkeit  meines  Führers  bei  unserm  ersten  Ein- \r\ntritt veranlaßt  worden  war,  auf  eine  Weise,  die  es  wahr- \r\nscheinlich machte,  daß  der  Oheim,  wenn  er  gleich  gegen \r\ndas  Publikum  Ursache  habe,  seine  Abkimft  zu  verbergen, \r\ndoch  gegen  seine  Freunde  und  Bekannte  kein  Geheimnis \r\ndaraus  mache. \r\n\r\nDie  Schwester,  welche  während  dieser  Unterredung  her- \r\nbeigetreten war  und  durch  die  Gegenwart  des  Bruders, \r\nwahrscheinlich  auch  durch  die  Abwesenheit  des  gestrigen \r\nFreundes  mehr  Mut  bekam,  fing  gleichfalls  an,  sehr  artig \r\nund  lebhaft  zu  sprechen.  Sie  baten  sehr,  sie  ihrem  Onkel, \r\nwenn  ich  ihm  schriebe,  zu  empfehlen;  ebenso  sehr  aber, \r\nwenn  ich  diese  Reise  durchs  Königreich  gemacht,  wie- \r\nderzukommen und  das  Rosalienfest  mit  ihnen  zu  be- \r\ngehen. \r\n\r\nDie  Mutter  stimmte  mit  den  Kindern  ein.  Mein  Herr, \r\nsagte  sie,  ob  es  sich  zwar  eigentlich  nicht  schickt,  da  ich \r\neine  erwachsene  Tochter  habe,  fremde  Männer  in  mei- \r\nnem Hause  zu  sehen,  und  man  Ursache  hat,  sich  sowohl \r\nvor  der  Gefahr  als  der  Nachrede  zu  hüten,  so  sollen  Sie \r\nuns  doch  immer  willkommen  sein,  wenn  Sie  in  diese \r\nStadt  zurückkehren. \r\n\r\nO  ja,  versetzten  die  Kinder;  wir  wollen  den  Herrn  beim \r\nFeste  herumführen,  wir  wollen  ihm  alles  zeigen,  wir \r\nwollen  uns  auf  die  Gerüste  setzen,  wo  wir  die  Feierlich- \r\nkeit am  besten  sehen  können.  Wie  wird  er  sich  über  den \r\ngroßen  Wagen  und  besonders  über  die  prächtige  Illumi- \r\nnation freuen! \r\n\r\nIndessen  hatte  die  Großmutter  den  Brief  gelesen  und \r\nwieder  gelesen.  Da  sie  hörte,  daß  ich  Abschied  nehmen \r\nwollte,  stand  sie  auf  und  übergab  mir  das  zusammen- \r\n\r\n\r\n2  7  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ngefaltete  Papier.  Sagen  Sie  meinem  Sohn,  fing  sie  mit \r\neiner  edlen  Lebhaftigkeit,  ja  einer  Art  von  Begeisterung \r\nan,  sagen  Sie  meinem  Sohn,  wie  glücklich  mich  die  Nach- \r\nricht gemacht  hat,  die  Sie  mir  von  ihm  gebracht  haben; \r\nsagen  Sie  ihm,  daß  ich  ihn  so  an  mein  Herz  schließe — \r\nhier  streckte  sie  die  Arme  auseinander  und  drückte  sie \r\nwieder  auf  ihrer  Brust  zusammen — daß  ich  täglich  Gott \r\nund  unsere  heilige  Jungfrau  für  ihn  im  Gebet  anflehe,  daß \r\nich  ihm  und  seiner  Frau  meinen  Segen  gebe  und  daß  ich \r\nnur  wünsche,  ihn  vor  meinem  Ende  noch  einmal  mit \r\ndiesen  Augen  zu  sehen,  die  so  viele  Tränen  über  ihn \r\nvergossen  haben. \r\n\r\nDie  eigne  Zierlichkeit  der  italienischen  Sprache  begün- \r\nstigte die  Wahl  und  die  edle  Stellung  dieser  Worte, \r\nwelche  noch  überdies  von  lebhaften  Gebärden  begleitet \r\nwurden,  womit  jene  Nation  über  ihre  Äußerungen  einen \r\nunglaublichen  Reiz  zu  verbreiten  gewohnt  ist. \r\nIch  nahm  nicht  ohne  Rührung  von  ihnen  Abschied.  Sie \r\nreichten  mir  alle  die  Hände,  die  Kinder  geleiteten  mich \r\nhinaus,  und  indes  ich  die  Treppe  hinunterging,  sprangen \r\nsie  auf  den  Balkon  des  Fensters,  das  aus  der  Küche  auf \r\ndie  Straße  ging,  riefen  mir  nach,  winkten  mir  Grüße  zu \r\nund  wiederholten,  daß  ich  ja  nicht  vergessen  möchte, \r\nwiederzukommen.  Ich  sah  sie  noch  auf  dem  Balkon  stehen, \r\nals  ich  um  die  Ecke  herumging. \r\n\r\nIch  brauche  nicht  zu  sagen,  daß  der  Anteil,  den  ich  an \r\ndieser  Familie  nahm,  den  lebhaften  Wunsch  in  mir  er- \r\nregte, ihr  nützlich  zu  sein  und  ihrem  Bedürfnis  zu  Hülfe \r\nzu  kommen.  Sie  war  nun  durch  mich  abermals  hinter- \r\ngangen und  ihre  Floffnungen  auf  eine  unerwartete  Hülfe \r\nwaren  durch  die  Neugierde  des  nördlichen  Europas  auf \r\ndem  Wege,  zum  zweitenmal  getäuscht  zu  werden. \r\nMein  erster  Vorsatz  war,  ihnen  vor  meiner  Abreise  jene \r\nvierzehn  Unzen  zuzustellen,  die  ihnen  der  Flüchtling \r\nschuldig  geblieben,  und  durch  die  Vermutung,  daß  ich \r\ndiese  Summe  von  ihm  wieder  zu  erhalten  hoflfte,  mein \r\nGeschenk  zu  bedecken;  allein  als  ich  zu  Hause  meine \r\nRechnung  machte,  meine  Kasse  und  Papiere  überschlug, \r\nsah  ich  wohl,   daß  in  einem  Lande,   wo  durch  Mangel \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  279 \r\n\r\nvon  Kommunikation  die  Entfernung  gleichsam  ins  Un- \r\nendliche wächst,  ich  mich  selbst  in  Verlegenheit  setzen \r\nwürde,  wenn  ich  mir  anmaßte,  die  Ungerechtigkeit  eines \r\nfrechen  Menschen  durch  eine  herzliche  Gutmütigkeit  zu \r\nverbessern. \r\n\r\nGegen  Abend  trat  ich  noch  zu  meinem  Handeismanne \r\nund  fragte  ihn,  wie  denn  das  Fest  morgen  ablaufen  werde, \r\nda  eine  große  Prozession  durch  die  Stadt  ziehen  und  der \r\nVizekönig  selbst  das  Heiligste  zu  Fuß  begleiten  solle. \r\nDer  geringste  Windstoß  müsse  ja  Gott  und  Menschen  in \r\ndie  dickste  Staubwolke  verhüllen. \r\n\r\nDer  muntere  Mann  versetzte,  daß  man  in  Palermo  sich \r\ngern  auf  ein  Wunder  verlasse.  Schon  mehrmals  in  ähn- \r\nlichen Fällen  sei  ein  gewaltsamer  Platzregen  gefallen  und \r\nhabe  die  meist  abhängige  Straße,  wenigstens  zum  Teil, \r\nrein  abgeschwemmt  und  der  Prozession  reinen  Weg  ge- \r\nbahnt. Auch  diesmal  hege  man  die  gleiche  Hoffnung \r\nnicht  ohne  Grund,  denn  der  Himmel  überziehe  sich  und \r\nverspreche  Regen  auf  die  Nacht. \r\n\r\nSonntag  den  15.  April. \r\nUnd  so  geschah  es  denn  auch:  der  gewaltsamste  Regen- \r\nguß fiel  vergangene  Nacht  vom  Himmel.  Sogleich  mor- \r\ngens eilte  ich  auf  die  Straße,  um  Zeuge  des  Wunders \r\nzu  sein.  Und  es  war  wirklich  seltsam  genug.  Der  zwi- \r\nschen den  beiderseitigen  Schrittsteinen  eingeschränkte \r\nRegenstrom  hatte  das  leichteste  Kehricht  die  abhängige \r\nStraße  herunter,  teils  nach  dem  Meere,  teils  in  die  Ab- \r\nzüge, insofern  sie  nicht  verstopft  waren,  fortgetrieben, \r\ndas  gröbere  Geströhde  wenigstens  von  einem  Orte  zum \r\nandern  geschoben  und  dadurch  wundersame,  reine  Mäan- \r\nder auf  das  Pflaster  gezeichnet.  Nun  waren  hundert  und \r\naber  hundert  Menschen  mit  Schaufeln,  Besen  und  Gabeln \r\ndahinterher,  diese  reinen  Stellen  zu  erweitern  und  in \r\nZusammenhang  zu  bringen,  indem  sie  die  noch  übrig- \r\ngebliebenen Unreinigkeiten  bald  auf  diese,  bald  auf  jene \r\nSeite  häuften.  Daraus  erfolgte  denn,  daß  die  Prozession, \r\nals  sie  begann,    wirklich  einen  reinlichen  Schlangenweg \r\n\r\n\r\n2  8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ndurch  den  Morast  gebahnt  sah  und  sowohl  die  sämtliche \r\nlangbekleidete  Geistlichkeit  als  der  nettfüßige  Adel,  den \r\nVizekönig  an  der  Spitze,  ungehindert  und  unbesudelt \r\ndurchschreiten  konnte.  Ich  glaubte  die  Kinder  Israel  zu \r\nsehen,  denen  durch  Moor  und  Moder  von  Engelshand  ein \r\ntrocknerPfad  bereitet  wurde,  und  veredelte  mir  in  diesem \r\nGleichnisseden  unerträglichen  Anblick,  so  viel  andachtige \r\nund  anständige  Menschen  durch  eine  Allee  von  feuchten \r\nKothaufen  durchbeten  und  durchprunken  zu  sehen. \r\nAuf  den  Schrittsteinen  hatte  man  nach  wie  vor  reinlichen \r\nWandel,  im  Innern  der  Stadt  hingegen,  wohin  uns  die \r\nAbsicht,  verschiedenes  bis  jetzt  Vernachlässigtes  zu  sehen, \r\ngerade  heute  gehen  hieß,  war  es  fast  unmöglich  durch- \r\nzukommen, obgleich  auch  hier  das  Kehren  und  Aufhäufen \r\nnicht  versäumt  war. \r\n\r\nDiese  Feierlichkeit  gab  uns  Anlaß,  die  Hauptkirche  zu \r\nbesuchen  und  ihre  Merkwürdigkeiten  zu  betrachten,  auch, \r\nweil  wir  einmal  auf  den  Beinen  waren,  uns  nach  andern \r\nGebäuden  umzusehen;  da  uns  denn  ein  maurisches,  bis \r\njetzt  wohlerhaltenes  Haus  gar  sehr  ergötzte.  Nicht  groß, \r\naber  mit  schönen,  weiten  und  wohlproportionierten,  har- \r\nmonischen Räumen;  in  einem  nördlichen  Klima  nicht \r\neben  bewohnbar,  im  südlichen  ein  höchst  willkommener \r\nAufenthalt.  Die  Baukundigen  mögen  uns  davon  Grund- \r\nund  Aufriß  überliefern. \r\n\r\nAuch  sahen  wir  in  einem  unfreundlichen  Lokal  verschie- \r\ndene Reste  antiker  marmorner  Statuen,  die  wir  aber  zu \r\nentziliern  keine  Geduld  hatten. \r\n\r\nMontag  den  i6.  April. \r\nDa  wir  uns  nun  selbst  mit  einer  nahen  Abreise  aus  diesem \r\nParadies  bedrohen  müssen,  so  hoffte  ich,  heute  noch  im \r\nötfentlichen  Garten  ein  vollkommenes  Labsal  zu  finden, \r\nmein  Pensum  in  der  Odyssee  zu  lesen  und  auf  einem \r\nSpaziergang  nach  dem  Tale,  am  Fuße  des  Rosalienbergs, \r\nden  Plan  der  Nausikaa  weiter  durchzudenken  und  zu  ver- \r\nsuchen, ob  diesem  Gegenstande  eine  dramatische  Seite \r\nabzugewinnen  sei.  Dies  alles  ist,  wo  nicht  mit  großem \r\nGlück,  doch  mit  vielem  Behagen  geschehen.    Ich  ver- \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  17  87  281 \r\n\r\nzeichnete  den  Plan  und  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  einige \r\nStellen,  die  mich  besonders  anzogen,  zu  entwerfen  und \r\nauszuführen. \r\n\r\nDienstag  dai  77.  April. \r\nEs  ist  ein  wahres  Unglück,  wenn  man  von  vielerlei \r\nGeistern  verfolgt  und  versucht  wird!  Heute  früh  ging \r\nich  mit  dem  festen,  ruhigen  Vorsatz,  meine  dichterischen \r\nTräume  fortzusetzen,  nach  dem  öffentlichen  Garten;  allein \r\neh  ich  mich's  versah,  erhaschte  mich  ein  anderes  Ge- \r\nspenst, das  mir  schon  diese  Tage  nachgeschlichen.  Die \r\nvielen  Pflanzen,  die  ich  sonst  nur  in  Kübeln  und  Töpfen, \r\nja  die  größte  Zeit  des  Jahres  nur  hinter  Glasfenstern  zu \r\nsehen  gewohnt  war,  stehen  hier  froh  und  frisch  unter \r\nfreiem  Himmel,  und  indem  sie  ihre  Bestimmung  voll- \r\nkommen erfüllen,  werden  sie  uns  deutlicher.  Im  Ange- \r\nsicht so  vielerlei  neuen  und  erneuten  Gebildes  fiel  mir \r\ndie  alte  Grille  wieder  ein,  ob  ich  nicht  imter  dieser  Schar \r\ndie  Urpflanze  entdecken  könnte.  Eine  solche  muß  es \r\ndenn  doch  geben!  Woran  würde  ich  sonst  erkennen,  daß \r\ndieses  oder  jenes  Gebilde  eine  Pflanze  sei,  wenn  sie  nicht \r\nalle  nach  einem  Muster  gebildet  wären? \r\nIch  bemühte  mich,  zu  untersuchen,  worin  denn  die  vielen \r\nabweichenden  Gestalten  voneinander  unterschieden  seien. \r\nUnd  ich  fand  sie  immer  mehr  ähnlich  als  verschieden, \r\nund  wollte  ich  meine  botanische  Terminologie  anbringen, \r\nso  ging  das  wohl,  aber  es  fruchtete  nicht,  es  machte  mich \r\nunruhig,  ohne  daß  es  mir  weiterhalf.  Gestört  war  mein \r\nguter  poetischer  Vorsatz;  der  Garten  des  Alkinous  war \r\nverschwunden,  ein  Weltgarten  hatte  sich  aufgetan.  War- \r\num sind  wir  Neueren  doch  so  zerstreut,  warum  gereizt \r\nzu  Forderungen,  die  wir  nicht  erreichen  noch  erfüllen \r\nkönnen! \r\n\r\nAlcamo,  Mittivoch  den  18.  April. \r\nBeizeiten  ritten  wir  aus  Palermo.  Kniep  und  der  Vettu- \r\nrin  hatten  sich  beim  Ein-  und  Aufpacken  vortrefflich  er- \r\nwiesen. Wir  zogen  langsam  die  herrliche  Straße  hinauf, \r\ndie  uns  schon  beim  Besuch  auf  San  Martino  bekannt  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\n282  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nworden,  und  bewunderten  abermals  eine  der  Pracht- \r\nfontänen am  Wege,  als  wir  auf  die  mäßige  Sitte  dieses \r\nLandes  vorbereitet  wurden.  Unser  Reitknecht  nämlich \r\nhatte  ein  kleines  Weinfäßchen  am  Riemen  umgehängt, \r\nwie  unsere  Marketenderinnen  pflegen,  und  es  schien  für \r\neinige  Tage  genugsam  Wein  zu  enthalten.  Wir  verwun- \r\nderten uns  daher,  als  er  auf  eine  der  vielen  Springröhren \r\nlosritt,  den  Pfropf  eröffnete  und  Wasser  einlaufen  Heß. \r\nWir  fragten,  mit  wahi-haft  deutschem  Erstaunen,  was  er \r\nda  vorhabe,  ob  das  Fäßchen  nicht  voll  Wein  sei.  Worauf \r\ner  mit  großer  Gelassenheit  erwiderte,  er  habe  ein  Drit- \r\nteil davon  leer  gelassen,  und  weil  niemand  ungemischten \r\nWein  trinke,  so  sei  es  besser,  man  mische  ihn  gleich  im \r\nganzen;  da  vereinigten  sich  die  Flüssigkeiten  besser,  und \r\nman  sei  ja  nicht  sicher,  überall  Wasser  zu  finden.  In- \r\ndessen war  das  Fäßchen  gefüllt,  und  wir  mußten  uns  diesen \r\naltorientalischen  Hochzeitsgebrauch  gefallen  lassen. \r\nAls  wir  nun  hinter  Monreale  auf  die  Höhen  gelangten, \r\nsahen  wir  wunderschöne  Gegenden,  mehr  im  historischen \r\nals  ökonomischen  Stil.  Wir  blickten  rechter  Hand  bis \r\nans  Meer,  das  zwischen  den  wundersamsten  Vorgebirgen \r\nüber  baumreiche  und  baumlose  Gestade  seine  schnur- \r\ngerade Horizontallinie  hinzog  und  so,  entschieden  ruhig, \r\nmit  den  wilden  Kalkfelscn  herrlich  kontrastierte.  Kniep \r\nenthielt  sich  nicht,  deren  in  kleinem  Format  mehrere  zu \r\numreißen.. \r\n\r\nNun  sind  wir  in  Alcamo,  einem  stillen,  reinlichen  Städt- \r\nchen, dessen  wohleingerichteter  Gasthof  als  eine  schöne \r\nAnstalt  zu  rühmen  ist,  da  man  von  hier  aus  den  abseits \r\nund  einsam  belegenen  Tempel  von  Segesta  bequem  be- \r\nsuchen kann. \r\n\r\nAlcamo^  Donnerstag  den  ig.  April. \r\nDie  gefällige  Wohnung  in  einem  ruhigen  Bergstädtchen \r\nzieht  uns  an,  und  wir  fassen  den  Entschluß,  den  ganzen \r\nTag  hier  zuzubringen.  Da  mag  denn  vor  allen  Dingen \r\nvon  gestrigen  Ereignissen  die  Rede  sein. \r\nSchon  früher  leugnete  ich  des  Prinzen  Pallagonia  Origi- \r\nnalität; er  hat  Vorgänger  gehabt  und  Muster  gefunden. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  283 \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Wege  nach  Monreale  stehen  zwei  Ungeheuer \r\nan  einer  Fontäne  und  auf  dem  Geländer  einige  Vasen, \r\nvöllig  als  wenn  sie  der  Fürst  bestellt  hätte. \r\nHinter  Monreale,  wenn  man  den  schönen  Weg  verläßt \r\nund  in  steinige  Gebirge  kommt,  liegen  oben  auf  dem \r\nRücken  Steine  im  Weg,  die  ich  ihrer  Schwere  und  An- \r\nwitterung  nach  für  Eisenstein  hielt.  Alle  Landesflächen \r\nsind  bebaut  und  tragen  besser  oder  schlechter.  Der  Kalk- \r\nstein zeigte  sich  rot,  die  verwitterte  Erde  an  solchen \r\nStellen  desgleichen.  Diese  rote,  tonig-kalkige  Erde  ist \r\nweit  verbreitet,  der  Boden  schwer,  kein  Sand  darunter, \r\nträgt  aber  trefi'Hchen  Weizen.  Wir  fanden  alte,  sehr  starke, \r\naber  verstümmelte  Ölbäume. \r\n\r\nUnter  dem  Obdach  einer  luftigen,  an  der  schlechten  Her- \r\nberge vorgebauten  Halle  erquickten  wir  uns  an  einem \r\nmäßigen  Imbiß.  Hunde  verzehrten  begierig  die  wegge- \r\nworfenen Schalen  unserer  Würste;  ein  Betteljunge  ver- \r\ntrieb sie  und  speiste  mit  Appetit  die  Schalen  der  Äpfel, \r\ndie  wir  verzehrten;  dieser  aber  ward  gleichfalls  von  einem \r\nalten  Bettler  verjagt.  Handwerksneid  ist  überall  zu  Hause. \r\nIn  einer  zerlumpten  Toga  lief  der  alte  Bettler  hin  und \r\nwider,  als  Hausknecht  oder  Kellner.  So  hatte  ich  auch \r\nschon  früher  gesehen,  daß,  wenn  man  etwas  von  einem \r\nWirte  verlangt,  was  er  grade  nicht  im  Hause  hat,  so  läßt \r\ner  es  durch  einen  Bettler  beim  Krämer  holen. \r\nDoch  sind  wir  gewöhnlich  vor  einer  so  unerfreulichen \r\nBedienung  bewahrt,  da  unser  Vetturin  vortrefflich  ist: \r\nStallknecht,  Cicerone,  Garde,  Einkäufer,  Koch  und  alles. \r\nAuf  den  höheren  Bergen  findet  sich  noch  immer  der  Öl- \r\nbaum, Caruba,  Fraxinus.  Ihr  Feldbau  ist  auch  in  drei \r\nJahre  geteilt.  Bohnen,  Getreide  und  Ruhe,  wobei  sie \r\nsagen:  Mist  tut  mehr  Wunder  als  die  Heiligen.  Der  Wein- \r\nstock wird  sehr  niedrig  gehalten. \r\n\r\nDie  Lage  von  Alcamo  ist  herrlich,  auf  der  Höhe,  in \r\neiniger  Entfernung  vom  Meerbusen;  die  Großheit  der \r\nGegend  zog  uns  an.  Hohe  Felsen,  tiefe  Täler  dabei, \r\naber  Weite  und  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Hinter  Monreale  rückt \r\nman  in  ein  schönes  doppeltes  Tal,  in  dessen  Mitte  sich \r\nnoch  ein  Felsrücken  herzieht.     Die   fruchtbaren  Felder \r\n\r\n\r\n2  8  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nstehen  grün  und  still,  indes  auf  dem  breiten  Wege  wildes \r\nGebüsch  und  Staudenmassen  wie  unsinnig  von  Blüten \r\nglänzt:  der  Linsenbusch,  ganz  gelb  von  Schmetterlings - \r\nblumen  überdeckt,  kein  grünes  Blatt  zu  sehen;  der  Weiß- \r\ndorn, Strauß  an  Strauß;  die  Aloes  rücken  in  die  Höhe \r\nund  deuten  auf  Blüten;  reiche  Teppiche  von  amarant- \r\nrotem Klee,  die  Insekten-Ophrys,  Alpenröslein,  Hya- \r\nzinthen mit  geschloßnen  Glocken,  Borraß,  Allien,  Aspho- \r\ndelen. \r\n\r\nDas  Wasser,  das  von  Segesta  herunterkommt,  bringt \r\naußer  Kalksteinen  viele  Hornsteingeschiebe;  sie  sind  sehr \r\nfest,  dunkelblau,  rot,  gelb,  braun,  von  den  verschieden- \r\nsten Schattierungen.  Auch  anstehend  als  Gänge  fand  ich \r\nHörn-  oder  Feuersteine  in  Kalkfelsen,  mit  Sahlband  von \r\nKalk.  Von  solchem  Geschiebe  findet  man  ganze  Hügel, \r\nehe  man  nach  Alcamo  kommt. \r\n\r\nScgcsia,  den  20.  April. \r\nDer  Tempel  von  Segesta  ist  nie  fertig  geworden,  und \r\nman  hat  den  Platz  um  denselben  nie  verglichen;  man \r\nebnete  nur  den -Umkreis,  worauf  die  Säulen  gegründet \r\nwerden  sollten:  denn  noch  jetzt  stehen  die  Stufen  an \r\nmanchen  Orten  neun  bis  zehn  Fuß  in  der  Erde,  und  es \r\nist  kein  Hügel  in  der  Nähe,  von  dem  Steine  und  Erd- \r\nreich hätten  herunterkommen  können.  Auch  liegen  die \r\nSteine  in  ihrer  meist  natürlichen  Lage,  und  man  findet \r\nkeine  Trümmer  darunter. \r\n\r\nDie  Säulen  stehen  alle;  zwei,  die  umgefallen  waren,  sind \r\nneuerdings  wieder  hergestellt.  Inwiefern  die  Säulen \r\nSockel  haben  sollten,  ist  schwer  zu  bestimmen  und  ohne \r\nZeichnung  nicht  deutlich  zu  machen.  Bald  sieht  es  aus, \r\nals  wenn  die  Säule  auf  der  vierten  Stufe  stände,  da  muß \r\nman  aber  wieder  eine  Stufe  zum  Innern  des  Tempels \r\nhinab;  bald  ist  die  oberste  Stufe  durchschnitten,  dann \r\nsieht  es  aus,  als  wenn  die  Säulen  Basen  hätten;  bald  sind \r\ndiese  Zwischenräume  wieder  ausgefüllt,  und  da  haben \r\nwir  wieder  den  ersten  Fall.  Der  Architekt  mag  dies  ge- \r\nnauer bestimmen. \r\nDie  Nebenseiten  haben  zwölf  Säulen  ohne  die  Ecksäulen, \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  285 \r\n\r\ndie  vordere  und  hintere  Seite  sechs  mit  den  Ecksäulen. \r\nDie  Zapfen,  an  denen  man  die  Steine  transportiert,  sind \r\nan  den  Stufen  des  Tempels  ringsum  nicht  weggehauen, \r\nzum  Beweis,  daß  der  Tempel  nicht  fertig  geworden.  Am \r\nmeisten  zeigt  davon  aber  der  Fußboden:  derselbe  ist  von \r\nden  Seiten  herein  an  einigen  Orten  durch  Platten  an- \r\ngegeben, in  der  Mitte  aber  steht  noch  der  rohe  Kalkfels \r\nhöher  als  das  Niveau  des  angelegten  Bodens;  er  kann \r\nalso  nie  geplattet  gewesen  sein.  Auch  ist  keine  Spur \r\nvon  innerer  Halle.  Noch  weniger  ist  der  Tempel  mit \r\nStuck  überzogen  gewesen;  daß  es  aber  die  Absicht  war, \r\nläßt  sich  vermuten:  an  den  Platten  der  Kapitale  sind  Vor- \r\nsprünge, wo  sich  vielleicht  der  Stuck  anschließen  sollte. \r\nDas  Ganze  ist  aus  einem  travertinähnlichen  Kalkstein  ge- \r\nbaut, jetzt  sehr  verfressen.  Die  Restauration  von  1781 \r\nhat  dem  Gebäude  selir  wohlgetan.  Der  Steinschnitt,  der \r\ndie  Teile  zusammenfügt,  ist  einfach,  aber  schön.  Die \r\ngroßen  besondern  Steine,  deren  Riedesel  erwähnt,  könnt \r\nich  nicht  finden;  sie  sind  vielleicht  zu  Restauration  der \r\nSäulen  verbraucht  worden. \r\n\r\nDie  Lage  des  Tempels  ist  sonderbar:  am  höchsten  Ende \r\neines  weiten  langen  Tales,  auf  einem  isolierten  Hügel, \r\naber  doch  noch  von  Klippen  umgeben,  sieht  er  über  viel \r\nLand  in  eine  weite  Ferne,  aber  nur  ein  Eckchen  Meer. \r\nDie  Gegend  ruht  in  trauriger  Fruchtbarkeit:  alles  bebaut \r\nund  fast  nirgends  eine  Wohnung.  Auf  blühenden  Disteln \r\nschwärmten  unzählige  Schmetterlinge.  Wilder  Fenchel \r\nstand,  acht  bis  neun  Fuß  hoch,  verdorrt,  von  vorigem \r\nJahr  her  so  reichlich  und  in  scheinbarer  Ordnung,  daß \r\nman  es  für  die  Anlage  einer  Baumschule  hätte  halten \r\nkönnen.  Der  Wind  sauste  in  den  Säulen  wie  in  einem \r\nWalde,  und  Raubvögel  schwebten  schreiend  über  dem \r\nGebälke. \r\n\r\nDie  Mühseligkeit,  in  den  unscheinbaren  Trümmern  eines \r\nTheaters  herumzusteigen,  benahm  uns  die  Lust,  die \r\nTrümmer  der  Stadt  zu  besuchen.  Am  Fuße  des  Tempels \r\nfinden  sich  große  Stücke  jenes  Hornsteins,  und  der  Weg \r\nnach  Alcamo  ist  mit  unendlichen  Geschieben  desselben \r\ngemischt.  Hiedurch  kommt  ein  Anteil  Kieselerde  in  den \r\n\r\n\r\n2  86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nBoden,  wodurch  er  lockerer  wird.  An  frischem  Fenchel \r\nbemerkte  ich  den  Unterschied  der  unteren  und  oberen \r\nBlätter,  und  es  ist  doch  nur  immer  dasselbe  Organ,  das \r\nsich  aus  der  Einfachheit  zur  Mannigfaltigkeit  entwickelt. \r\nMan  gätet  hier  sehr  fleißig;  die  Männer  gehen  wie  bei \r\neinem  Treibjagen  das  ganze  Feld  durch.  Insekten  lassen \r\nsich  auch  sehen.  In  Palermo  hatte  ich  nur  Gewürm  be- \r\nmerkt, Eidechsen,  Blutegel,  Schnecken  nicht  schöner  ge- \r\nfärbt als  unsere,  ja  nur  grau. \r\n\r\nCastel  Vetrano,  Sonnabend  den  21.  April. \r\nVon  Alcamo  auf  Castel  Vetrano  kommt  man  am  Kalk- \r\ngebirge her  über  Kieshügel.  Zwischen  den  steilen  un- \r\nfruchtbaren Kalkbergen  weite  hüglige  Täler,  alles  bebaut, \r\naber  fast  kein  Baum.  Die  Kieshügel  voll  großer  Ge- \r\nschiebe, auf  alte  Meeresströmungen  hindeutend;  der \r\nBoden  schön  gemischt,  leichter  als  bisher,  wegen  des \r\nAnteils  von  Sand.  Salemi  blieb  uns  eine  Stunde  rechts; \r\nhier  kamen  wir  über  Gipsfelsen,  dem  Kalke  vorliegend, \r\ndas  Erdreich  immer  treftlicher  gemischt.  In  der  Ferne \r\nsieht  man  das  westliche  Meer.  Im  Vordergrund  das  Erd- \r\nreich durchaus  hüglig.  Wir  fanden  ausgeschlagene  Feigen- \r\nbäume; was  aber  Lust  und  Bewunderung  erregte,  waren \r\nunübersehbare  Blumenmassen,  die  sich  auf  dem  über- \r\nbreiten Wege  angesiedelt  hatten  und  in  großen,  bunten, \r\naneinander  stoßenden  Flächen  sich  absonderten  und \r\nwiederholten.  Die  schönsten  Winden,  Hibiskus  und  Mal- \r\nven,  vielerlei  Arten  Klee  herrschten  wechselsweise,  da- \r\nzwischen das  Allium,  Galegagesträuche.  Und  durch  diesen \r\nbunten  Teppich  wand  man  sich  reitend  hindurch,  denen \r\nsich  kreuzenden  unzähligen  schmalen  Pfaden  nachfolgend. \r\nDazwischen  weidet  schönes  rotbraunes  Vieh,  nicht  groß, \r\nsehr  nett  gebaut;  besonders  zierliche  Gestalt  der  kleinen \r\nHörner. \r\n\r\nDie  Gebirge  in  Nordost  stehen  alle  reihenweis;  ein  ein- \r\nziger Gipfel,  Cuniglione,  ragt  aus  der  Mitte  hervor.  Die \r\nKieshügel  zeigen  wenig  Wasser,  auch  müssen  wenig \r\nRegengüsse  hier  niedergehen:  man  findet  keine  Wasser- \r\nrisse noch  sonst  Verschwemmtes. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  287 \r\n\r\nIn  der  Nacht  begegnete  mir  ein  eignes  Abenteuer.  Wir \r\nhatten  uns  in  einem  freihch  nicht  sehr  zierlichen  Lokal \r\nsehr  müde  auf  die  Betten  geworfen;  zu  Mitternacht  wach \r\nich  auf  und  erblicke  über  mir  die  angenehmste  Erschei- \r\nnung: einen  Stern  so  schön,  als  ich  ihn  nie  glaubte  ge- \r\nsehen zu  haben.  Ich  erquicke  mich  an  dem  lieblichen, \r\nalles  Gute  weissagenden  Anblick;  bald  aber  verschwindet \r\nmein  holdes  Licht  und  läßt  mich  in  der  Finsternis  allein. \r\nBei  Tagesanbruch  bemerkte  ich  erst  die  Veranlassung \r\ndieses  Wunders:  es  war  eine  Lücke  im  Dach,  und  einer \r\nder  schönsten  Sterne  des  Himmels  war  in  jenem  Augen- \r\nblick durch  meinen  Meridian  gegangen.  Dieses  natür- \r\nliche Ereignis  jedoch  legten  die  Reisenden  mit  Sicherheit \r\nzu  ihren  Gunsten  aus. \r\n\r\nSciacca,  Sonntag  den  22.  April. \r\nDerWeghieher,  mineralogisch  uninteressant,  geht  immer- \r\nfort über  Kieshügel.  Man  gelangt  ans  Ufer  des  Meers, \r\ndort  ragen  mitunter  Kalkfelsen  hervor.  Alles  flache  Erd- \r\nreich unendlich  fruchtbar,  Gerste  und  Hafer  von  dem \r\nschönsten  Stande;  Salsola  Kali  gepflanzt;  die  Aloes  haben \r\nschon  höhere  Fruchtstämme  getrieben  als  gestern  und \r\nehegestern.  Die  vielerlei  Kleearten  verließen  uns  nicht. \r\nEndlich  kamen  wir  an  ein  Wäldchen,  buschig,  die  höhe- \r\nren Bäume  nur  einzeln;  endlich  auch  Pantofifelholz! \r\n\r\nGirgenti,  den  2j.  April  abends. \r\nVon  Sciacca  hieher  starke  Tagreise.  Gleich  vor  ge- \r\nnanntem Orte  betrachteten  wir  die  Bäder;  ein  heißer \r\nQuell  dringt  aus  dem  Felsen,  mit  sehr  starkem  Schwefel- \r\ngeruch; das  Wasser  schmeckt  sehr  salzig,  aber  nicht  faul. \r\nSollte  der  Schwefeldunst  nicht  im  Augenblick  des  Her- \r\nvorbrechens sich  erzeugen?  Etwas  höher  ist  ein  Brunnen, \r\nkühl,  ohne  Geruch.  Ganz  oben  liegt  das  Kloster,  wo  die \r\nSchwitzbäder  sind;  ein  starker  Dampf  steigt  davon  in  die \r\nreine  Luft. \r\n\r\nDas  Meer  rollt  hier  nur  Kalkgeschiebe,  Quarz  und  Horn- \r\nstein  sind  abgeschnitten.  Ich  beobachtete  die  kleinen \r\nFlüsse:  Caltabellota  und  Macasoli  bringen  auch  nur  Kalk- \r\n\r\n\r\n2  88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ngeschiebe,  Platani  gelben  Marmor  und  Feuersteine,  die \r\newigen  Begleiter  dieses  edlern  Kalkgesteins.  Wenige \r\nStückchen  Lava  machten  mich  aufmerksam,  allein  ich \r\nvermute  hier  in  der  Gegend  nichts  Vulkanisches;  ich \r\ndenke  vielmehr,  es  sind  Trümmer  von  Mühlsteinen,  oder \r\nzu  welchem  Gebrauch  man  solche  Stücke  aus  der  Ferne \r\ngeholt  hat.  Bei  Monte  Allegro  ist  alles  Gips;  dichter \r\nGips  und  Fraueneis,  ganze  Felsen  vor  und  zwischen  dem \r\nKalk.    Die  wunderliche  Felsenlage  von  Caltabellota! \r\n\r\n\r\nGirgenti^  Dienstag  den  24.  April. \r\nSo  ein  herrlicher  Frühlingsblick  wie  der  heutige,  bei  auf- \r\ngehender Sonne,  ward  uns  freilich  nie  durchs  ganze \r\nLeben.  Auf  dem  hohen,  lualten  Burgraume  liegt  das  neue \r\nGirgenti,  in  einem  Umfang  groß  genug,  um  Einwohner \r\nzu  fassen.  Aus  unsern  Fenstern  erblicken  wir  den  weiten \r\nund  breiten  sanften  Abhang  der  ehemaligen  Stadt,  ganz \r\nvon  Gärten  und  Weinbergen  bedeckt,  unter  deren  Grün \r\nman  kaum  eine  Spur  ehemaliger  großer  bevölkerten  Stadt- \r\nquartiere vermuten  dürfte.  Nur  gegen  das  mittägige  Ende \r\ndieser  grünenden  und  blühenden  Fläche  sieht  man  den \r\nTempel  der  Concordia  hervorragen,  in  Osten  die  wenigen \r\nTrümmer  des  Junotempels;  die  übrigen,  mit  den  genann- \r\nten in  grader  Linie  gelegenen  Trümmer  anderer  heiligen \r\nGebäude  bemerkt  das  Auge  nicht  von  oben,  .sondern  eilt \r\nweiter  südwärts  nach  der  Strandiläche,  die  sich  noch  eine \r\nhalbe  Stunde  bis  gegen  das  Meer  erstreckt.  Versagt \r\nward  heute  uns  in  jene  so  herrlich  grünende,  blühende, \r\nfruchtversprechende  Räume  zwischen  Zweige  und  Ranken \r\nhinabzubegeben;  denn  unser  Fülirer,  ein  kleiner  guter \r\nWeltgeistlicher,  ersuchte  uns,  vor  allen  Dingen  diesen \r\nTag  der  Stadt  zu  widmen. \r\n\r\nErst  ließ  et  uns  die  ganz  wohlgebauten  Straßen  beschauen, \r\ndann  führte  er  uns  auf  höhere  Punkte,  wo  sich  der  An- \r\nblick durch  größere  Weite  und  ]>reite  noch  mehr  verherr- \r\nlichte, sodann  zum  Kunstgenuß  in  die  Hauptkirche. \r\nDiese  enthält  einen  wohlerhaltenen  Sarkophag,  zum  Altar \r\ngerettet:  Hippolyt  mit  seinen  Jagdgesellen  und  Pferden \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  289 \r\n\r\nwird  von  der  Amme  Phädras  aufgehalten,  die  ihm  ein \r\nTäfelchen  zustellen  will.  Hier  war  die  Hauptabsicht, \r\nschöne  Jünglinge  darzustellen;  deswegen  auch  die  Alte, \r\nganz  klein  und  zwergenhaft,  als  ein  Nebenwerk,  das \r\nnicht  stören  soll,  dazwischen  gebildet  ist.  Mich  dünkt, \r\nvon  halberhabener  Arbeit  nichts  Herrlichers  gesehen  zu \r\nhaben,  zugleich  vollkommen  erhalten.  Es  soll  mir  einst- \r\nweilen als  ein  Beispiel  der  anmutigsten  Zeit  griechischer \r\nKunst  gelten. \r\n\r\nIn  frühere  Epochen  wurden  wir  zurückgeführt  durch  Be- \r\ntrachtung einer  köstlichen  Vase  von  bedeutender  Größe \r\nund  vollkommener  Erhaltung.  Ferner  schienen  sich \r\nmanche  Reste  der  Baukunst  in  der  neuen  Kirche  hie  und \r\nda  untergesteckt  zu  haben. \r\n\r\nDa  es  hier  keine  Gasthöfe  gibt,  so  hatte  uns  eine  freund- \r\nliche Familie  Platz  gemacht  und  einen  erhöhten  Alkoven \r\nan  einem  großen  Zimmer  eingeräumt.  Ein  grüner  Vor- \r\nhang trennte  uns  und  unser  Gepäck  von  den  Hausgliedern, \r\nwelche  in  dem  großen  Zimmer  Nudeln  fabrizierten,  und \r\nzwar  von  der  feinsten,  weißesten  und  kleinsten  Sorte, \r\ndavon  diejenigen  am  teuersten  bezahlt  werden,  die,  nach- \r\ndem sie  erst  in  die  Gestalt  von  gliedslangen  Stiften  ge- \r\nbracht sind,  noch  von  spitzen  Mädchenfingern  einmal  in \r\nsich  selbst  gedreht,  eine  schneckenhafte  Gestalt  annehmen. \r\nWir  setzten  uns  zu  den  hübschen  Kindern,  ließen  uns  die \r\nBehandlung  erklären  und  vernahmen,  daß  sie  aus  dem \r\nbesten  und  schwersten  Weizen,  grano  forte  genannt, \r\nfabriziert  würden.  Dabei  kommt  viel  mehr  Handarbeit \r\nals  Maschinen-  und  Formwesen  vor.  Und  so  hatten  sie \r\nuns  denn  auch  das  trefflichste  Nudelgericht  bereitet,  be- \r\ndauerten jedoch,  daß  grade  von  der  allervoUkommensten \r\nSorte,  die  außer  Girgenti,  ja  außer  ihrem  Hause  nicht \r\ngefertigt  werden  könnte,  nicht  einmal  ein  Gericht  vor- \r\nrätig sei.  An  Weiße  und  Zartheit  schienen  diese  ihres- \r\ngleichen nicht  zu  haben. \r\n\r\nAuch  den  ganzen  Abend  wußte  unser  Führer  die  Unge- \r\nduld zu  besänftigen,  die  uns  hinabwärts  trieb,  indem  er \r\nuns  abermals  auf  die  Höhe  zu  herrlichen  Aussichtspunk- \r\nten führte  und  uns  dabei  die  Übersicht  der  Lage  gab  alle \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  19 \r\n\r\n\r\n2  90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  11 \r\n\r\nder  Merkwürdigkeiten,  die  wir  morgen  in  der  Nähe  sehen \r\nsollten. \r\n\r\nGirgenti,  Alithvoch  den  25.  April. \r\nMit  Sonnenaufgang  wandelten  wir  nun  hinunter,  wo  sich \r\nbei  jedem  Schritt  die  Umgebung  malerischer  anließ.  Mit \r\ndem  Bewußtsein,  daß  es  zu  unserm  Besten  gereiche, \r\nführte  uns  der  kleine  Mann  unaufhaltsam  (juer  durch  die \r\nreiche  Vegetation,  an  tausend  Einzelheiten  vorüber,  wo- \r\nvon jede  das  Lokal  zu  idyllischen  Szenen  darbot.  Hierzu \r\nträgt  die  Ungleichheit  des  Bodens  gar  vieles  bei,  der \r\nsich  wellenförmig  über  verborgene  Ruinen  hinbewegt, \r\ndie  um  so  eher  mit  fruchtbarer  Erde  überdeckt  werden \r\nkonnten,  als  die  vormaligen  Gebäude  aus  einem  leichten \r\nMuscheltuff  bestanden.  Und  so  gelangten  wir  an  das  öst- \r\nliche Ende  der  Stadt,  wo  die  Trümmer  des  Junotempels \r\njährlich  mehr  verfallen,  weil  eben  der  lockre  Stein  von \r\nLuft  und  Witterung  aufgezehrt  wird.  Heute  sollte  nur \r\neine  kursorische  Beschauung  angestellt  werden;  aber \r\nschon  wählte  sich  Kniep  die  Punkte,  von  welchen  aus  er \r\nmorgen  zeichnen  wollte. \r\n\r\nDer  Tempel  steht  gegenwärtig  auf  einem  verwitterten \r\nFelsen;  von  hier  aus  erstreckten  sich  die  Stadtmauern  ge- \r\nrade westwärts  auf  einem  Kalklager  hin,  welches  senk- \r\nrecht über  dem  flachen  Strande,  den  das  Meer,  frühfi \r\nund  später,  nachdem  es  diese  Felsen  gebildet  und  ihren \r\nFuß  bespült,  verlassen  hatte.  Teils  aus  den  Felsen  ge- \r\nhauen, teils  aus  denselben  erbaut  waren  die  Mauern, \r\nhinter  welchen  die  Reihe  der  Tempel  hervorragte.  Kein \r\nWunder  also,  daß  der  untere,  der  aufsteigende  und  der \r\nhöchste  Teil  von  Girgenti  zusammen  von  dem  Meere  her \r\neinen  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährte. \r\nDer  Tempel  der  Concordia  hat  so  vielen  Jahrhunderten \r\nwiderstanden;  seine  schlanke  Baukunst  nähert  ihn  schon \r\nunserm  Maßstabe  des  Schönen  und  Gefälligen:  er  ver- \r\nhält sich  zu  denen  von  Pästum  wie  Göttergcstalt  zum \r\nRiesenbilde.  Ich  will  mich  nicht  beklagen,  daß  der  neuere \r\nlöbliche  Vorsatz,  diese  Monumente  zu  erhalten,  ge- \r\nschmacklos ausgeführt  worden,  indem  man  die  Lücken \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  291 \r\n\r\nmit  blendend  weißem  Gips  ausbesserte ;  dadurch  steht \r\ndieses  Monument  auch  auf  gewisse  Weise  zertrümmert \r\nvor  dem  Auge;  wie  leicht  wäre  es  gewesen,  dem  Gips \r\ndie  Farbe  des  verwitterten  Steins  zu  geben!  Sieht  man \r\nfreilich  den  so  leicht  sich  bröckelnden  Muschelkalk  der \r\nSäulen  und  Mauern,  so  wundert  man  sich,  daß  er  noch \r\nso  lange  gehalten.  Aber  die  Erbauer,  hoftend  auf  eine \r\nähnliche  Nachkommenschaft,  hatten  deshalb  Vorkehrung \r\ngetroffen:  man  findet  noch  Überreste  eines  feinen  Tünchs \r\nan  den  Säulen,  der  zugleich  dem  Auge  schmeicheln  und \r\ndie  Dauer  verbürgen  sollte. \r\n\r\nDie  nächste  Station  ward  sodann  bei  den  Ruinen  des \r\nJupitertempels  gehalten.  Dieser  liegt  weit  gestreckt,  wie \r\ndie  Knochenmasse  eines  Riesengerippes,  inner-  und  un- \r\nterhalb mehrerer  kleinen  Besitzungen,  von  Zäunen  durch- \r\nschnitten, von  höhern  und  niedern  Pflanzen  durchwachsen. \r\nAlles  Gebildete  ist  aus  diesen  Schutthaufen  verschwun- \r\nden, außer  einem  ungeheueren  Triglyph  und  einem  Stück \r\neiner  demselben  proportionierten  Halbsäule.  Jenen  maß \r\nich  mit  ausgespannten  Armen  und  konnte  ihn  nicht  er- \r\nklaftern;  von  der  Kannelierung  der  Säule  hingegen  kann \r\ndies  einen  Begrifl\"  geben,  daß  ich,  darin  stehend,  die- \r\nselbe als  eine  kleine  Nische  ausfüllte,  mit  beiden  Schul- \r\ntern anstoßend.  Zweiundzwanzig  Männer  im  Kreise \r\nnebeneinander  gestellt,  würden  ohngefähr  die  Peripherie \r\neiner  solchen  Säule  bilden.  Wir  schieden  mit  dem  un- \r\nangenehmen Gefühle,  daß  hier  für  den  Zeichner  gar  nichts \r\nzu  tun  sei. \r\n\r\nDer  Tempel  des  Herkules  hingegen  ließ  noch  Spuren \r\nvormaliger  Symmetrie  entdecken.  Die  zwei  Säulenreihen, \r\ndie  den  Tempel  hüben  und  drüben  begleiteten,  lagen  in \r\ngleicher  Richtung,  wie  auf  einmal  zusammen  hingelegt, \r\nvon  Norden  nach  Süden,  jene  einen  Hügel  hinaufwärts, \r\ndiese  hinabwärts.  Der  Hügel  mochte  aus  der  zerfallenen \r\nZelle  entstanden  sein.  Die  Säulen,  wahrscheinlich  durch \r\ndas  Gebälk  zusammengehalten,  stürzten  auf  einmal,  viel- \r\nleicht durch  Sturmwut  niedergestreckt,  und  sie  liegen \r\nnoch  regelmäßig,  in  die  Stücke,  aus  denen  sie  zusammen- \r\ngesetzt waren,  zerfallen.  Dieses  merkwürdige  Vorkommen \r\n\r\n\r\n292  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ngenau  zu  zeichnen,  spitzte  Kniep  schon  in  Gedanken \r\nseine  Stifte. \r\n\r\nDer  Tempel  des  Äskulap,  von  dem  schönsten  Johan- \r\nnisbiotbaum  beschattet  und  in  ein  kleines  feldwirtschaft- \r\nliches Haus  beinahe  eingemauert,  bietet  ein  freundliches \r\nBild. \r\n\r\nNun  stiegen  wir  zum  Grabmal  Therons  hinab  und  er- \r\nfreuten uns  der  Gegenwart  dieses  so  oft  nachgebildet \r\ngesehenen  Monuments,  besonders  da  es  uns  zum  Vor- \r\ngrunde diente  einer  wundersamen  Ansicht;  denn  man \r\nschaute  von  Westen  nach  Osten  an  dem  Felslager  hin, \r\nauf  welchem  die  lückenhaften  Stadtmauern  sowie  durch \r\nsie  und  über  ihnen  die  Reste  der  Tempel  zu  sehen  waren. \r\nUnter  Hackerts  kunstreicher  Hand  ist  diese  Ansicht  zum \r\nerfreulichen  Bilde  geworden,  Kniep  wird  einen  Umriß \r\nauch  hier  nicht  fehlen  lassen. \r\n\r\nGi/genti,  Dimncrstag  den  26.  April. \r\nAls  ich  erwachte,  war  Kniep  schon  bereit,  mit  einem \r\nKnaben,  der  ihm  den  Weg  zeigen  und  die  Pappen  tragen \r\nsollte,  seine  zeichnerische  Reise  anzutreten.  Ich  genoß \r\ndes  herrlichsten  Morgens  am  Fenster,  meinen  geheimen, \r\nstillen,  aber  nicht  stummen  Freund  an  der  Seite.  Aus \r\nfrommer  Scheu  habe  ich  bisher  den  Namen  nicht  ge- \r\nnannt des  Mentors,  auf  den  ich  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  hin- \r\nblicke  und  hinhorche;  es  ist  der  treffliche  von  Riedesel, \r\ndessen  Büchlein  ich  wie  ein  Brevier  oder  Talisman  am \r\nBusen  trage.  Sehr  gern  habe  ich  mich  immer  in  solchen \r\nWesen  bespiegelt,  die  das  besitzen,  was  mir  abgeht;  und \r\nso  ist  es  grade  hier:  ruhiger  Vorsatz,  Sicherheit  des \r\nZwecks,  reinliche  schickliche  Mittel,  Vorbereitung  und \r\nKenntnis,  inniges  Verhältnis  zu  einem  meisterhaft  Be- \r\nlehrenden, zu  Winckelmann;  dies  alles  geht  mir  ab  und \r\nalles  übrige,  was  daraus  entspringt.  Und  doch  kann  ich \r\nmir  nicht  feind  sein,  daß  ich  das  zu  erschleichen,  zu  er- \r\nstürmen, zu  erlisten  suche,  was  mir  während  meines  Le- \r\nbens auf  dem  gewöhnlichen  Wege  ver.sagt  war.  Möge \r\njener  treft'liche  Mann  in  diesem  Augenblick  mitten  in \r\ndem  Weltgetümmel  empfinden,  wie  ein  dankbarer  Nach- \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  293 \r\n\r\nfahr  seine  Verdienste  feiert,  einsam  in  dem  einsamen \r\nOrte,  der  auch  für  ihn  so  viel  Reize  hatte,  daß  er  sogar, \r\nvergessen  von  den  Seinigen  und  ihrer  vergessend,  seine \r\nTage  hier  zuzubringen  wünschte. \r\n\r\nNun  durchzog  ich  die  gestrigen  Wege  mit  meinem  klei- \r\nnen geistlichen  Führer,  die  Gegenstände  von  mehrern \r\nSeiten  betrachtend  und  meinen  fleißigen  Freund  hie  und \r\nda  besuchend. \r\n\r\nAuf  eine  schöne  Anstalt  der  alten  mächtigen  Stadt  machte \r\nmich  mein  Führer  aufmerksam.  In  den  Felsen  und  Ge- \r\nmäuermassen, welche  Girgenti  zum  Bollwerk  dienten, \r\nfinden  sich  Gräber,  wahrscheinlich  den  Tapfern  und  Gu- \r\nten zur  Ruhestätte  bestimmt.  Wo  konnten  diese  schöner, \r\nzu  eigener  Glorie  und  zu  ewig  lebendiger  Nacheifrung, \r\nbeigesetzt  werden! \r\n\r\nIn  dem  weiten  Räume  zwischen  den  Mauern  und  dem \r\nMeere  finden  sich  noch  die  Reste  eines  kleinen  Tem- \r\npels, als  christliche  Kapelle  erhalten.  Auch  hier  sind \r\nHalbsäulen  mit  den  Quaderstücken  der  Mauer  aufs  schönste \r\nverbunden  und  beides  ineinander  gearbeitet;  höchst  er- \r\nfreulich dem  Auge.  Man  glaubt  genau  den  Punkt  zu  füh- \r\nlen, wo  die  dorische  Ordnung  ihr  vollendetes  Maß  er- \r\nhalten hat. \r\n\r\nManches  unscheinbare  Denkmal  des  Altertums  ward \r\nobenhin  angesehen,  sodann  mit  mehr  Aufmerksamkeit  die \r\njetzige  Art,  den  Weizen  unter  der  Erde  in  großen  aus- \r\ngemauerten Gewölben  zu  verwahren.  Über  den  bürger- \r\nlichen und  kirchlichen  Zustand  erzählte  mir  der  gute  Alte \r\ngar  manches.  Ich  hörte  von  nichts,  was  nur  einiger- \r\nmaßen in  Aufnahme  wäre.  Das  Gespräch  schickte  sich \r\nrecht  gut  zu  den  unaufhaltsam  verwitternden  Trümmern. \r\n\r\nDie  Schichten  des  Muschelkalks  fallen  alle  gegen  das \r\nMeer.  Wundersam  von  unten  und  hinten  ausgefressene \r\nFelsbänke,  deren  Oberes  und  Vorderes  sich  teilweise  er- \r\nhalten, so  daß  sie  wie  herunterhängende  Fransen  aus- \r\nsehen. Haß  auf  die  Franzosen,  weil  sie  mit  den  Bar- \r\nbaresken  Frieden  haben  und  man  ihnen  schuld  gibt,  sie \r\nverrieten  die  Christen  an  die  Ungläubigen. \r\n\r\n\r\n2  94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nVom  Meere  her  war  ein  antikes  Tor  in  Felsen  gehauen. \r\nDie  noch  bestehenden  Mauern  stufenweis  auf  den  Felsen \r\ngegründet.  Unser  Cicerone  hieß  Don  Michael  Vella, \r\nAntiquar,  wohnhaft  bei  Meister  Gerio  in  der  Nähe  von \r\nSanta  Maria. \r\n\r\nDiePufifbohnenzu  pflanzen,  verfahren  sie  folgendermaßen: \r\nsie  machen  in  gehöriger  Weite  voneinander  Löcher  in \r\ndie  Erde,  darein  tun  sie  eine  Handvoll  Mist,  sie  erwarten \r\nRegen,  und  dann  stecken  sie  die  Bohnen.  Das  Bohnen- \r\nstroh verbrennen  sie,  mit  der  daraus  entstehenden  Asche \r\nwaschen  sie  die  Leinwand.  Sie  bedienen  sich  keiner \r\nSeife.  Auch  die  äußern  Mandelschalen  verbrennen  sie \r\nund  bedienen  sich  derselben  statt  Soda.  Erst  waschen  sie \r\ndie  Wäsche  mit  Wasser  und  dann  mit  solcher  Lauge. \r\n\r\nDie  Folge  ihres  Fruchtbaus  ist:  Bohnen,  Weizen,  Tume- \r\nnia;  das  vierte  Jahr  lassen  sie  es  zur  Wiese  liegen.  Unter \r\nBohnen  werden  hier  die  Puft'bohnen  verstanden.  Ihr \r\nWeizen  ist  unendlich  schon.  Tumenia,  deren  Namen  sich \r\nvon  Bimenia  oder  Trimenia  herschreiben  soll,  ist  eine \r\nherrliche  Gabe  der  Ceres:  es  ist  eine  Art  von  Sommer- \r\nkorn, das  in  drei  Monaten  reif  wird.  Sie  säen  es  vom \r\nersten  Januar  bis  zum  Juni,  wo  es  denn  immer  zur  be- \r\nstimmten Zeit  reif  ist.  Sie  braucht  nicht  viel  Regen,  aber \r\nstarke  Wärme;  anfangs  hat  sie  ein  sehr  zartes  Blatt,  aber \r\nsie  wächst  dem  Weizen  nach  und  macht  sich  zuletzt  sehr \r\nstark.  Das  Korn  säen  sie  im  Oktober  und  November, \r\nes  reift  im  Juni.  Die  im  November  gesäte  Gerste  ist \r\nden  ersten  Juni  reif;  an  der  Küste  schneller,  in  Gebirgen \r\nlangsamer. \r\n\r\nDer  Lein  ist  schon  reif.  Der  Akanth  hat  seine  prächtigen \r\n\r\nBlätter  entfaltet.   Salsola  fruticosa  wächst  üppig. \r\n\r\nAuf  unbebauten  Hügeln  wächst  reichlicher  Esparsett.    Er \r\n\r\nwird  teilweis  verpachtet   und   bündelweis  in  die  Stadt \r\n\r\ngebracht.     Ebenso  verkaufen  sie  bündelweis  den  Hafer, \r\n\r\nden  sie  aus  dem  Weizen  ausgäten. \r\n\r\nSie  machen  artige  Einteilungen  mit  Rändchen  in  dem \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  295 \r\n\r\nErdreich,  wo  sie  Kohl  prianzen  wollen,  zum  Behuf  der \r\nWässerung. \r\n\r\nAn  den  Feigen  waren  alle  Blätter  heraus,  und  die  Früchte \r\nhatten  angesetzt.  Sie  werden  zu  Johanni  reif,  dann  setzt \r\nder  Baum  noch  einmal  an.  Die  Mandeln  hingen  sehr \r\nvoll;  ein  gestutzter  Karubenbaum  trug  unendliche  Scho- \r\nten. Die  Trauben  zum  Essen  werden  an  Lauben  ge- \r\nzogen, durch  hohe  Pfeiler  unterstützt.  Melonen  legen \r\nsie  im  März,  die  im  Juni  reifen.  In  den  Ruinen  des  Ju- \r\npitertempels wachsen  sie  munter  ohne  eine  Spur  von \r\nFeuchtigkeit. \r\n\r\nDer  Vetturin  aß  mit  größtem  Appetit  rohe  Artischocken \r\nund  Kohlrabi;  freilich  muß  man  gestehen,  daß  sie  viel \r\nzarter  und  saftiger  sind  als  wie  bei  uns.  Wenn  man  durch \r\nÄcker  kommt,  so  lassen  die  Bauern  zum  Beispiel  junge \r\nPufifbohnen  essen,  so  viel  man  will. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  auf  schwarze,  feste  Steine  aufmerksam  ward,  die \r\neiner  Lava  glichen,  sagte  mir  der  Antiquar,  sie  seien \r\nvom  Ätna;  auch  am  Hafen  oder  vielmehr  Landungsplatz \r\nstünden  solche. \r\n\r\nDer  Vögel  gibts  hier  zu  Lande  nicht  viel:  Wachteln.  Die \r\nZugvögel  sind:  Nachtigallen,  Lerchen  und  Schwalben. \r\nRinnine,  kleine  schwarze  Vögel,  die  aus  der  Levante  kom- \r\nmen, in  Sizilien  hecken  und  weiter  gehen  oder  zurück. \r\nRidene  kommen  im  Dezember  und  Januar  aus  Afrika, \r\nfallen  auf  dem  Akragas  nieder,  und  dann  ziehen  sie  sich \r\nin  die  Berge. \r\n\r\nVon  der  Vase  des  Doms  noch  ein  Wort.  Auf  derselben \r\nsteht  ein  Held  in  völliger  Rüstung,  gleichsam  als  An- \r\nkömmling, vor  einem  sitzenden  Alten,  der  durch  Kranz \r\nund  Zepter  als  König  bezeichnet  ist.  Hinter  diesem  steht \r\nein  Weib,  das  Haupt  gesenkt,  die  linke  Hand  unter  dem \r\nKinn;  aufmerksam-nachdenkende  Stellung.  Gegenüber \r\nhinter  dem  Helden  ein  Alter,  gleichfalls  bekränzt,  er \r\nspricht  mit  einem  spießtragenden  Manne,   der  von  der \r\n\r\n\r\n296  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nLeibwache  sein  mag.  Der  Alte  scheint  den  Helden  ein- \r\ngeführt zu  haben  und  zu  der  Wache  zu  sagen:  Laßt  ihn \r\nnur  mit  dem  König  reden,  es  ist  ein  braver  Mann.  Das \r\nRote  scheint  der  Grund  dieser  Vase,  das  Schwarze  dar- \r\nauf gesetzt.  Nur  an  dem  Frauengewande  scheint  Rot  auf \r\nSchwarz  zu  sitzen. \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  2'j.  April. \r\nWenn  Kniep  alle  Vorsätze  ausführen  will,  muß  er  unab- \r\nlässig zeichnen,  indes  ich  mit  meinem  alten  kleinen  Füh- \r\nrer umherziehe.  Wir  spazierten  gegen  das  Meer,  von  wo- \r\nher sich  Girgenti,  wie  uns  die  Alten  versichern,  sehr  gut \r\nausgenommen  habe.  Der  Blick  ward  in  die  Wellenweite \r\ngezogen,  und  mein  Führer  machte  mich  aufmerksam  auf \r\neinen  langen  Wolkenstreif,  der  südwärts,  einem  Berg- \r\nrücken gleich,  auf  der  Horizontallinie  aufzuliegen  schien: \r\ndies  sei  die  Andeutung  der  Küste  von  Afrika,  sagte  er. \r\nMir  fiel  indes  ein  anderes  Phänomen  als  seltsam  auf;  es \r\nwar  aus  leichtem  Gewölk  ein  schmaler  Bogen,  welcher, \r\nmit  dem  einen  Fuß  auf  Sizilien  aufstehend,  sich  hoch  am \r\nblauen,  übrigens  ganz  reinen  Himmel  hinwölbte  und  mit \r\ndem  andern  Ende  in  Süden  auf  dem  Meer  zu  ruhen \r\nschien.  Von  der  niedergehenden  Sonne  gar  schön  ge- \r\nfärbt und  wenig  Bewegung  zeigend,  war  er  dem  Auge \r\neine  so  seltsame  als  erfreuliche  Erscheinung.  Es  stehe \r\ndieser  Bogen,  versicherte  man  mir,  gerade  in  der  Rich- \r\ntung nach  Malta  und  möge  wohl  auf  dieser  Insel  seinen \r\nandern  Fuß  niedergelassen  haben;  das  Phänomen  komme \r\nmanchmal  vor.  Sonderbar  genug  wäre  es,  wenn  die  An- \r\nziehungskraft der  beiden  Inseln  gegeneinander  sich  in \r\nder  Atmosphäre  auf  diese  Art  kund  täte. \r\nDurch  dieses  Gespräch  ward  bei  mir  die  Frage  wieder \r\nrege,  ob  ich  den  Vorsatz,  Malta  zu  besuchen,  aufgeben \r\nsollte.  Allein  die  schon  früher  überdachten  Schwierig- \r\nkeiten und  Gefahren  blieben  noch  immer  dieselben,  und \r\nwir  nahmen  uns  vor,  unsern  Vetturin  bis  Messina  zu \r\ndingen. \r\n\r\nDabei  aber  sollte  wieder  nach  einer  gewissen  eigensinni- \r\ngen Grille  gehandelt  werden.   Ich  hatte  nämlich  auf  dem \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  297 \r\n\r\nbisherigen  Wege  in  Sizilien  wenig  kornreiche  Gegenden \r\ngesehen;  sodann  war  der  Horizont  überall  von  nahen \r\nund  fernen  Bergen  beschränkt,  so  daß  es  der  Insel  ganz \r\nan  Flächen  zu  fehlen  schien  und  man  nicht  begriff,  wie \r\nCeres  dieses  Land  so  vorzüglich  begünstigt  haben  sollte. \r\nAls  ich  mich  darnach  erkundigte,  erwiderte  man  mir, \r\ndaß  ich,  um  dieses  einzusehen,  statt  über  Syrakus  quer \r\ndurchs  Land  gehen  müsse,  wo  ich  denn  der  Weizenstriche \r\ngenug  antreffen  würde.  W' ir  folgten  dieser  Lockung,  Syra- \r\nkus aufzugeben,  indem  uns  nicht  unbekannt  war,  daß  von \r\ndieser  herrlichen  Stadt  wenig  mehr  als  der  prächtige \r\nName  geblieben  sei.  Allenfalls  war  sie  von  Catania  aus \r\nleicht  zu  besuchen. \r\n\r\nCalta/iisctta,  Sonnabend  den  28.  April. \r\nHeute  können  wir  denn  endlich  sagen,  daß  uns  ein  an- \r\nschaulicher Begriff  geworden,  wie  Sizilien  den  Ehren- \r\nnamen einer  Kornkammer  Italiens  erlangen  können.  Eine \r\nStrecke,  nachdem  wir  Girgenti  verlassen,  fing  der  frucht- \r\nbare Boden  an.  Es  sind  keine  großen  Flächen,  aber  sanft \r\ngegeneinander  laufende  Berg-  und  Hügelrücken,  durch- \r\ngängig mit  Weizen  und  Gerste  bestellt,  die  eine  ununter- \r\nbrochene Masse  von  Fruchtbarkeit  dem  Auge  darbieten. \r\nDer  diesen  Pflanzen  geeignete  Boden  wird  so  genutzt \r\nund  so  geschont,  daß  man  nirgends  einen  Baum  sieht, \r\nja  alle  die  kleinen  Ortschaften  und  Wohnungen  liegen \r\nauf  Rücken  der  Hügel,  wo  eine  hinstreichende  Reihe \r\nKalkfelsen  den  Boden  ohnehin  unbrauchbar  macht.  Dort \r\nwohnen  die  Weiber  das  ganze  Jahr,  mit  Spinnen  und \r\nWeben  beschäftigt,  die  Männer  hingegen  bringen  zur \r\neigentlichen  Epoche  der  Feldarbeit  nur  Sonnabend  und \r\nSonntag  bei  ihnen  zu;  die  übrigen  Tage  bleiben  sie \r\nunten  und  ziehen  sich  nachts  in  Rohrhütten  zurück.  Und \r\nso  war  denn  unser  W^unsch  bis  zum  Überdruß  erfüllt:  wir \r\nhätten  uns  Triptolems  Flügelwagen  gewünscht,  um  dieser \r\nEinförmigkeit  zu  entfliehen. \r\n\r\nNun  ritten  wir  bei  heißem  Sonnenschein  durch  diese \r\nwüste  Fruchtbarkeit  und  freuten  uns,  in  dem  wohlgelege- \r\nnen und  wohlgebauten  Caltanisetta  zuletzt  anzukommen, \r\n\r\n\r\n2  98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwo  wir  jedoch  abermals  vergeblich  um  eine  leidliche \r\nHerberge  bemüht  waren.  Die  Maultiere  stehen  in  präch- \r\ntig gewölbten  Ställen,  die  Knechte  schlafen  auf  dem \r\nKlee,  der  den  Tieren  bestimmt  ist,  der  Fremde  aber \r\nmuß  seine  Haushaltung  von  vorn  anfangen.  Ein  allen- \r\nfalls zu  beziehendes  Zimmer  muß  erst  gereinigt  werden. \r\nStühle  und  Bänke  gibt  es  nicht,  man  sitzt  auf  niedrigen \r\nBöcken  von  starkem  Holz;  Tische  sind  auch  nicht  zu \r\nfinden. \r\n\r\nWill  man  jene  Böcke  in  Bettfüße  verwandeln,  so  geht \r\nman  zum  Tischler  und  borgt  so  viel  Bretter,  als  nötig \r\nsind,  gegen  eine  gewisse  Miete.  Der  große  Juchtensack, \r\nden  uns  Hackert  geliehen,  kam  diesmal  sehr  zugute  und \r\nward  vorläufig  mit  Häckerling  angefüllt. \r\nVor  allem  aber  mußte  wegen  des  Essens  Anstalt  getroffen \r\nwerden.  Wir  hatten  unterwegs  eine  Henne  gekauft;  der \r\nVetturin  war  gegangen,  Reis,  Salz  und  Spezereien  anzu- \r\nschaffen: weil  er  aber  nie  hier  gewesen,  so  blieb  lange \r\nunerörtert,  wo  denn  eigentlich  gekocht  werden  sollte, \r\nwozu  in  der  Herberge  selbst  keine  Gelegenheit  war. \r\nEndlich  bequemte  sich  ein  ältlicher  Bürger,  Herd  und \r\nHolz,  Küchen-  und  Tischgeräte  gegen  ein  billiges  her- \r\nzugeben und  uns,  indessen  gekocht  würde,  in  der  Stadt \r\nherumzuführen,  endlich  auf  den  Markt,  wo  die  angesehn- \r\nsten  Einwohner  nach  antiker  Weise  umhersaßen,  sich \r\nunterhielten  und  von  uns  unterhalten  sein  wollten. \r\nWir  mußten  von  Friedrich  dem  Zweiten  erzählen,  und \r\nihre  Teilnahme  an  diesem  großen  Könige  war  so  lebhaft, \r\ndaß  wir  seinen  Tod  verhehlten,  um  nicht  durch  eine  so \r\nunselige  Nachricht  unsern  Wirten  verhaßt  zu  werden. \r\n\r\nGeologisches,  nachträglich.  Von  Girgenti  die  Muschel- \r\nkalkfelsen hinab  zeigt  sich  ein  weißliches  Erdreich,  das \r\nsich  nachher  erklärt:  man  findet  den  älteren  Kalk  wieder \r\nund  Gips  unmittelbar  daran.  Weite  flache  Täler,  Frucht- \r\nbau bis  an  die  Gipfel,  oft  darüber  weg:  älterer  Kalk  mit \r\nverwittertem  Gips  gemischt.  Nun  zeigt  sich  ein  loseres, \r\ngelbliches,  leicht  verwitterndes  neues  Kalkgestein;  in \r\nden  geackerten  Feldern  kann  man  dessen  Farbe  deutHch \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  299 \r\n\r\nerkennen,  die  oft  ins  Dunklere,  ja  ins  Violette  zieht. \r\nEtwas  über  halben  Weg  tritt  der  Gips  wieder  hervor. \r\nAuf  demselben  wächst  häufig  ein  schön  violettes,  fast \r\nrosenrotes  Sedum  und  an  den  Kalkfelsen  ein  schön  gel- \r\nbes Moos. \r\n\r\nJenes  verwitterliche  Kalkgestein  zeigt  sich  öfters  wieder, \r\nam  stärksten  gegen  Caltanisetta,  wo  es  in  Lagern  liegt, \r\ndie  einzelne  Muscheln  enthalten;  dann  zeigt  sichs  rötlich, \r\nbeinahe  wie  Mennige,  mit  wenigem  Violett,  wie  oben  bei \r\nSan  Martino  bemerkt  worden. \r\n\r\nQuarzgeschiebe  habe  ich  nur  etwa  auf  halbem  Wege  in \r\neinem  Tälchen  gefunden,  das,  an  drei  Seiten  geschlossen, \r\ngegen  Morgen  und  also  gegen  das  Meer  zu  offen  stand. \r\nLinks  in  der  Ferne  war  der  hohe  Berg  bei  Cammarata \r\nmerkwürdig  und  ein  anderer  wie  ein  gestutzter  Kegel. \r\nDie  große  Hälfte  des  Wegs  kein  Baum  zu  sehen.  Die \r\nFrucht  stand  herrlich,  obgleich  nicht  so  hoch  wie  zu \r\nGirgenti  und  am  Meeresufer,  jedoch  so  rein  als  möglich; \r\nin  den  unabsehbaren  Weizenäckern  kein  Unkraut.  Erst \r\nsahen  wir  nichts  als  grünende  Felder,  dann  gepflügte,  an \r\nfeuchtlichen  Örtern  ein  Stückchen  Wiese.  Hier  kommen \r\nauch  Pappeln  vor.  Gleich  hinter  Girgenti  fanden  wir \r\nÄpfel  und  Birnen,  übrigens  an  den  Höhen  und  in  der \r\nNähe  der  wenigen  Ortschaften  etwas  Feigen. \r\nDiese  dreißig  Miglien  nebst  allem,  was  ich  rechts  und \r\nlinks  erkennen  konnte,  ist  älterer  und  neuerer  Kalk,  da- \r\nzwischen Gips.  Der  Verwitterung  und  Verarbeitung  dieser \r\ndrei  untereinander  hat  das  Erdreich  seine  Fruchtbarkeit \r\nzu  verdanken.  Wenig  Sand  mag  es  enthalten,  es  knirscht \r\nkaum  unter  den  Zähnen.  Eine  Vermutung  wegen  des \r\nFlusses  Achates  wird  sich  morgen  bestätigen. \r\nDie  Täler  haben  eine  schöne  Form,  und  ob  sie  gleich \r\nnicht  ganz  flach  sind,  so  bemerkt  man  doch  keine  Spur \r\nvon  Regengüssen,  nur  kleine  Bäche,  kaum  merklich, \r\nrieseln  hin;  denn  alles  fließt  gleich  unmittelbar  nach  dem \r\nMeere.  Wenig  roter  Klee  ist  zu  sehen;  die  niedrige \r\nPalme  verschwindet  auch,  so  wie  alle  Blumen  und \r\nSträuche  der  südwestlichen  Seite.  Den  Disteln  ist  nur  er- \r\nlaubt, sich  der  \\^'ege  zu  bemächtigen;  alles  andere  gehört \r\n\r\n\r\n300  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nder  Ceres  an.  Übrigens  hat  die  Gegend  viel  Ähnliches \r\nmit  deutschen  hügeligen  und  fruchtbaren  Gegenden,  zum \r\nBeispiel  mit  der  zwischen  Erfurt  und  Gotha,  besonders \r\nwenn  man  nach  den  Gleichen  hinsieht.  Sehr  vieles  mußte \r\nzusammenkommen,  um  Sizilien  zu  einem  der  fruchtbar- \r\nsten Länder  der  Welt  zu  machen. \r\n\r\nMan  sieht  wenig  Pferde  auf  der  ganzen  Tour;  sie  pflügen \r\nmit  Ochsen,  und  es  besteht  ein  Verbot,  keine  Kühe  und \r\nKälber  zu  schlachten.  Ziegen,  Esel  und  Maultiere  begeg- \r\nneten uns  viele.  Die  Pferde  sind  meist  Apfelschimmel \r\nmit  schwarzen  Füßen  und  Mähnen;  man  findet  die  präch- \r\ntigsten Stallräume  mit  gemauerten  Bettstellen.  Das  Land \r\nwird  zu  Bohnen  und  Linsen  gedüngt,  die  übrigen  Feld- \r\nfrüchte  wachsen  nach  dieser  Sommerung.  In  Ähren \r\ngeschoßte,  noch  grüne  Gerste,  in  Bündeln,  roter  Klee \r\ndesgleichen  werden  dem  Vorbeireitenden  zu  Kauf  an- \r\ngeboten. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Berg  über  Caltanisetta  fand  sich  fester  Kalk- \r\nstein mit  Versteinerungen;  die  großen  Muscheln  lagen \r\nunten,  die  kleinen  obenauf.  Im  Pflaster  des  Städtchens \r\nfanden  wir  Kalkstein  mit  Pektiniten. \r\n\r\nHinter  Caltanisetta  senken  sich  die  Hügel  gäh  herunter \r\nin  mancherlei  Täler,  die  ihre  Wasser  in  den  Fluß  Salso \r\nergießen.  Das  Erdreich  ist  rötlich,  sehr  tonig;  vieles \r\nlag  unbestellt:  auf  dem  bestellten  die  Früchte  ziemlich \r\ngut,  doch,  mit  den  vorigen  Gegenden  verglichen,  noch \r\nzurück. \r\n\r\nCastro  Giovanni,  Sonntag  den  2g.  April. \r\nNoch  größere  Fruchtbarkeit  und  Menschenöde  hatten  wir \r\nheute  zu  bemerken.  Regenwetter  war  eingefallen  und \r\nmachte  den  Reisezustand  sehr  unangenehm,  da  wir  durch \r\nmehrere  stark  angeschwollene  Gewässer  hindurch  mußten. \r\nAm  Fiume  Salso,  wo  man  sich  nach  einer  Brücke  vergeb- \r\nlich umsieht,  überraschte  uns  eine  wunderliche  .Anstalt. \r\nKräftige  Männer  waren  bereit,  wovon  immer  zwei  und \r\nzwei  das  Maultier  mit  Reiter  und  Gepäck  in  die  Mitte \r\nfaßten  und  so,  durch  einen  tiefen  Stromteil  hindurch,  bis \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  17S7  301 \r\n\r\nauf  eine  große  Kiesflache  füiiiten;  war  nun  die  sämtliche \r\nGesellschaft  hier  beisammen,  so  ging  es  auf  eben  diese \r\nWeise  durch  den  zweiten  Arm  des  Flusses,  wo  die  Männer \r\ndenn  abermals,  durch  Stemmen  und  Drängen,  das  Tier \r\nauf  dem  rechten  Pfade  und  im  Stromzug  aufrecht  erhielten. \r\nAn  dem  Wasser  her  ist  etwas  Buschwerk,  das  sich  aber \r\nlandeinwärts  gleich  wieder  verliert.  Der  Fiume  Salso \r\nbringt  Granit,  einen  Übergang  in  Gneis,  breccierten  und \r\neinfarbigen  Marmor. \r\n\r\nNun  sahen  wir  den  einzeln  stehenden  Bergrücken  vor  uns, \r\nworauf  Castro  Giovanni  liegt  und  welcher  der  Gegend \r\neinen  ernsten,  sonderbaren  Charakter  erteilt.  Als  wir  den \r\nlangen,  an  der  Seite  sich  hinanziehenden  Weg  ritten,  fanden \r\nwir  den  Berg  aus  Muschelkalk  bestehend;  große,  nur  kal- \r\nzinierte Schalen  wurden  aufgepackt.  Man  sieht  Castro \r\nGiovanni  nicht  eher,  als  bis  man  ganz  oben  auf  den  Berg- \r\nrücken gelangt;  denn  es  liegt  am  Felsabhang  gegen  Norden. \r\nDas  wunderliche  Städtchen  selbst,  der  Turm,  links  in \r\neiniger  Entfernung  das  Örtchen  Caltascibetta  stehen  gar \r\nernsthaft  gegeneinander.  In  derPlaine  sah  man  die  Bohnen \r\nin  voller  Blüte.  Wer  hätte  sich  aber  dieses  Anblicks  er- \r\nfreuen können!  Die  Wege  waren  entsetzlich,  noch  schreck- \r\nlicher, weil  sie  ehemals  gepflastert  gewesen;  und  es  regnete \r\nimmerfort.  Das  alte  Enna  empting  uns  sehr  unfreundlich: \r\nein  Estrichzimmer  mit  Läden  ohne  Fenster,  so  daß  wir \r\nentweder  im  Dunkeln  sitzen  oder  den  Sprühregen,  dem \r\nwir  soeben  entgangen  waren,  wieder  erdulden  mußten. \r\nEinige  Überreste  unseres  Reisevorrats  wurden  verzehrt, \r\ndie  Nacht  kläglich  zugebracht.  Wir  taten  ein  feierliches \r\nGelübde,  nie  wieder  nach  einem  mythologischen  Namen \r\nunser  Wegeziel  zu  richten. \r\n\r\nMontag,  den  jo.  Apj-il. \r\nVon  Castro  Giovanni  herab  führt  ein  rauher,  unbequemer \r\nStieg;  wir  mußten  die  Pferde  führen.  Die  Atmosphäre \r\nvor  uns  tief  herab  mit  Wolken  bedeckt,  wobei  sich  ein \r\nwunderbar  Phänomen  in  der  größten  Höhe  sehen  ließ. \r\nEs  war  weiß  und  grau  gestreift  und  schien  etwas  Körper- \r\nliches zu  sein;  aber  wie  käme  das  Körperliche  in  den \r\n\r\n\r\n302  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nHimmel!  Unser  Führer  belehrte  uns,  diese  unsere  Ver- \r\nwunderung gelte  einer  Seite  des  Ätna,  welche  durch  die \r\nzerrissenen  Wolken  durchsehe:  Schnee  und  Bergrücken \r\nabwechselnd  bildeten  die  Streifen,  es  sei  nicht  einmal  der \r\nhöchste  Gipfel. \r\n\r\nDes  alten  Enna  steiler  Felsen  lag  nun  hinter  uns;  wir  zogen \r\ndurch  lange,  lange,  einsame  Täler;  unbebaut  und  unbe- \r\nwohnt lagen  sie  da,  dem  weidenden  Vieh  überlassen,  das \r\nwir  schön  braun  fanden,  nicht  groß,  mit  kleinen  Hörnern, \r\ngar  nett,  schlank  und  munter  wie  die  Hirschchen.  Diese \r\nguten  Geschöpfe  hatten  zwar  Weide  genug,  sie  war  ihnen \r\naber  doch  durch  ungeheure  Distelmassen  beengt  und  nach \r\nund  nach  verkümmert.  Diese  Pflanzen  finden  hier  die \r\nschönste  Gelegenheit,  sich  zu  besamen  und  ihr  Geschlecht \r\nauszubreiten;  sie  nehmen  einen  unglaublichen  Raum  ein, \r\nder  zur  Weide  von  ein  paar  großen  Landgütern  hinreichte. \r\nDa  sie  nicht  j)erennieren,  so  waren  sie  jetzt,  vor  der  Blüte \r\nniedergemäht,  gar  wohl  zu  vertilgen. \r\nIndessen  wir  nun  diese  landwirtlichen  Kriegsplane  gegen \r\ndie  Disteln  ernstlich  durchdachten,  mußten  wir  zu  unserer \r\nBeschämung  bemerken,  daß  sie  doch  nicht  ganz  unnütz \r\nseien.  Auf  einem  einsam  stehenden  Gasthofe,  wo  wir \r\nfütterten,  waren  zugleich  ein  paar  sizilianische  Edelleute \r\nangekommen,  welche  quer  durch  das  Land,  eines  Pro- \r\nzesses wegen,  nach  Palermo  zogen.  Mit  Verwunderung \r\nsahen  wir  diese  beiden  ernsthaften  Männer  mit  scharfen \r\nTaschenmessern  vor  einer  solchen  Distelgruppe  stehen \r\nund  die  obersten  Teile  dieser  emporstrebenden  Gewächse \r\nniederhauen;  sie  faßten  alsdann  diesen  stachligen  Ge- \r\nwinn mit  spitzen  Fingern,  schälten  den  Stengel  und  ver- \r\nzehrten das  Innere  desselben  mit  Wohlgefallen.  Damit \r\nbeschäftigten  sie  sich  eine  lange  Zeit,  indessen  wir  uns \r\nan  Wein,  diesmal  ungemischt,  und  gutem  Brot  enjuickten. \r\nDer  Vetturin  bereitete  uns  dergleichen  Stengelmark  und \r\nversicherte,  es  sei  eine  gesunde,  kühlende  Speise,  sie \r\nwollte  uns  aber  so  wenig  schmecken  als  der  rohe  Kohl- \r\nrabi zu  Segeste. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  303 \r\n\r\nUnterwegs. \r\nIn  das  Tal  gelangt,  wodurch  der  Fluß  San  Paolo  sich \r\nschlängelt,  fanden  wir  das  Erdreich  rötlich-schwarz  und \r\nverwitterlichen  Kalk;  viel  Brache,  sehr  weite  Felder, \r\nschönes  Tal,  durch  das  Flüßchen  sehr  angenehm.  Der \r\ngemischte  gute  Lehmboden  ist  mitunter  zwanzig  Fuß  tief \r\nund  meistens  gleich.  Die  Aloes  hatten  stark  getrieben. \r\nDie  Frucht  stand  schön,  doch  mitunter  unrein  und,  gegen \r\ndie  Mittagseite  berechnet,  weit  zurück.  Hie  und  da  kleine \r\nWohnungen;  kein  Baum  als  unmittelbar  unter  Castro  Gio- \r\nvanni. Am  Ufer  des  Flusses  viel  Weide,  durch  ungeheure \r\nDistelmassen  eingeschränkt.  Im  Flußgeschiebe  das  Quarz- \r\ngestein wieder,  teils  einfach,  teils  breccienartig. \r\nMolimenti,  ein  neues  Örtchen,  sehr  klug  in  der  INIitte \r\nschöner  Felder  angelegt,  am  Flüßchen  San  Paolo.  Der \r\nWeizen  stand  in  der  Nähe  ganz  unvergleichlich,  schon \r\nden  20.  Mai  zu  schneiden.  Die  ganze  Gegend  zeigt  noch \r\nkeine  Spur  von  vulkanischem  Wesen,  auch  selbst  der  Fluß \r\nführt  keine  dergleichen  Geschiebe.  Der  Boden,  gut  ge- \r\nmischt, eher  schwer  als  leicht,  ist  im  ganzen  kafFeebraun- \r\nviolettlich  anzusehen.  Alle  Gebirge  links,  die  den  Fluß \r\neinschließen,  sind  Kalk-  und  Sandstein,  deren  Abwechse- \r\nlung ich  nicht  beobachten  konnte,  welche  jedoch,  ver- \r\nwitternd, die  große,  durchaus  gleiche  Fruchtbarkeit  des \r\nuntern  Tales  bereitet  haben. \r\n\r\nDienstage  den  i.  Alai. \r\nDurch  ein  so  ungleich  angebautes,  obwohl  von  der  Natur \r\nzu  durchgängiger  Fruchtbarkeit  bestimmtes  Tal  ritten  wir \r\neinigermaßen  verdrießlich  herunter,  weil  nach  so  viel  aus- \r\ngestandenen Unbilden  unsern  malerischen  Zwecken  gar \r\nnichts  entgegenkam.  Kniep  hatte  eine  recht  bedeutende \r\nFerne  umrissen;  weil  aber  der  Mittel-  und  Vordergrund \r\ngar  zu  abscheulich  war,  setzte  er,  geschmackvoll  scher- \r\nzend, ein  Poussinsches  Vorderteil  daran,  welches  ihm \r\nnichts  kostete  und  das  Blatt  zu  einem  ganz  hübschen  Bild- \r\nchen machte.  Wie  viel  malerische  Reisen  mögen  der- \r\ngleichen Halbwahrheiten  enthalten! \r\n\r\n\r\n304  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nUnser  Reitmann  versprach,  um  unser  mürrisches  Wesen \r\nzu  begütigen,  für  den  Abend  eine  gute  Herberge,  brachte \r\nuns  auch  wirklich  in  einen  vor  wenig  Jahren  gebauten \r\nGasthof,  der  auf  diesem  Wege,  gerade  in  gehöriger  Ent- \r\nfernung von  Catania  gelegen,  dem  Reisenden  willkommen \r\nsein  mußte,  und  wir  ließen  es  uns.  bei  einer  leidlichen \r\nEinrichtung,  seit  zwölf  Tagen  wieder  einigermaßen  be- \r\nquem werden.  Merkwürdig  aber  war  uns  eine  Inschrift, \r\nan  die  Wand  bleistiftlich  mit  schönen  englischen  Schrift- \r\nzügen geschrieben;  sie  enthielt  folgendes:  \"Reisende,  wer \r\nihr  auch  seid,  hütet  euch  in  Catania  vor  dem  Wirtshause \r\nzum  goldenen  Löwen!  Es  ist  schlimmer,  als  wenn  ihr \r\nZyklopen,  Sirenen  und  Szyllen  zugleich  in  die  Klauen \r\nfielet.\"  Ob  wir  nun  schon  dachten,  der  wohlmeinende \r\nWarner  möchte  die  Gefahr  etwas  mythologisch  vergrößert \r\nhaben,  so  setzten  wir  uns  doch  fest  vor,  den  goldenen \r\nLöwen  zu  vermeiden,  der  uns  als  ein  so  grimmiges  Tier \r\nangekündigt  war.  Als  uns  daher  der  Maultiertreibende \r\nbefragte,  wo  wir  in  Catania  einkehren  wollten,  so  ver- \r\nsetzten wir:  Überall,  nur  nicht  im  Löwen!  Worauf  er  den \r\nVorschlag  tat,  da  vorlieb  zu  nehmen,  wo  er  seine  Tiere \r\nunterstelle;  nur  müßten  wir  uns  daselbst  auch  verköstigen, \r\nwie  wir  es  schon  bisher  getan.  Wir  waren  alles  zufrieden; \r\ndem  Rachen  des  Löwen  zu  entgehen,  war  unser  einziger \r\nWunsch. \r\n\r\nGegen  Hybla  Major  melden  sich  Lavageschiebe,  welche \r\ndas  Wasser  von  Norden  herunter  bringt.  Über  der  Fähre \r\nfindet  man  Kalkstein,  welcher  allerlei  Arten  Geschiebe, \r\nHornstein,  Lava  und  Kalk  verbunden  hat,  dann  verhärtete \r\nvulkanische  Asche,  mit  Kalktuftüberzogen.  Die  gemischten \r\nKieshügel  dauern  immer  fort  bis  gegen  Catania;  bis  an \r\ndieselben  und  über  dieselben  finden  sich  Lavaströme  des \r\nÄtna.  Einen  wahrscheinlichen  Krater  läßt  man  links. \r\n(Gleich  unter  Molimenti  rauften  die  Bauern  den  Flachs.) \r\nWie  die  Natur  das  Bunte  liebt,  läßt  sie  hier  sehen,  wo  sie \r\nsich  an  der  schwarz-blau-grauen  Lava  erlustigt:  hoch- \r\ngelbes Moos  überzieht  sie,  ein  schön  rotes  Sedum  wächst \r\nüppig  darauf,  andere  schöne  violette  Blumen.  Eine  sorg- \r\nsame Kultur  beweist  sich  an  den  Kaktuspflanzungen  und \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  505 \r\n\r\nVVeinranken.  Nun  drängen  sich  ungeheuere  Lavaflüsse \r\nheran.  Motta  ist  ein  schöner  bedeutender  Fels.  Hier  stehen \r\ndie  Bohnen  als  sehr  hohe  Stauden.  Die  Äcker  sind  ver- \r\nänderlich, bald  sehr  kiesig,  bald  besser  gemischt. \r\nDer  Vetturin,  der  diese  Frühlingsvegetation  der  Südost- \r\nseite lange  nicht  gesehen  haben  mochte,  verfiel  in  großes \r\nAusrufen  über  die  Schönheit  der  Frucht  und  fragte  uns \r\nmit  selbstgefälligem  Patriotismus,  ob  es  in  imsern  Landen \r\nauch  wohl  solche  gäbe.  Ihr  ist  hier  alles  aufgeopfert;  man \r\nsieht  wenig,  ja  gar  keine  Bäume.  Allerliebst  war  ein \r\nMädchen  von  prächtiger,  schlanker  Gestalt,  eine  ältere \r\nBekanntschaft  unseres  Vetturins,  die  seinem  Maultiere \r\ngleichlief,  schwatzte  und  dabei  mit  solcher  Zierlichkeit \r\nals  möglich  ihren  Faden  spann.  Nun  fingen  gelbe  Blumen \r\nzu  herrschen  an.  Gegen  Misterbianco  standen  die  Kaktus \r\nschon  wieder  in  Zäunen;  Zäune  aber,  ganz  von  diesen \r\nwundersam  gebildeten  Gewächsen,  werden  in  der  Nähe \r\nvon  Catania  immer  regelmäßiger  und  schöner. \r\n\r\nCatania,  Mittwoch  den  2.  Mai. \r\nIn  unserer  Herberge  befanden  wir  uns  freilich  sehr  übel. \r\nDie  Kost,  wie  sie  der  Maultierknecht  bereiten  konnte, \r\nwar  nicht  die  beste.  Eine  Henne,  in  Reis  gekocht,  wäre \r\ndennoch  nicht  zu  verachten  gewesen,  hätte  sie  nicht  ein \r\nunmäßiger  Safran  so  gelb  als  ungenießbar  gemacht.  Das  un- \r\nbequemste Nachtlager  hätte  uns  beinahe  genötigt,  Hackerts \r\nJuchtensack  wieder  hervorzuholen;  deshalb  sprachen  wir \r\nmorgens  zeitig  mit  dem  freundlichen  Wirte.  Er  bedauerte, \r\ndaß  er  uns  nicht  besser  versorgen  könne:  da  drüben  aber \r\nist  ein  Haus,  wo  Fremde  gut  aufgehoben  sind  und  alle \r\nUrsache  haben,  zufrieden  zu  sein.  Er  zeigte  uns  ein  großes \r\nEckhaus,  von  welchem  die  uns  zugekehrte  Seite  viel  Gutes \r\nversprach.  Wir  eilten  sogleich  hinüber,  fanden  einen  rüh- \r\nrigen Mann,  der  sich  als  Lohnbedienter  angab  und,  in \r\nAbwesenheit  des  Wirts,  uns  ein  schönes  Zimmer  neben \r\neinem  Saal  anwies,  auch  zugleich  versicherte,  daß  wir \r\naufs  billigste  bedient  werden  sollten.  Wir  erkundigten \r\nuns  ungesäumt  hergebrachterweise,  was  für  Quartier, Tisch, \r\nWein,  Frühstück  und  sonstiges  Bestimmbare  zu  bezahlen \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  20 \r\n\r\n\r\n3o6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nsei.  Das  war  alles  billig,  und  wir  schauten  eilig  unsere \r\nWenigkeiten  herüber,  sie  in  die  weitläufigen  vergoldeten \r\nKommoden  einzuordnen.  Kniep  fand  zum  ersten  Male \r\nGelegenheit,  seine  Pappe  auszubreiten;  er  ordnete  seine \r\nZeichnungen,  ich  mein  Bemerktes.  Sodann,  vergnügt  über \r\ndie  schönen  Räume,  traten  wir  auf  den  Balkon  des  Saals, \r\nder  Aussicht  zu  genießen.  Nachdem  wir  diese  genugsam \r\nbetrachtet  und  gelobt,  kehrten  wir  um  nach  unsern  Ge- \r\nschäften, und  siehe!  da  drohte  über  unserm  Haupte  ein \r\ngroßer  goldner  Löwe.  Wir  sahen  einander  bedenklich \r\nan,  lächelten  und  lachten.  Von  nun  an  aber  blickten  wir \r\numher,  ob  nicht  irgendwo  eins  der  Homerischen  Schreck- \r\nbilder hervorschauen  möchte. \r\n\r\nNichts  dergleichen  war  zu  sehen;  dagegen  fanden  wir  im \r\nSaal  eine  hübsche,  junge  Frau,  die  mit  einem  Kinde  von \r\netwa  zwei  Jahren  herumtändelte,  aber  sogleich  von  dem \r\nbeweglichen  Halbwirt  derb  ausgescholten  dastand:  sie \r\nsolle  sich  hinweg  verfügen,  hieß  es;  sie  habe  hier  nichts \r\nzu  tun.  Es  ist  doch  hart,  daß  du  mich  fortjagst,  sagte  sie; \r\ndas  Kind  ist  zu  Hause  nicht  zu  begütigen,  wenn  du  wet; \r\nbist,  und  die  Herrn  erlauben  mir  gewiß,  in  deiner  Gegen- \r\nwart das  Kleine  zu  beruhigen.  Der  Gemahl  ließ  es  dabei \r\nnicht  bewenden,  sondern  suchte  sie  fortzuschaffen;  das \r\nKind  schrie  in  der  Türe  ganz  erbärmlich,  und  wir  mußten \r\nzuletzt  ernstlich  verlangen,  daß  das  hübsche  Madamchen \r\ndabliebe. \r\n\r\nDurch  den  Engländer  gewarnt,  war  es  keine  Kunst,  die \r\nKomödie  zu  durchschauen;  wir  spielten  die  Neulinge,  die \r\nUnschuldigen,  er  aber  machte  seine  liebreiche  Vaterschaft \r\nauf  das  beste  gelten.  Das  Kind  wirklich  war  am  freund- \r\nlichsten mit  ihm,  wahrscheinlich  hatte  es  die  angebliche \r\nMutter  unter  der  Türe  gekneipt. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  war  sie  auch  in  der  größten  Unschuld  dageblieben, \r\nals  der  Mann  wegging,  ein  Empfehlungsschreiben  an  den \r\nHausgeistlichen  des  Prinzen  Biscari  zu  überbringen.  Sie \r\ndahlte  fort,  bis  er  zurückkam  und  anzeigte,  der  Abh6 \r\nwürde  selbst  erscheinen,  uns  von  dem  Näheren  zu  unter- \r\nrichten. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  307 \r\n\r\nDonnerstag^  d'U  3.  Mai. \r\nDer  Abbe,  der  uns  gestern  abend  schon  begrüßt  hatte, \r\nerschien  heute  zeitig  und  führte  uns  in  den  Palast,  welcher \r\nauf  einem  hohen  Sockel  einstöckig  gebaut  ist;  und  zwar \r\nsahen  wir  zuerst  das  Museum,  wo  marmorne  und  eherne \r\nBilder,  Vasen  und  alle  Arten  solcherAltertümer  beisammen- \r\nstehen. Wir  hatten  abermals  Gelegenheit,  unsere  Kennt- \r\nnisse zu  erweitern,  besonders  aber  fesselte  uns  der  Sturz \r\neines  Jupiters,  dessen  Abguß  ich  schon  aus  Tischbeins \r\nWerkstatt  kannte  und  welcher  größere  Vorzüge  besitzt, \r\nals  wir  zu  beurteilen  vermochten.  Ein  Hausgenosse  gab \r\ndie  nötigste  historische  Auskunft,  und  nun  gelangten  wir \r\nin  einen  großen  hohen  Saal.  Die  vielen  Stühle  an  den \r\nWänden  umher  zeugten,  daß  große  Gesellschaft  sich \r\nmanchmal  hier  versammle.  Wir  setzten  uns  in  Erwartung \r\neiner  günstigen  Aufnahme.  Da  kamen  ein  paar  Frauen- \r\nzimmer herein  und  gingen  der  Länge  nach  auf  und  ab. \r\nSie  sprachen  angelegentlich  miteinander.  Als  sie  uns  ge- \r\nwahrten, stand  der  Abbe  auf,  ich  desgleichen;  wir  neigten \r\nuns.  Ich  fragte,  wer  sie  seien,  und  erfuhr,  die  jüngere \r\nsei  die  Prinzessin,  die  ältere  eine  edle  Catanierin.  Wir \r\nhatten  uns  wieder  gesetzt,  sie  gingen  auf  und  ab,  wie  man \r\nauf  einem  Marktplatze  tun  würde. \r\n\r\nWir  wurden  zum  Prinzen  geführt,  der,  wie  man  mir  schon \r\nbemerkt  hatte,  uns  seine  Münzsammlung  aus  besonderem \r\nVertrauen  vorwies,  da  wohl  früher  seinem  Herrn  Vater \r\nund  auch  ihm  nachher  bei  solchem  Vorzeigen  manches \r\nabhanden  gekommen  und  seine  gewöhnliche  Bereitwillig- \r\nkeit dadurch  einigermaßen  vermindert  worden.  Hier \r\nkonnte  ich  nun  schon  etwas  kenntnisreicher  scheinen, \r\nindem  ich  mich  bei  Betrachtung  der  Sammlung  des  Prin- \r\nzen Torremuzza  belehrt  hatte.  Ich  lernte  wieder  und  half \r\nmir  an  jenem  dauerhaften  Winckelmannischen  Faden,  der \r\nuns  durch  die  verschiedenen  Kunstepochen  durchleitet, \r\nso  ziemHch  hin.  Der  Prinz,  von  diesen  Dingen  völlig \r\nunterrichtet,  da  er  keine  Kenner,  aber  aufmerksame  Lieb- \r\nhaber vor  sich  sah,  mochte  uns  gern  in  allem,  wonach \r\nwir  forschten,  belehren. \r\n\r\n\r\n3o8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nNachdem  wir  diesen  Betrachtungen  geraume  Zeit,  aber \r\ndoch  noch  immer  zu  wenig  gewithnet,  standen  wir  im \r\nBegrift',  uns  zu  beurlauben,  als  er  uns  zu  seiner  Frau \r\nMutter  führte,  woselbst  die  übrigen  kleinern  Kunstwerke \r\nzu  sehen  waren. \r\n\r\nWir  fanden  eine  ansehnliche,  natürlich-edle  Frau,  die \r\nuns  mit  den  Worten  empfing:  Sehen  Sie  sich  bei  mir  um, \r\nmeine  Herrn,  Sie  finden  hier  alles  noch,  wie  es  mein \r\nseliger  Gemahl  gesammelt  und  geordnet  hat.  Dies  danke \r\nich  der  Frömmigkeit  meines  Sohnes,  der  mich  in  seinen \r\nbesten  Zimmern  nicht  nur  wohnen,  sondern  auch  hier \r\nnicht  das  geringste  entfernen  oder  verrücken  läßt,  was \r\nsein  seliger  Herr  Vater  anschaffte  und  aufstellte;  wodurch \r\nich  den  doppelten  Vorteil  habe,  sowohl  auf  die  so  lange \r\nJahre  her  gewohnte  Weise  zu  leben,  als  auch,  wie  von \r\njeher,  die  trefflichen  Fremden  zu  sehen  und  näher  zu \r\nkennen,  die,  unsere  Schätze  zu  betrachten,  von  so  weiten \r\nOrten  herkommen. \r\n\r\nSie  schloß  uns  darauf  selbst  den  Glasschrank  auf,  worin \r\ndie  Arbeiten  in  Bernstein  aufbewahrt  standen.  Der  sizi- \r\nlianische  unterscheidet  sich  von  dem  nordischen  darin, \r\ndaß  er  von  der  durchsichtigen  und  undurchsichtigen \r\nWachs-  und  Honigfarbe  durch  alle  Abschattungen  eines \r\ngesättigten  Gelbs  bis  zum  schönsten  Hyazinthrot  hinan- \r\nsteigt. Urnen,  Becher  und  andere  Dinge  waren  daraus \r\ngeschnitten,  wozu  man  große  bewundernswürdige  Stücke \r\ndes  Materials  mitunter  voraussetzen  mußte.  An  diesen \r\nGegenständen,  sowie  an  geschnittenen  Muscheln,  wie  sie \r\ninTrapani  gefertigt  werden,  ferner  an  ausgesuchten  Elfen- \r\nbeinarbeiten hatte  die  Dame  ihre  besondere  Freude  und \r\nwußte  dabei  manche  heitere  Geschichte  zu  erzählen.  Der \r\nFürst  machte  uns  auf  die  ernsteren  Gegenstände  aufmerk- \r\nsam, und  so  flössen  einige  Stunden  vergnügt  und  beleh- \r\nrend vorüber. \r\n\r\nIndessen  hatte  die  Fürstin  vernommen,  daß  wir  Deutsche \r\nseien;  sie  fragte  daher  nach  Herrn  von  Riedesel,  Bartels, \r\nMunter,  welche  sie  sämtlich  gekannt  und  ihren  Charakter \r\nund  Betragen,  gar  wohl  unterscheidend,  zu  würdigen \r\nwußte.   Wir  trennten  uns  ungern  von  ihr,  und  sie  schien \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  309 \r\n\r\nuns  ungern  wegzulassen.  Dieser  Inselzustand  hat  doch \r\nimmer  etwas  Einsames,  nur  durch  vorübergehende  Teil- \r\nnahme aufgefrischt  und  erhalten. \r\n\r\nUns  führte  der  Geistliche  alsdann  in  das  Benediktiner- \r\nkloster, in  die  Zelle  eines  Bruders,  dessen,  bei  mäßigem \r\nAlter,  trauriges  und  in  sich  zurückgezogenes  Ansehn  we- \r\nnig frohe  Unterhaltung  versprach.  Er  war  jedoch  der \r\nkunstreiche  Mann,  der  die  ungeheuere  Orgel  dieser  Kirche \r\nallein  zu  bändigen  wußte.  Als  er  unsere  Wünsche  mehr \r\nerraten  als  vernommen,  erfüllte  er  sie  schweigend:  wir \r\nbegaben  uns  in  die  sehr  geräumige  Kirche,  die  er,  das \r\nherrliche  Instrument  bearbeitend,  bis  in  den  letzten  Win- \r\nkel mit  leisestem  Hauch  sowohl  als  gewaltsamsten  Tönen \r\ndurchsäuselte  und  durchschmetterte. \r\nWer  den  Mann  nicht  vorher  gesehen,  hätte  glauben  müs- \r\nsen, es  sei  ein  Riese,  der  solche  Gewalt  ausübe;  da  wir \r\naber  seine  Persönlichkeit  schon  kannten,  bewunderten \r\nwir  nur,  daß  er  in  diesem  Kampf  nicht  schon  längst  auf- \r\ngerieben sei. \r\n\r\nBald  nach  Tische  kam  der  Ahh6  mit  einem  Wagen,  da \r\ner  uns  den  entferntem  Teil  der  Stadt  zeigen  sollte.  Beim \r\nEinsteigen  ereignete  sich  ein  wundersamer  Rangstreit. \r\nIch  war  zuerst  eingestiegen  und  hätte  ihm  zur  linken \r\nHand  gesessen;  er,  einsteigend,  verlangte  ausdrücklich, \r\ndaß  ich  herumrücken  und  ihn  zu  meiner  Linken  nehmen \r\nsollte;  ich  bat  ihn,  dergleichen  Zeremonien  zu  unterlassen. \r\nVerzeiht,  sagte  er,  daß  wir  also  sitzen!  denn  wenn  ich \r\nmeinen  Platz  zu  Eurer  Rechten  nehme,  so  glaubt  jeder- \r\nmann, daß  ich  mit  Euch  fahre;  sitze  ich  aber  zur  Linken, \r\nso  ist  es  ausgesprochen,  daß  Ihr  mit  mir  fahrt,  mit  mir \r\nnämlich,  der  ich  Euch  im  Namen  des  Fürsten  die  Stadt \r\nzeige.  Dagegen  war  freilich  nichts  einzuwenden,  und  also \r\ngeschah  es. \r\n\r\nWir  fuhren  die  Straßen  hinaufwärts,  wo  die  Lava,  welche \r\n1669  einen  großen  Teil  dieser  Stadt  zerstörte,  noch  bis \r\nauf  unsere  Tage  sichtbar  blieb.  Der  starre  Feuerstrom \r\nward  bearbeitet  wie  ein  anderer  Fels,  selbst  auf  ihm \r\nwaren  Straßen  vorgezeichnet  und  teilweise  gebaut.   Ich \r\n\r\n\r\n3 1  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nschlug  ein  unbezweifeltes  Stück  des  Geschmolzenen  her- \r\nunter, bedenkend,  daß  vor  meiner  Abreise  aus  Deutsch- \r\nland schon  der  Streit  über  die  Vulkanität  der  Basalte  sich \r\nentzündet  hatte.  Und  so  tat  ichs  an  mehreren  Stellen, \r\num  zu  mancherlei  Abänderungen  zu  gelangen. \r\nWären  jedoch  Einheimische  nicht  selbst  Freunde  ihrer \r\nGegend,  nicht  selbst  bemüht,  entweder  eines  Vorteils  oder \r\nder  Wissenschaft  willen,  das,  was  in  ihrem  Revier  merk- \r\nwürdig ist,  zusammenzustellen,  so  müßte  der  Reisende \r\nsich  lang  vergebens  quälen.  Schon  in  Neapel  hatte  mich \r\nder  Lavenhändler  sehr  gefördert,  hier,  in  einem  weit \r\nhöheren  Sinne,  der  Ritter  Gioeni.  Ich  fand  in  seiner \r\nreichen,  sehr  galant  aufgestellten  Sammlung  die  Laven \r\ndes  Ätna,  die  Basalte  am  Fuß  desselben,  verändertes \r\nGestein,  mehr  oder  weniger  zu  erkennen;  alles  wurde \r\nfreundlichst  vorgezeigt.  Am  meisten  hatte  ich  Zeolithe \r\nzu  bewundern,  aus  den  schroffen,  im  Meere  stehenden \r\nFelsen  unter  Jaci. \r\n\r\nAls  wir  den  Ritter  um  die  Mittel  befragten,  wie  man  sich \r\nbenehmen  müsse,  um  den  Ätna  zu  besteigen,  wollte  er \r\nvon  einer  Wagnis  nach  dem  Gipfel,  besonders  in  der  ge- \r\ngenwärtigen Jahreszeit,  gar  nichts  hören.  Überhaupt,  sagte \r\ner,  nachdem  er  uns  um  Verzeihung  gebeten,  die  hier  an- \r\nkommenden Fremden  sehen  die  Sache  für  allzuleicht  an; \r\nwir  andern  Nachbarn  des  Berges  sind  schon  zufrieden, \r\nwenn  wir  ein  ])aarmal  in  unserm  Leben  die  beste  Gele- \r\ngenheit abgepaßt  und  den  (iipfel  erreicht  haben.  Brydone, \r\nder  zuerst  durch  seine  Beschreibung  die  Lust  nach  diesem \r\nFeuergipfel  entzündet,  ist  gar  nicht  hinaufgekommen; \r\nGraf  Borch  läßt  den  Leser  in  Ungewißheit,  aber  auch  er \r\nist  nur  bis  auf  eine  gewisse  Höhe  gelangt;  und  so  könnte \r\nich  von  mehrern  sagen.  Für  jetzt  erstreckt  sich  der  Schnee \r\nnoch  allzuweit  herunter  und  breitet  unüberwindliche  Hin- \r\ndernisse entgegen.  Wenn  Sie  meinem  Rate  folgen  mögen, \r\nso  reiten  Sie  morgen,  bei  guter  Zeit,  bis  an  den  Fuß  des \r\nMonte  Rosso.  Besteigen  Sie  diese  Höhe!  Sie  werden \r\nvon  da  des  herrlichsten  Anblicks  genießen  und  zugleich \r\ndie  alte  Lava  bemerken,  welche,  dort  1669  ents|irungen, \r\nunglücklicherweise  sich  nach  der  Stadt  hereinwälzte.  Die \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  311 \r\n\r\nAussicht  ist  herrlich  und  deutlich;  man  tut  besser,  sich \r\ndas  übrige  erzählen  zu  lassen. \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  4.  Mai. \r\nFolgsam  dem  guten  Rate,  machten  wir  uns  zeitig  auf  den \r\nWeg  und  erreichten,  auf  unsern  Maultieren  immer  rück- \r\nwärts schauend,  die  Region  der  durch  die  Zeit  noch  un- \r\ngebändigten  Laven.  Zackige  Klumpen  und  Tafeln  starrten \r\nuns  entgegen,  durch  welche  nur  ein  zufälliger  Pfad  von \r\nden  Tieren  gefunden  wurde.  Auf  der  ersten  bedeutenden \r\nHöhe  hielten  wir  still.  Kniep  zeichnete  mit  großer  Prä- \r\nzision, was  hinaufwärts  vor  uns  lag:  die  Lavenmassen  im \r\nVorgrunde,  den  Doppelgipfel  des  Monte  Rosso  links, \r\ngerade  über  uns  die  Wälder  von  Nicolosi,  aus  denen  der \r\nbeschneite,  wenig  rauchende  Gipfel  hervorstieg.  Wir \r\nrückten  dem  roten  Berge  näher,  ich  stieg  hinauf:  er  ist \r\nganz  aus  rotem  vulkanischen  Grus,  Asche  und  Steinen \r\nzusammengehäuft.  Um  die  Mündung  hätte  sich  bequem \r\nherumgehen  lassen,  hätte  nicht  ein  gewaltsam  stürmender \r\nMorgenwind  jeden  Schritt  unsicher  gemacht;  wollte  ich \r\nnur  einigermaßen  fortkommen,  so  mußte  ich  den  Mantel \r\nablegen,  nun  aber  war  der  Hut  jeden  Augenblick  in  Ge- \r\nfahr, in  den  Krater  getrieben  zu  werden,  und  ich  hinter- \r\ndrein. Deshalb  setzte  ich  mich  nieder,  um  mich  zu  fassen \r\nund  die  Gegend  zu  überschauen;  aber  auch  diese  Lage \r\nhalf  mir  nichts:  der  Sturm  kam  gerade  von  Osten  her, \r\nüber  das  herrliche  Land,  das  nah  und  fern  bis  ans  Meer \r\nunter  mir  lag.  Den  ausgedehnten  Strand  von  Messina \r\nbis  Syrakus,  mit  seinen  Krümmungen  und  Buchten,  sah \r\nich  vor  Augen,  entweder  ganz  frei  oder  durch  Felsen  des \r\nUfers  nur  wenig  bedeckt.  Als  ich  ganz  betäubt  wieder \r\nherunterkam,  hatte  Kniep  im  Schauer  seine  Zeit  gut  an- \r\ngewendet und  mit  zarten  Linien  auf  dem  Papier  gesichert, \r\nwas  der  wilde  Sturm  mich  kaum  sehen,  viel  weniger  fest- \r\nhalten ließ. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  Rachen  des  goldenen  Löwen  wieder  angelangt, \r\nfanden  wir  den  Lohnbedienten,  den  wir  nur  mit  Mühe \r\nuns  zu  begleiten  abgehalten  hatten.  Er  lobte,  daß  wir \r\nden  Gipfel  aufgegeben,  schlug  aber  für  morgen  eine  Spa- \r\n\r\n\r\n3 1 2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nzierfahrl  auf  dem  Meere,  zu  den  Felsen  von  Jaci,  an- \r\ndringlich vor:  das  sei  die  schönste  Lustpartie,  die  man \r\nvon  Catania  aus  machen  könne!  man  nehme  Trank  und \r\nSpeise  mit,  auch  wohl  Gerätschaften,  um  etwas  zu  wär- \r\nmen; seine  Frau  erbiete  sich,  dieses  Geschäft  zu  über- \r\nnehmen. Ferner  erinnerte  er  sich  des  Jubels,  wie  Eng- \r\nländer wohl  gar  einen  Kahn  mit  Musik  zur  Begleitung \r\ngenommen  hätten ,  welche  Lust  über  alle  Vorstellung  sei. \r\nDie  Felsen  von  Jaci  zogen  mich  heftig  an:  ich  hatte  gro- \r\nßes Verlangen,  mir  so  schöne  Zeolithe  herauszuschlagen, \r\nals  ich  bei  Gioeni  gesehen.  Man  konnte  ja  die  Sache  kurz \r\nfassen,  die  Begleitung  der  P>au  ablehnen.  Aber  der  war- \r\nnende Geist  des  F>ngländers  behielt  die  Oberhand;  wir \r\ntaten  auf  die  Zeolithe  Verzicht  und  dünkten  uns  nicht \r\nwenig  wegen  dieser  Enthaltsamkeit. \r\n\r\nSonnabend  den  5.  Mai. \r\nUnser  geistlicher  Begleiter  blieb  nicht  aus.  Er  führte \r\nuns,  die  Reste  alter  Baukunst  zu  sehen,  zu  welchen  der \r\nBeschauer  freilich  ein  starkes  Restaurationstalent  mit- \r\nbringen muß.  Man  zeigte  die  Reste  von  Wasserbehältern, \r\neiner  Naumachie  und  andere  dergleichen  Ruinen,  die  aber, \r\nbei  der  vielfachen  Zerstörung  der  Stadt  durch  Laven, \r\nErdbeben  und  Krieg,  dergestalt  verschüttet  und  ver- \r\nsenkt sind,  daß  Freude  und  Belehrung  nur  dem  genau- \r\nsten Kenner  altertümlicher  Baukunst  daraus  entspringen \r\nkann. \r\n\r\nEine  nochmalige  Aufwartung  beim  Prinzen  lehnte  der \r\nPater  ab,  und  wir  schieden  beiderseits  mit  lebhaften  Aus- \r\ndrücken der  Dankbarkeit  und  des  Wohlwollens. \r\n\r\nTaormina,  Sonntag  den  6.  Mai. \r\nGott  sei  Dank,  daß  alles,  was  wir  heute  gesehen,  schon \r\ngenugsam  beschrieben  ist,  mehr  aber  noch,  daß  Kniep \r\nsich  vorgenommen  hat,  morgen  den  ganzen  Tag  oben \r\nzu  zeichnen.-  Wenn  man  die  Höhe  der  Felsenwände  er- \r\nstiegen hat,  welche  ohnfern  des  Meerstrandes  in  die  Höhe \r\nsteilen,  findet  man  zwei  Gipfel  durch  ein  Halbrund  ver- \r\nbunden.  Was  dies  auch  von  Natur  für  eine  Gestalt  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  313 \r\n\r\nhabt  haben  mag,  die  Kunst  hat  nachgeholfen  und  daraus \r\nden  amphitheatralischen  Halbzirkel  für  Zuschauer  gebil- \r\ndet; Mauern  und  andere  Angebäude  von  Ziegelsteinen, \r\nsich  anschließend,  supplierten  die  nötigen  Gänge  und \r\nHallen.  Am  Fuße  des  stufenartigen  Halbzirkels  erbaute \r\nman  die  Szene  quer  vor,  verband  dadurch  die  beiden \r\nFelsen  und  vollendete  das  ungeheuerste  Natur-  und \r\nKunstwerk. \r\n\r\nSetzt  man  sich  nun  dahin,  wo  ehemals  die  obersten  Zu- \r\nschauer saßen,  so  muß  man  gestehen,  daß  wohl  nie  ein \r\nPublikum  im  Theater  solche  Gegenstände  vor  sich  ge- \r\nhabt. Rechts  zur  Seite,  auf  höheren  Felsen,  erheben  sich \r\nKastelle,  weiter  unten  liegt  die  Stadt,  und  obschon  diese \r\nBaulichkeiten  aus  neueren  Zeiten  sind,  so  standen  doch \r\nvor  alters  wohl  eben  dergleichen  auf  derselben  Stelle. \r\nNun  sieht  man  an  dem  ganzen  langen  Gebirgsrücken \r\ndes  Ätna  hin,  links  das  Meerufer  bis  nach  Catania,  ja \r\nSyrakus;  dann  schließt  der  ungeheure  dampfende  Feuer- \r\nberg das  weite,  breite  Bild,  aber  nicht  schrecklich;  denn \r\ndie  mildernde  Atmosphäre  zeigt  ihn  entfernter  und  sanf- \r\nter, als  er  ist. \r\n\r\nWendet  man  sich  von  diesem  Anblick  in  die  an  der  Rück- \r\nseite der  Zuschauer  angebrachten  Gänge,  so  hat  man  die \r\nsämtlichen  Felswände  links,  zwischen  denen  und  dem \r\nMeere  sich  der  Weg  nach  Messina  hinschlingt.  Fels- \r\ngruppen und  Felsrücken  im  Meere  selbst,  die  Küste  von \r\nKalabrien  in  der  weitesten  Ferne,  nur  mit  Aufmerk- \r\nsamkeit von  gelind  sich  erhebenden  Wolken  zu  unter- \r\nscheiden. \r\n\r\nWir  stiegen  gegen  das  Theater  hinab,  verweilten  in  des- \r\nsen Ruinen,  an  welchen  ein  geschickter  Architekt  seine \r\nRestaurationsgabe  wenigstens  auf  dem  Papier  versuchen \r\nsollte,  unternahmen  sodann,  uns  durch  die  Gärten  eine \r\nBahn  nach  der  Stadt  zu  brechen.  Allein  hier  erfuhren \r\nwir,  was  ein  Zaun  von  nebeneinander  gepflanzten  Aga- \r\nven für  ein  undurchdringliches  Bollwerk  sei:  durch  die \r\nverschränkten  Blätter  sieht  man  durch  und  glaubt  auch \r\nhindurch  dringen  zu  können,  allein  die  kräftigen  Stacheln \r\nder  Blattränder  sind  empfindliche  Hindernisse;  tritt  man \r\n\r\n\r\n3 1 4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nauf  ein  solches  kolossales  Blatt,  in  Hoftnung,  es  werde \r\nuns  tragen,  so  bricht  es  zusammen,  und  anstatt  hinüber \r\nins  Freie  zu  kommen,  fallen  wir  einer  NachbarpHanze  in \r\ndie  Arme.  Zuletzt  entwickelten  wir  uns  doch  diesem \r\nLabyrinthe,  genossen  weniges  in  der  Stadt,  konnten  aber \r\nvor  Sonnenuntergang  von  der  Gegend  nicht  scheiden. \r\nUnendlich  schön  war  es,  zu  beobachten,  wie  diese  in \r\nallen  Punkten  bedeutende  Gegend  nach  und  nach  in  Fin- \r\nsternis versank. \r\n\r\nUnter  Taormina,  am  Meer,  Montag  de?i  y.  Mai. \r\nKniepen,  mir  vom  Glück  zugeführt,  kann  ich  nicht  genug \r\npreisen,  da  er  mich  einer  Bürde  entledigt,  die  mir  un- \r\nerträglich wäre,  und  mich  meiner  eigenen  Natur  wieder- \r\ngibt. Er  ist  hinaufgegangen,  im  einzelnen  zu  zeichnen, \r\nwas  wir  obenhin  betrachtet.  Er  wird  seine  Bleistifte \r\nmanchmal  spitzen,  und  ich  sehe  nicht,  wie  er  fertig  wer- \r\nden will.  Das  hätte  ich  nun  auch  alles  wiedersehen  kön- \r\nnen! Erst  wollte  ich  mit  hinaufgehen,  dann  aber  reizte \r\nmichs,  hier  zu  bleiben;  die  Enge  sucht  ich  wie  der  Vogel, \r\nder  sein  Nest  bauen  möchte.  In  einem  schlechten,  ver- \r\nwahrlosten Bauergarten  habe  ich  mich  auf  ürangenäste \r\ngesetzt  und  mich  in  Grillen  vertieft.  Orangenäste,  wor- \r\nauf der  Reisende  sitzt,  klingt  etwas  wunderbar,  wird \r\naber  ganz  natürlich,  wenn  man  weiß,  daß  der  Orangen- \r\nbaum, seiner  Natur  überlassen,  sich  bald  über  der  Wurzel \r\nin  Zweige  trennt,  die  mit  der  Zeit  zu  entschiedenen  .Asten \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  saß  ich,  den  Blan  zu  Ährusikaa  weiter  denkend, \r\neine  dramatische  Konzentration  der  Odyssee.  Ich  halte \r\nsie  nicht  für  unmöglich,  nur  müßte  man  den  Grundunter- \r\nschied des  Drama  und  der  ]\"'.popöe  recht  ins. \\uge  fassen. \r\nKniep  ist  herabgekommen  und  hat  zwei  ungeheure  Blätter, \r\nreinlichst  gezeichnet,  zufrieden  und  vergnügt  zurückge- \r\nbracht. Beide  wird  er  zum  ewigen  Gedächtnis  an  diesen \r\nherrlichen  Tag  für  mich  ausführen. \r\n\r\nZu  vergessen  ist  nicht,  daß  wir  auf  dieses  schöne  Ufer \r\nunter  dem  reinsten  Himmel  von  einem  kleinen  Altan  her- \r\nabschauten, Rosen  erblickten  und  Nachtigallen  hörten. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  315 \r\n\r\nDiese  singen  hier,  wie  man  uns  versichert,  sechs  ^Monate \r\nhindurch. \r\n\r\nAus  der  Erinnerung. \r\nWar  ich  nun  durch  die  Gegenwart  und  Tätigkeit  eines \r\ngeschickten  Künstlers  und  durch  eigne,  obgleich  nur  ein- \r\nzelne und  schwächere  Bemühungen  gewiß,  daß  mir  von \r\nden  interessantesten  Gegenden  und  ihren  Teilen  feste \r\nwohlgewählte  Bilder,  im  Umriß  und  nach  Belieben  auch \r\nausgeführt,  bleiben  würden,  so  gab  ich  um  so  mehr  einem \r\nnach  und  nach  auflebenden  Drange  nach,  die  gegen- \r\nwärtige herrliche  Umgebung,  das  Meer,  die  Inseln,  die \r\nHäfen,  durch  poetische  würdige  Gestalten  zu  beleben  und \r\nmir  auf  und  aus  diesem  Lokal  eine  Komposition  zu  bil- \r\nden, in  einem  Sinne  und  in  einem  Ton,  wie  ich  sie  noch \r\nnicht  hervorgebracht.  Die  Klarheit  des  Himmels,  der \r\nHauch  des  Meeres,  die  Düfte,  wodurch  die  Gebirge  mit \r\nHimmel  und  Meer  gleichsam  in  ein  Element  aufgelöst \r\nwurden:  alles  dies  gab  Nahrung  meinen  Vorsätzen,  und \r\nindem  ich  in  jenem  schönen  öffentlichen  Garten  zwischen \r\nblühenden  Hecken  von  Oleander,  durch  Lauben  von \r\nfruchttragenden  Orangen-  und  Zitronenbäumen  wandelte \r\nund  zwischen  andern  Bäumen  und  Sträuchen,  die  mir \r\nunbekannt  waren,  verweilte,  fühlte  ich  den  fremden  Ein- \r\nfluß auf  das  allerangenehmste. \r\n\r\nIch  hatte  mir,  überzeugt,  daß  es  für  mich  keinen  bessern \r\nKommentar  zur  Odyssee  geben  könne,  als  eben  gerade \r\ndiese  lebendige  Umgebung,  ein  Exemplar  verschafft  und \r\nlas  es  nach  meiner  Art  mit  unglaublichem  Anteil.  Doch \r\nwurde  ich  gar  bald  zu  eigner  Produktion  angeregt,  die, \r\nso  seltsam  sie  auch  im  ersten  Augenblicke  schien,  mir \r\ndoch  immer  lieber  ward  und  mich  endlich  ganz  beschäf- \r\ntigte. Ich  ergriff  nämlich  den  Gedanken,  den  Gegenstand \r\nder  Nausikaa  als  Tragödie  zu  behandeln. \r\nEs  ist  mir  selbst  nicht  möglich,  abzusehen,  was  ich  daraus \r\nwürde  gemacht  haben,  aber  ich  war  über  den  Plan  bald \r\nmit  mir  einig.  Der  Hauptsinn  war  der,  in  der  Nausikaa \r\neine  treffliche,  von  vielen  umworbene  Jungfrau  darzu- \r\nstellen, die,  sich  keiner  Neigung  bewußt,  alle  Freier  bis- \r\n\r\n\r\n3 1 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nher  ablehnend  behandelt,  durch  einen  seltsamen  Fremd- \r\nling aber  gerührt,  aus  ihrem  Zustand  heraustritt  und  durch \r\neine  voreilige  Äußerung  ihrer  Neigung  sich  kompromit- \r\ntiert, was  die  Situation  vollkommen  tragisch  macht.  Diese \r\neinfache  Fabel  sollte  durch  den  Reichtum  der  subordi- \r\nnierten Motive  und  besonders  durch  das  Meer-  und  Insel- \r\nhafte der  eigentlichen  Ausführung  und  des  besondern  Tons \r\nerfreulich  werden. \r\n\r\nDer  erste  Akt  begann  mit  dem  Ballspiel.  Die  unerwartete \r\nBekanntschaft  wird  gemacht,  und  die  Bedenklichkeit,  den \r\nFremden  nicht  selbst  in  die  Stadt  zu  führen,  wird  schon \r\nein  Vorbote  der  Neigung. \r\n\r\nDer  zweite  Akt  exponierte  das  Haus  des  Alkinous,  die \r\nCharaktere  der  Freier  und  endigte  mit  dem  Eintritt  des \r\nUlysses. \r\n\r\nDer  dritte  war  ganz  der  Bedeutsamkeit  des  Abenteurers \r\ngewidmet,  und  ich  hoffte,  in  der  dialogierten  Erzählung \r\nseiner  Abenteuer,  die  von  den  verschiedenen  Zuhörern \r\nsehr  verschieden  aufgenommen  werden,  etwas  Künstliches \r\nund  Erfreuliches  zu  leisten.  Während  der  Erzählung  er- \r\nhöhen sich  die  Leidenschaften,  und  der  lebhafte  Anteil \r\nNausikaas  an  dem  Fremdling  wird  durch  Wirkung  und \r\nGegenwirkung  endlich  her  vorgeschlagen. \r\nIm  vierten  Akte  betätigt  Ulysses  außer  der  Szene  seine \r\nTapferkeit,  indessen  die  Frauen  zurückbleiben  und  der \r\nNeigung,  der  Hoffnung  und  allen  zarten  Gefühlen  Raum \r\nlassen.  Bei  den  großen  Vorteilen,  welche  der  Fremdling \r\ndavonträgt,  hält  sich  Nausikaa  noch  weniger  zusammen \r\nund  kompromittiert  sich  unwiderruflich  mit  ihren  Lands- \r\nleuten. Ulyß,  der  halb  schuldig,  halb  unschuldig  dieses \r\nalles  veranlaßt,  muß  sich  zuletzt  als  einen  Scheidenden \r\nerklären,  und  es  bleibt  dem  guten  Mädchen  nichts  übrig, \r\nals  im  fünften  Akte  den  'l'od  zu  suchen. \r\nEs  war  in  dieser  Komposition  nichts,  was  ich  nicht  aus \r\neignen  Erfahrungen  nach  der  Natur  hätte  ausmalen  können. \r\nSelbst  auf  der  Reise,  selbst  in  Gefahr,  Neigungen  zu  er- \r\nregen, die,  wenn  sie  auch  kein  tragisches  Ende  nehmen, \r\ndoch  schmerzlich  genug,  gefährlich  und  .schädlich  werden \r\n)<önnen;  selbst  in  dem  Falle,  in  einer  so  großen  Entfernung \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  317 \r\n\r\nvon  der  Heimat  abgelegne  Gegenstände,  Reiseabenteuer, \r\nLebensvorfälle  zu  Unterhaltung  der  Gesellschaft  mit  leb- \r\nhaften Farben  auszumalen,  von  der  Jugend  für  einen  Halb- \r\ngott, von  gesetztem  Personen  für  einen  Aufschneider  ge- \r\nhalten zu  werden,  manche  unverdiente  Gunst,  manches \r\nunerwartete  Hindernis  zu  erfahren:  das  alles  gab  mir  ein \r\nsolches  Attachement  an  diesen  Plan,  an  diesen  Vorsatz, \r\ndaß  ich  darüber  meinen  Aufenthalt  zu  Palermo,  ja  den \r\ngrößten  Teil  meiner  übrigen  sizilianischen  Reise  ver- \r\nträumte. Weshalb  ich  denn  auch  von  allen  Unbequem- \r\nlichkeiten wenig  empfand,  da  ich  mich  auf  dem  über- \r\nklassischen Boden  in  einer  poetischen  Stimmung  fühlte, \r\nin  der  ich  das,  was  ich  erfuhr,  was  ich  sah,  was  ich  be- \r\nmerkte, was  mir  entgegenkam,  alles  auffassen  und  in \r\neinem  erfreulichen  Gefäß  bewahren  konnte. \r\nNach  meiner  löblichen  oder  unlöblichen  Gewohnheit \r\nschrieb  ich  wenig  oder  nichts  davon  auf,  arbeitete  aber \r\nden  größten  Teil  bis  aufs  letzte  Detail  im  Geiste  durch, \r\nwo  es  denn,  durch  nachfolgende  Zerstreuungen  zurück- \r\ngedrängt, liegen  geblieben,  bis  ich  gegenwärtig  nur  eine \r\nflüchtige  Erinnerung  davon  zurückrufe. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Wege  nach  Messina. \r\n\r\nMan  hat  hohe  Kalkfelsen  links.  Sie  werden  farbiger  und \r\nmachen  schöne  Meerbusen;  dann  folgt  eine  Art  Gestein, \r\ndas  man  Tonschiefer  oder  Grauwacke  nennen  möchte. \r\nIn  den  Bächen  finden  sich  schon  Granitgeschiebe.  Die \r\ngelben  Äpfel  des  Solanum,  die  roten  Blüten  des  Oleanders \r\nmachen  die  Landschaft  lustig.  Der  Fiume  Nisi  bringt \r\nGlimmerschiefer,  so  wie  auch  die  folgenden  Bäche. \r\n\r\nVom  Ostwinde  bestürmt,  ritten  wir  zwischen  dem  rechter \r\nHand  wogenden  Meere  und  den  Felswänden  hin,  an  denen \r\nwir  vorgestern  oben  herabgesehen  hatten,  diesen  Tag  be- \r\nständig mit  dem  Wasser  im  Kampfe;  wir  kamen  über \r\nunzählige  Bäche,  unter  welchen  ein  größerer,  Nisi,  den \r\nEhrentitel  eines  Flusses  führt;  doch  diese  Gewässer,  so \r\nwie  das  Gerolle,  das  sie  mitbringen,  waren  leichter  zu \r\nüberwinden  als  das  Meer,  das  heftig  stürmte  und  an  vielen \r\n\r\n\r\n3i8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nStellen  über  den  Weg  hinweg  bis  an  die  Felsen  schlug \r\nund  zurück  auf  die  Wanderer  spritzte.  Herrlich  war  das \r\nanzusehen,  und  die  seltsame  Begebenheit  ließ  uns  das \r\nUnbequeme  übertragen. \r\n\r\nZugleich  sollte  es  nicht  an  mineralogischer  Betrachtung \r\nfehlen.  Die  ungeheuren  Kalkfelsen,  verwitternd,  stürzen \r\nherunter,  deren  weiche  Teile,  durch  die  Bewegung  der \r\nWellen  aufgerieben,  die  zugemischten  festeren  übrig  lassen, \r\nund  so  ist  der  ganze  Strand  mit  bunten,  homsteinartigen \r\nFeuersteinen  überdeckt,  wovon  mehrere  Muster  aufge- \r\npackt worden. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  gelangten  wir  nach  Messina,  bequemten  uns,  weil \r\nwir  keine  Gelegenheit  kannten,  die  erste  Nacht  in  dem \r\nQuartier  des  Vetturins  zuzubringen,  um  uns  den  andern \r\nMorgen  nach  einem  bessern  Wohnort  umzusehen.  Dieser \r\nEntschluß  gab  gleich  beim  Eintritt  den  fürchterlichsten \r\nBegriff  einer  zerstörten  Stadt:  denn  wir  ritten  eine  Viertel- \r\nstunde lang  an  Trümmern  nach  Trümmern  vorbei,  ehe \r\nwir  zur  Herberge  kamen,  die,  in  diesem  ganzen  Revier \r\nallein  wieder  aufgebaut,  aus  den  Fenstern  des  obern \r\nStocks  nur  eine  zackige  Ruinenwüste  übersehen  ließ. \r\nAußer  dem  Bezirk  dieses  Gehöftes  spürte  man  weder \r\nMensch  noch  Tier;  es  war  nachts  eine  furchtbare  Stille. \r\nDie  Türen  ließen  sich  weder  verschließen  noch  verriegeln; \r\nauf  menschliche  Gäste  war  man  hier  so  wenig  eingerichtet \r\nals  in  ähnlichen  l'ferdewohnungen;  und  doch  schliefen \r\nwir  ruhig  auf  einer  Matratze,  welche  der  dienstfertige  Vet- \r\nturin  dem  Wirte  unter  dem  Leibe  weggeschwatzt  hatte. \r\n\r\nMessina ^  Mittwoch  den  g.  Mai. \r\nHeute  trennten  wir  uns  von  dem  wackern  Führer,  ein \r\ngutes  Trinkgeld  belohnte  seine  sorgfältigen  Dienste.  Wir \r\nschieden  freundlich,  nachdem  er  uns  vorher  noch  einen \r\nLohnbedienten  verschafft,  der  uns  gleich  in  die  beste \r\nHerberge  bringen  und  alles  Merkwürdige  von  Messina \r\nvorzeigen  sollte.  Der  Wirt,  um  seinen  Wunsch,  uns  los- \r\nzuwerden, schleunigst  erfüllt  zu  sehen,  half  Koffer  und \r\nsämtliches  Gepäck  auf  das  schnellste  in  eine  angenehme \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  319 \r\n\r\nWohnung  schaffen,  näher  dem  belebten  Teile  der  Stadt, \r\ndas  heißt  außerhalb  der  Stadt  selbst.  Damit  aber  verhält \r\nes  sich  folgendermaßen.  Nach  dem  Ungeheuern  Unglück, \r\ndas  Messina  betraf,  blieb,  nach  zwölftausend  umgekom- \r\nmenen Einwohnern,  für  die  übrigen  dreißigtausend  keine \r\nWohnung:  die  meisten  Gebäude  waren  niedergestürzt,  die \r\nzerrissenen  Mauern  der  übrigen  gaben  einen  unsichern \r\nAufenthalt.  Man  errichtete  daher  eiligst  im  Norden  von \r\nMessina,  auf  einer  großen  Wiese,  eine  Bretterstadt,  von \r\nder  sich  am  schnellsten  derjenige  einen  Begriff  macht, \r\nder  zu  Meßzeiten  den  Römerberg  zu  Frankfurt,  den  Markt \r\nzu  Leipzig  durchwanderte;  denn  alle  Kramläden  und \r\nWerkstätte  sind  gegen  die  Straße  geöffnet,  vieles  ereignet \r\nsich  außerhalb.  Daher  sind  nur  wenig  größere  Gebäude \r\nauch  nicht  sonderlich  gegen  das  Öffentliche  verschlossen, \r\nindem  die  Bewohner  manche  Zeit  unter  freiem  Himmel \r\nzubringen.  So  wohnen  sie  nun  schon  drei  Jahre,  und \r\ndiese  Buden-,  Hütten-,  ja  Zeltwirtschaft  hat  auf  den \r\nCharakter  der  Einwohner  entschiedenen  Einfluß.  Das \r\nEntsetzen  über  jenes  ungeheure  Ereignis,  die  Furcht  vor \r\neinem  ähnlichen  treibt  sie,  der  Freuden  des  Augenblicks \r\nmit  gutmütigem  Frohsinn  zu  genießen.  Die  Sorge  vor \r\nneuem  Unheil  ward  am  21.  April,  also  ohngefähr  vor \r\nzwanzig  Tagen,  erneuert:  ein  merklicher  Erdstoß  erschüt- \r\nterte den  Boden  abermals.  Man  zeigte  uns  eine  kleine \r\nKirche,  wo  eine  Masse  Menschen,  gerade  in  dem  Augen- \r\nblick zusammengedrängt,  diese  Erschütterung  empfanden. \r\nEinige  Personen,  die  darin  gewesen,  schienen  sich  von \r\nihrem  Schrecken  noch  nicht  erholt  zu  haben.  . \r\nBeim  Aufsuchen  und  Betrachten  dieser  Gegenstände  leitete \r\nuns  ein  freundlicher  Konsul,  der,  unaufgefordert,  vielfache \r\nSorge  für  uns  trug — in  dieser  Trümmerwüste  mehr  als \r\nirgendwo  dankbar  anzuerkennen.  Zugleich  auch,  da  er \r\nvernahm,  daß  wir  bald  abzureisen  wünschten,  machte  er \r\nuns  einem  französischen  Kauffahrer  bekannt,  der  im  Be- \r\ngriff stehe,  nach  Neapel  zu  segeln — doppelt  erwünscht, \r\nxla  die  weiße  Flagge  vor  den  Seeräubern  sichert. \r\nEben  hatten  wir  unserm  gütigen  Führer  den  Wunsch  zu \r\nerkennen  gegeben,  eine  der  größern,  obgleich  auch  nur \r\n\r\n\r\n320  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\neinstöckigen  Hütten  inwendig,  ihre  Einrichtung  und  ex- \r\ntemporierte Haushaltung  zu  sehen,  als  ein  freundlicher \r\nMann  sich  an  uns  anschloß,  der  sich  bald  als  französischer \r\nSprachmeister  bezeichnete,  welchem  der  Konsul,  nach \r\nvollbrachtem  Spaziergange,  unsern  Wunsch,  solch  ein \r\nGebäude  zu  sehen,  eröffnete  mit  dem  Ersuchen,  uns \r\nbei  sich  einzuführen  und  mit  den  Seinigen  bekannt  zu \r\nmachen. \r\n\r\nWir  traten  in  die  mit  Brettern  beschlagene  und  gedei  kte \r\nHütte.  Der  Eindruck  war  völlig  wie  der  jener  Meßbuden, \r\nwo  man  wilde  Tiere  oder  sonstige  Abenteuer  für  Geld \r\nsehen  läßt:  das  Zimmerwerk  an  den  Wänden  wie  am \r\nDache  sichtbar;  ein  grüner  Vorhang  sonderte  den  vordem \r\nRaum,  der,  nicht  gedielt,  tennenartig  geschlagen  schien. \r\nStühle  und  Tische  befanden  sich  da,  nichts  weiter  von \r\nHausgeräte.  Erleuchtet  war  der  Platz  von  oben  durch \r\nzufällige  (Öffnungen  der  Bretter.  Wir  diskurierten  eine \r\nZeitlang,  und  ich  betrachtete  mir  die  grüne  Hülle  und  das \r\ndarüber  sichtbare  innere  Dachgebälke,  als  auf  einmal, \r\nhüben  und  drüben  des  Vorhangs,  ein  paar  allerliebste \r\nMädchenköpfchen  neugierig  herausguckten,  schwarzäugig, \r\nschwarzlockig,  die  aber,  sobald  sie  sich  bemerkt  sahen, \r\nwie  der  Blitz  verschwanden,  auf  Ansuchen  des  Konsuls \r\njedoch,  nach  so  viel  verflossener  Zeit,  als  nötig  war,  sich \r\nanzuziehen,  auf  wohlgeputzten  und  niedlichen  Körperchen \r\nwieder  hervortraten  und  sich  mit  ihren  bunten  Kleidern \r\ngar  zierlich  vor  dem  grünen  Teppich  ausnahmen.  Aus \r\nihren  Fragen  konnten  wir  wohl  merken,  daß  sie  uns  für \r\nfabelhafte  Wesen  aus  einer  andern  Welt  hielten,  in  wel- \r\nchem liebenswürdigen  Irrtum  sie  unsere  Antworten  nur \r\nmehr  bestärken  mußten.  Auf  eine  heitere  Weise  malte \r\nder  Konsul  unsere  märchenhafte  Erscheinung  aus;  die \r\nUnterhaltung  war  sehr  angenehm,  schwer,  sich  zu  trennen. \r\nVor  der  Tür  erst  fiel  uns  auf,  daß  wir  die  innern  Räume \r\nnicht  gesehen  und  die  Hau.skonstruktion  über  die  Be- \r\nwohnerinnen vergessen  halten. \r\n\r\nDer  Konsul,  unter  andern,  sagte,  daß  es,  wo  nicht  un- \r\numgänglich nötig,  doch  wohlgetan  sei,  dem  Gouverneur \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  321 \r\n\r\naufzuwarten,  der,  ein  wunderlicher  alter  Mann,  nach  Laune \r\nund  Vorurteil  ebensogut  schaden  als  nutzen  könne:  dem \r\nKonsul  werde  es  zugunsten  gerechnet,  wenn  er  bedeutende \r\nFremde  vorstelle;  auch  wisse  der  Ankömmling  nie,  ob  er \r\ndieses  Mannes  auf  eine  oder  andere  Weise  bedürfe.  Dem \r\nFreunde  zu  Gefallen  ging  ich  mit. \r\n\r\nIns  Vorzimmer  tretend,  hörten  wir  drinne  ganz  entsetz- \r\nlichen Lärm;  ein  Laufer  mit  Pulcinell-Gebärden  raunte \r\ndem  Konsul  ins  Ohr:  Böser  Tag!  gefährliche  Stunde! \r\nDoch  traten  wir  hinein  und  fanden  den  uralten  Gouver- \r\nneur, uns  den  Rücken  zugewandt,  zunächst  des  Fensters \r\nan  einem  Tische  sitzen.  Große  Haufen  vergilbter  alter \r\nBriefschaften  lagen  vor  ihm,  von  denen  er  die  unbe- \r\nschriebenen Blätter  mit  größter  Gelassenheit  abschnitt \r\nund  seinen  haushältischen  Charakter  dadurch  zu  erkennen \r\ngab.  Während  dieser  friedlichen  Beschäftigung  schalt  und \r\nfluchte  er  fürchterlich  auf  einen  anständigen  Mann  los, \r\nder  seiner  Kleidung  nach  mit  Malta  verwandt  sein  konnte \r\nund  sich  mit  vieler  Gemütsruhe  und  Präzision  verteidigte, \r\nwozu  ihm  jedoch  wenig  Raum  blieb.  Der  Gescholtene \r\nund  Angeschriene  suchte  mit  Fassung  einen  Verdacht  ab- \r\nzulehnen, den  der  Gouverneur — so  schien  es — auf  ihn, \r\nals  einen  ohne  Befugnis  mehrmals  An-  und  Abreisenden, \r\nmochte  geworfen  haben;  der  Mann  berief  sich  auf  seine \r\nPässe  und  bekannte  Verhältnisse  in  Neapel.  Dies  aber \r\nhalf  alles  nichts;  der  Gouverneur  zerschnitt  seine  alten \r\nBriefschaften,  sonderte  das  weiße  Papier  sorgfältig  und \r\ntobte  fortwährend. \r\n\r\nAußer  uns  beiden  standen  noch  etwa  zwölf  Personen  in \r\neinem  weiten  Kreise,  dieses  Tiergefechtes  Zeugen,  uns \r\nwahrscheinlich  den  Platz  an  der  Türe  beneidend,  als  gute \r\nGelegenheit,  wenn  der  Erzürnte  allenfalls  den  Krücken- \r\nstock erheben  und  dreinschlagen  sollte.  Die  Gesichts- \r\nzüge des  Konsuls  hatten  sich  bei  dieser  Szene  merklich \r\nverlängert;  mich  tröstete  des  Laufers  possenhafte  Nähe, \r\nder,  draußen  vor  der  Schwelle,  hinter  mir  allerlei  Faxen \r\nschnitt,  mich,  wenn  ich  manchmal  umblickte,  zu  beruhi- \r\ngen, als  habe  das  so  viel  nicht  zu  bedeuten. \r\nAuch  entwirrte  sich  der  gräßliche  Handel  noch  ganz  ge- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  21 \r\n\r\n\r\n32  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nlinde:  der  Gouverneur  schloß  damit,  es  halte  ilm  zwar \r\nnichts  ab,  den  Betretenen  einzustecken  und  in  Verwah- \r\nrung zappeln  zu  lassen,  allein  es  möge  diesmal  hingehen; \r\ner  solle  die  paar  bestimmten  Tage  in  Messina  bleiben, \r\nalsdann  aber  sich  fortpacken  und  niemals  wiederkehren. \r\nGanz  ruhig,  ohne  die  Miene  zu  verändern,  beurlaubte \r\nsich  der  Mann,  grüßte  anständig  die  Versammlung  und \r\nuns  besonders,  die  er  durchschneiden  mußte,  um  zur \r\nTüre  zu  gelangen.  Als  der  Gouverneur,  ihm  noch  etwas \r\nnachzuschelten,  sich  ingrimmig  umkehrte,  erblickte  er \r\nuns,  faßte  sich  sogleich,  winkte  dem  Konsul,  und  wir \r\ntraten  an  ihn  heran. \r\n\r\nEin  Mann  von  sehr  hohem  Alter,  gebückten  Hauptes, \r\nunter  grauen  struppigen  Augenbrauen  schwarze  tief- \r\nliegende Blicke  hervorsendend;  nun  ein  ganz  anderer  als \r\nkurz  zuvor.  Er  hieß  mich  zu  sich  sitzen,  fragte,  in  sei- \r\nnem Geschäft  ununterbrochen  fortfahrend,  nach  mancher- \r\nlei, worüber  ich  ihm  Bescheid  gab;  zuletzt  fügte  er  hinzu, \r\nich  sei,  solange  ich  hier  bliebe,  zu  seiner  Tafel  geladen. \r\nDer  Konsul,  zufrieden  wie  ich,  ja  noch  zufriedener,  weil \r\ner  die  Gefahr,  der  wir  entronnen,  besser  kannte,  flog  die \r\nTreppe  hinunter,  und  mir  war  alle  Lust  vergangen,  die- \r\nser Löwenhöhle  je  wieder  nah  zu  treten. \r\n\r\nDonnerstag  den  lo.  Mai. \r\nZwar  bei  hellstem  Sonnenschein  in  einer  angenehmem \r\nWohnung  erwachend,  fanden  wir  uns  doch  immer  in  dem \r\nunseligen  Messina.  Einzig  unangenehm  ist  der  Anblick \r\nder  sogenannten  Palazzata,  einer  sichelförmigen  Reihe \r\nvon  wahrhaften  Palästen,  die,  wohl  in  der  Länge  einer \r\nViertelstunde,  die  Reede  einschließen  und  bezeichnen. \r\nAlles  waren  steinerne,  vierstockige  Gebäude,  von  wel- \r\nchen mehrere  Vorderseiten  bis  aufs  Hauptgesims  noch \r\nvöllig  stehen,  andere  bis  auf  den  dritten,  zweiten,  ersten \r\nStock  heruntergebrochen  sind,  so  daß  diese  ehemalige \r\nl'rachtreihe  nun  aufs  widerlichste  zahnlückig  erscheint \r\nund  auch  durchlöchert;  denn  der  blaue  Himmel  schaut \r\nbeinahe  durch  alle  Fenster.  Die  inneren  eigentlichen \r\n^\\'ohnungen  sind  sämtlich  zusammengestürzt. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  17  87  323 \r\n\r\nAn  diesem  seltsamen  Phänomen  ist  Ursache,  daß,  nach \r\nder  von  Reichen  begonnenen  architektonischen  Pracht- \r\nanlage, weniger  begüterte  Nachbarn,  mit  dem  Scheine \r\nwetteifernd,  ihre  alten,  aus  größern  und  kleinern  Fluß- \r\ngeschieben und  vielem  Kalk  zusammengekneteten  Häuser \r\nhinter  neuen,  aus  Quaderstücken  aufgeführten  Vorder- \r\nseiten versteckten.  Jenes  an  sich  schon  unsichere  Gefüge \r\nmußte,  von  der  Ungeheuern  Erschütterung  aufgelöst  und \r\nzerbröckelt,  zusammenstürzen;  wie  man  denn  unter  man- \r\nchen bei  so  großem  Unglück  vorgekommenen  wunder- \r\nbaren Rettungen  auch  folgendes  erzählt:  der  Bewohner \r\neines  solchen  Gebäudes  sei  im  furchtbaren  Augenblick \r\ngerade  in  die  Mauervertiefung  eines  Fensters  getreten, \r\ndas  Haus  aber  hinter  ihm  völlig  zusammengestürzt;  und \r\nso  habe  er,  in  der  Höhe  gerettet,  den  Augenblick  seiner \r\nBefreiung  aus  diesem  luftigen  Kerker  beruhigt  abge- \r\nwartet. Daß  jene  aus  Mangel  naher  Bruchsteine  so \r\nschlechte  Bauart  hauptsächlich  schuld  an  dem  völligen \r\nRuin  der  Stadt  gewesen,  zeigt  die  Beharrlichkeit  solider \r\nGebäude.  Der  Jesuiten  Kollegium  und  Kirche,  von  tüch- \r\ntigen Quadern  aufgeführt,  stehen  noch  unverletzt  in  ihrer \r\nanfänglichen  Tüchtigkeit.  Dem  sei  aber,  wie  ihm  wolle, \r\nMessinas  Anblick  ist  äußerst  verdrießlich  und  erinnert  an \r\ndie  Urzeiten,  wo  Sikaner  und  Sikuler  diesen  unruhigen \r\nErdboden  verließen  und  die  westliche  Küste  Siziliens \r\nbebauten. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  brachten  wir  unsern  Morgen  zu,  gingen  dann,  im \r\nGasthof  ein  frugales  Mahl  zu  verzehren.  Wir  saßen  noch \r\nganz  vergnügt  beisammen,  als  der  Bediente  des  Konsuls \r\natemlos  hereinsprang  und  mir  verkündigte,  der  Gouver- \r\nneur lasse  mich  in  der  ganzen  Stadt  suchen;  er  habe \r\nmich  zur  Tafel  geladen,  und  nun  bleibe  ich  aus.  Der \r\nKonsul  lasse  mich  aufs  inständigste  bitten,  auf  der  Stelle \r\nhinzugehen,  ich  möchte  gespeist  haben  oder  nicht,  möchte \r\naus  Vergessenheit  oder  aus  Vorsatz  die  Stunde  versäumt \r\nhaben.  Nun  fühlte  ich  erst  den  unglaublichen  Leichtsinn, \r\nwomit  ich  die  Einladung  des  Zyklopen  aus  dem  Sinne \r\ngeschlagen,  froh,  daß  ich  das  erstemal  entwischt.  Der \r\nBediente  ließ  mich  nicht  zaudern,  seine  Vorstellungen \r\n\r\n\r\n324  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwaren  die  dringendsten  und  triftigsten:  der  Konsul  ris- \r\nkiere, hieß  es,  daß  jener  wütende  Despot  ihn  und  die \r\nganze  Nation  auf  den  Kopf  stelle. \r\n\r\nIndessen  ich  nun  Haare  und  Kleider  zurechte  putzte, \r\nfaßte  ich  mir  ein  Herz  und  folgte  mit  heiterm  Sinne \r\nmeinem  Führer,  Odysseus  den  Patron  anrufend  und  mir \r\nseine  Vorsprache  bei  Pallas  Athene  erbittend. \r\nIn  der  Höhle  des  Löwen  angelangt,  ward  ich  vom  lusti- \r\ngen Laufer  in  einen  großen  Speisesaal  geführt,  wo  etwa \r\nvierzig  Personen,  ohne  daß  man  einen  Laut  vernommen \r\nhätte,  an  einer  länglichrunden  Tafel  saßen.  Der  Platz  zur \r\nRechten  des  Gouverneurs  war  often,  wohin  mich  der \r\nLaufer  geleitete. \r\n\r\nNachdem  ich  den  Hausherrn  und  die  Gäste  mit  einer \r\nVerbeugung  gegrüßt,  setzte  ich  mich  neben  ihn,  ent- \r\nschuldigte mein  Außenbleiben  mit  der  Weitläuftigkeit  der \r\nStadt  und  dem  Irrtum,  in  welchen  mich  die  ungewöhn- \r\nliche Stundenzahl  schon  mehrmals  geführt.  Er  versetzte \r\nmit  glühendem  Blick,  man  habe  sich  in  fremden  Landen \r\nnach  den  jedesmaligen  Gewohnheiten  zu  erkundigen  und \r\nzu  richten.  Ich  erwiderte,  dies  sei  jederzeit  mein  Be- \r\nstreben; nur  hätte  ich  gefunden,  daß  bei  den  besten  Vor- \r\nsätzen man  gewöhnlich  die  ersten  Tage,  wo  uns  ein  Ort \r\nnoch  neu  und  die  Verhältnisse  unbekannt  seien,  in  ge- \r\nwisse Fehler  verfalle,  welche  unverzeihlich  scheinen \r\nmüßten,  wenn  man  nicht  die  Ermüdung  der  Reise,  die \r\nZerstreuung  durch  Gegenstände,  die  Sorge  für  ein  leid- \r\nliches Unterkommen,  ja  sogar  für  eine  weitere  Reise  als \r\nGründe  der  Entschuldigung  möchte  gelten  lassen. \r\nEr  fragte  darauf,  wie  lange  ich  hier  zu  bleiben  gedächte. \r\nIch  versetzte,  daß  ich  mir  einen  recht  langen  Aufenthalt \r\nwünsche,  damit  ich  ihm  die  Dankbarkeit  für  die  mir  er- \r\nwiesene Gunst  durch  die  genauste  Befolgung  seiner  Be- \r\nfehle und  Anordnungen  betätigen  könnte.  Nach  einer \r\nPause  fragte  er  sodann,  was  ich  in  Messina  gesehen  habe. \r\nIch  erzählte  kürzlich  meinen  Morgen  mit  einigen  Bemer- \r\nkungen und  fügte  hinzu,  daß  ich  am  meisten  bewundert \r\ndie  Reinlichkeit  und  Ordnung  in  den  Straßen  dieser  zer- \r\nstörten Stadt.     Und  wirklich  war  bewunderungswürdig, \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  325 \r\n\r\nwie  man  die  sämtlichen  Straßen  von  Trümmern  scereinisft, \r\nindem  man  den  Schutt  in  die  zerfallenen  Mauerstätten \r\nselbst  geworfen,  die  Steine  dagegen  an  die  Häuser  an- \r\ngereiht und  dadurch  die  Mitte  der  Straßen  frei,  dem  Han- \r\ndel und  Wandel  offen  wieder  übergeben.  Hiebei  konnte \r\nich  dem  Ehrenmanne  mit  der  Wahrheit  schmeicheln,  in- \r\ndem ich  ihm  versicherte,  daß  alle  Messineser  dankbar  er- \r\nkennten, diese  Wohltat  seiner  Vorsorge  schuldig  zu  sein. \r\n• — Erkennen  sie  es?  brummte  er.  Haben  sie  doch  früher \r\ngenug  über  die  Härte  geschrien,  mit  der  man  sie  zu  ihrem \r\nVorteile  nötigen  mußte. — Ich  sprach  von  weisen  Absich- \r\nten der  Regierung,  von  höhern  Zwecken,  die  erst  später \r\neingesehen  und  geschätzt  werden  könnten,  und  der- \r\ngleichen. Er  fragte,  ob  ich  die  Jesuitenkirche  gesehen \r\nhabe,  welches  ich  verneinte;  worauf  er  mir  denn  zusagte, \r\ndaß  er  mir  sie  wolle  zeigen  lassen,  und  zwar  mit  allem \r\nZubehör. \r\n\r\nWährend  diesem  durch  wenige  Pausen  unterbrochenen \r\nGespräche  sah  ich  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  in  dem  tiefsten \r\nStillschweigen  nicht  mehr  sich  bewegen,  als  nötig,  die \r\nBissen  zum  Munde  zu  bringen.  Und  so  standen  sie,  als \r\ndie  Tafel  aufgehoben  und  der  Kaöee  gereicht  war,  wie \r\nWachspuppen  rings  an  den  Wänden.  Ich  ging  auf  den \r\nHausgeistlichen  los,  der  mir  die  Kirche  zeigen  sollte, \r\nihm  zum  voraus  für  seine  Bemühungen  zu  danken;  er \r\nwich  zur  Seite,  indem  er  demütig  versicherte,  die  Befehle \r\nIhro  Exzellenz  habe  er  ganz  allein  vor  Augen.  Ich  redete \r\ndarauf  einen  jungen  nebenstehenden  Fremden  an,  dem \r\nes  auch,  ob  er  gleich  ein  Franzose  war,  nicht  ganz  wohl \r\nin  seiner  Haut  zu  sein  schien;  denn  auch  er  war  ver- \r\nstummt und  erstarrt  wie  die  ganze  Gesellschaft,  worunter \r\nich  mehrere  Gesichter  sah,  die  der  gestrigen  Szene  mit \r\ndem  Malteserritter  bedenklich  beigewohnt  hatten. \r\nDer  Gouverneur  entfernte  sich,  und  nach  einiger  Zeit \r\nsagte  mir  der  Geistliche,  es  sei  nun  an  der  Stunde,  zu \r\ngehen.  Ich  folgte  ihm,  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  hatte  sich \r\nstille,  stille  verloren.  Er  führte  mich  an  das  Portal  der \r\nJesuitenkirche,  das,  nach  der  bekannten  Architektur  dieser \r\nVäter,  prunkhaft  und  wirklich  imposant  in  die  Luft  steht. \r\n\r\n\r\nJ2  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  n \r\n\r\nP2in  Schließer  kam  uns  schon  entgegen  und  lud  zum  Ein- \r\ntritt; der  Geistliche  hingegen  hielt  mich  zurück  mit  der \r\nWeisung,  daß  wir  zuvor  auf  den  Gouverneur  zu  warten \r\nhätten.  Dieser  fuhr  auch  bald  heran,  hielt  auf  dem  Platze \r\nohnfern  der  Kirche  und  winkte,  worauf  wir  drei  ganz  nah \r\nan  seinem  Kutschenschlag  uns  vereinigten.  Er  gebot  dem \r\nSchließer,  daß  er  mir  nicht  allein  die  Kirche  in  allen \r\nihren  Teilen  zeigen,  sondern  auch  die  Geschichte  der \r\nAltäre  und  anderer  Stiftungen  umständlich  erzählen  solle; \r\nferner  habe  er  auch  die  Sakristeien  aufzuschließen  und \r\nmich  auf  alles  das  darin  enthaltene  Merkwürdige  auf- \r\nmerksam zu  machen.  Ich  sei  ein  Mann,  den  er  ehren \r\nwolle,  der  alle  Ursache  haben  solle,  in  seinem  Vaterlande \r\nrühmlich  von  Messina  zu  sprechen.  Versäumen  Sie  nicht, \r\nsagte  er  darauf  zu  mir  gewandt  mit  einem  Lächeln,  inso- \r\nfern seine  Züge  dessen  fähig  waren,  versäumen  Sie  nicht, \r\nsolange  Sie  hier  sind,  zur  rechten  Stunde  an  Tafel  zu \r\nkommen,  Sie  sollen  immer  wohl  empfangen  sein. — Ich \r\nhatte  kaum  Zeit,  ihm  hierauf  verehrlich  zu  erwidern.  Der \r\nWagen  bewegte  sich  fort. \r\n\r\nVon  diesem  Augenblick  an  ward  auch  der  Geistliche \r\nheiterer;  wir  traten  in  die  Kirche.  Der  Kastellan,  wie \r\nman  ihn  wohl  in  diesem  entgottesdiensteten  Zauber- \r\npalaste nennen  dürfte,  schickte  sich  an,  die  ihm  scharf \r\nempfohlene  Pflicht  zu  erfüllen,  als  der  Konsul  und  Kniep \r\nin  das  leere  Heiligtum  hereinstürzten,  mich  umarmten \r\nund  eine  leidenschaftliche  Freude  ausdrückten,  mich,  den \r\nsie  schon  in  Gewahrsam  geglaubt,  wiederzusehen.  Sie \r\nhatten  in  Höllenangst  gesessen,  bis  der  gewandte  Laufer, \r\nwahrscheinlich  vom  Konsul  gut  pensioniert,  einen  glück- \r\nlichen Ausgang  des  Abenteuers  unter  hundert  Possen  er- \r\nzählte, worauf  denn  ein  erheiternder  Frohsinn  sich  über \r\ndie  beiden  ergoß,  die  mich  sogleich  aufsuchten,  als  die \r\nAufmerksamkeit  des  Gouverneurs  wegen  der  Kirche  ihnen \r\nbekannt  geworden. \r\n\r\nIndessen  standen  wir  vor  dem  Hochaltare,  die  Auslegung \r\nalter  Kostbarkeiten  vernehmend.  Säulen  von  Lapis  La- \r\nzuli,  durch  bronzene,  vergoldete  Stäbe  gleichsam  kan- \r\nneliert, nach  florentinischer  Art  eingelegte  Pilaster  und \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  17  87  327 \r\n\r\nFüllungen;  die  prächtigen  sizilianischen  Achate  in  Über- \r\nfluß, Erz  und  Vergoldung  sich  wiederholend  und  alles \r\nverbindend. \r\n\r\nNun  war  es  aber  eine  wunderbare  kontrapunktische  Fuge, \r\nwenn  Kniep  und  der  Konsul  die  Verlegenheit  des  Aben- \r\nteuers, der  Vorzeiger  dagegen  die  Kostbarkeiten  der \r\nnoch  wohl  erhaltenen  Pracht  verschränkt  vortrugen,  beide \r\nvon  ihrem  Gegenstand  durchdrungen;  wobei  ich  denn  das \r\ndoppelte  Vergnügen  hatte,  den  Wert  meines  glücklichen \r\nEntkommens  zu  fühlen  und  zugleich  die  sizilianischen \r\nGebirgsprodukte,  um  die  ich  mir  schon  manche  Mühe \r\ngegeben,  architektonisch  angewendet  zu  sehen. \r\nDie  genaue  Kenntnis  der  einzelnen  Teile,  woraus  dieser \r\nPrunk  zusammengesetzt  war,  verhalf  mir  zur  Entdeckung, \r\ndaß  der  sogenannte  Lapis  Lazuli  jener  Säulen  eigentlich \r\nnur  Calcara  sei,  aber  freilich  von  so  schöner  Farbe,  als \r\nich  sie  noch  nicht  gesehn,  und  herrlich  zusammengefügt. \r\nAber  auch  so  blieben  diese  Säulen  noch  immer  ehrwür- \r\ndig; denn  es  setzt  eine  ungeheure  Menge  jenes  Materials \r\nvoraus,  um  Stücke  von  so  schöner  und  gleicher  Farbe \r\naussuchen  zu  können,  und  dann  ist  die  Bemühung  des \r\nSchneidens,  Schleifens  und  Polierens  höchst  bedeutend. \r\nDoch  was  war  jenen  Vätern  unüberwindlich? \r\nDer  Konsul  hatte  indessen  nicht  aufgehört,  mich  über \r\nmein  bedrohliches  Schicksal  aufzuklären.  Der  Gouver- \r\nneur nämlich,  mit  sich  selbst  unzufrieden,  daß  ich  von \r\nseinem  gewaltsamen  Betragen  gegen  den  Quasi-Malteser \r\ngleich  beim  ersten  Eintritt  Zeuge  gewesen,  habe  sich \r\nvorgenommen,  mich  besonders  zu  ehren,  und  sich  dar- \r\nüber einen  Plan  festgesetzt;  dieser  habe  durch  mein  Außen- \r\nbleiben gleich  zu  Anfang  der  Ausführung  einen  Strich \r\nerlitten.  Nach  langem  Warten  sich  endlich  zur  Tafel \r\nsetzend,  habe  der  Despot  sein  ungeduldiges  Mißvergnü- \r\ngen nicht  verbergen  können,  und  die  Gesellschaft  sei  in \r\nFurcht  gestanden,  entweder  bei  meinem  Kommen  oder \r\nnach  aufgehobener  Tafel  eine  Szene  zu  erleben. \r\nIndessen  suchte  der  Küster  immer  wieder  das  Wort  zu \r\nerhaschen,  öfifnete  die  geheimen  Räume,  nach  schönen \r\nVerhältnissen  gebaut,  anständig,  ja  prächtig  verziert;  auch \r\n\r\n\r\n328  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  n \r\n\r\nwar  darin  noch  manches  bewegliche  Kirchengeräte  übrig \r\ngeblieben,  dem  Ganzen  gemäß  gefonnt  und  geputzt.  Von \r\nedlen  Metallen  sah  ich  nichts,  so  wenig  als  von  altern \r\nund  neuern  echten  Kunstwerken. \r\n\r\nUnsere  italienisch-deutsche  Fuge — denn  Pater  und  Küster \r\npsalmodierten  in  der  ersten,  Kniep  und  Konsul  in  der \r\nzweiten  Sprache— neigte  sich  zu  Ende,  als  ein  Offizier \r\nsich  zu  uns  gesellte,  den  ich  bei  Tafel  gesehen.  Er  ge- \r\nhörte zum  Gefolge  des  Gouverneurs.  Dies  konnte  wieder \r\neinige  Besorgnis  erregen,  besonders  da  er  sich  erbot, \r\nmich  an  den  Hafen  zu  führen,  wo  er  mich  an  Punkte \r\nbringen  wolle,  die  Fremden  sonst  unzugänglich  seien. \r\nMeine  Freunde  sahen  sich  an;  ich  ließ  mich  jedoch  nicht \r\nabhalten,  allein  mit  ihm  zu  gehen.  Nach  einigen  gleich- \r\ngültigen Gesprächen  begann  ich  ihn  zutraulich  anzureden \r\nund  gestand,  bei  Tafel  gar  wohl  bemerkt  zu  haben,  daß \r\nmehrere  stille  Beisitzer  mir  durch  ein  freundliches  Zei- \r\nchen zu  verstehen  gegeben,  daß  ich  nicht  unter  welt- \r\nfremden Menschen  allein,  sondern  unter  Freunden,  ja \r\nBrüdern  mich  befinde  und  deshalb  nichts  zu  besorgen \r\nhabe.  Ich  halte  für  Pflicht,  ihm  zu  danken  und  um  Er- \r\nstattung gleichen  Danks  an  die  übrigen  Freunde  zu  er- \r\nsuchen. Hierauf  erwiderte  derselbe,  daß  sie  mich  um  so \r\nmehr  zu  beruhigen  gesucht,  als  sie  bei  Kenntnis  der  Ge- \r\nmütsart ihres  Vorgesetzten  für  mich  eigentlich  nichts  be- \r\nfürchtet hätten;  denn  eine  Explosion  wie  die  gegen  den \r\nMalteser  sei  nur  selten,  und  gerade  wegen  einer  solchen \r\nmache  sich  der  würdige  Greis  selbst  Vorwürfe,  hüte  sich \r\nlange,  lebe  dann  eine  Weile  in  einer  sorglosen  Sicherheit \r\nseiner  Pflicht,  bis  er  denn  endlich,  durch  einen  unerwar- \r\nteten Vorfall  überrascht,  wieder  zu  neuen  Heftigkeiten \r\nhingerissen  werde.  Der  wackere  Freund  setzte  hinzu, \r\ndaß  ihm  und  seinen  Genossen  nichts  wünschenswerter \r\nwäre,  als  mit  mir  sich  genauer  zu  verbinden;  weshalb \r\nich  die  Gefälligkeit  haben  mochte,  mich  näher  zu  be- \r\nzeichnen, wozu  sich  heute  nacht  die  beste  Gelegenheit \r\nfinden  werde.  Ich  wich  diesem  Verlangen  höflich  aus, \r\nindem  ich  ihn  bat,  mir  eine  Grille  zu  verzeihen:  ich \r\nWünsche  nämlich  auf  Reisen  bloß  als  Mensch  angesehen \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  329 \r\n\r\nzu  werden;  könne  ich  als  ein  solcher  Vertrauen  erregen \r\nund  Teilnahme  erlangen,  so  sei  es  mir  angenehm  und \r\nerwünscht;  in  andere  Verhältnisse  einzugehen,  verböten \r\nmir  mancherlei  Gründe. \r\n\r\nÜberzeugen  wollt  ich  ihn  nicht;  denn  ich  durfte  ja  nicht \r\nsagen,  was  eigentlich  mein  Grund  war.  Merkwürdig  ge- \r\nnug aber  schien  mirs,  wie  schön  und  unschuldig  die \r\nwohldenkenden  Männer  unter  einem  despotischen  Regi- \r\nment sich  zu  eignem  und  zu  der  Fremdlinge  Schutz  ver- \r\nbündet hatten.  Ich  verhehlte  ihm  nicht,  daß  ich  ihre \r\nVerhältnisse  zu  andern  deutschen  Reisenden  recht  wohl \r\nkenne,  verbreitete  mich  über  die  löblichen  Zwecke,  die \r\nerreicht  werden  sollten,  und  setzte  ihn  immer  mehr  in \r\nErstaunen  über  meine  vertrauliche  Hartnäckigkeit.  Er \r\nversuchte  alles  mögliche,  mich  aus  meinem  Inkognito \r\nhervorzuziehen,  welches  ihm  nicht  gelang,  teils  weil  ich, \r\neiner  Gefahr  entronnen,  mich  nicht  zwecklos  in  eine \r\nandere  begeben  konnte,  teils  weil  ich  gar  wohl  bemerkte, \r\ndie  Ansichten  dieser  wackern  Insulaner  seien  von  den \r\nmeinigen  so  sehr  verschieden,  daß  ihnen  mein  näherer \r\nUmgang  weder  Freude  noch  Trost  bringen  könne. \r\nDagegen  wurden  abends  mit  dem  teilnehmenden  und \r\ntätigen  Konsul  noch  einige  Stunden  verbracht,  der  denn \r\nauch  die  Szene  mit  dem  Malteser  aufklärte.  Es  sei  dieser \r\nzwar  kein  eigentlicher  Abenteurer,  aber  ein  unruhiger \r\nOrtwechsler.  Der  Gouverneur,  aus  einer  großen  Familie, \r\nwegen  Ernst  und  Tüchtigkeit  verehrt,  wegen  bedeutender \r\nDienste  geschätzt,  stehe  doch  im  Rufe  unbegrenzten \r\nEigenwillens,  zaumloser  Heftigkeit  und  ehernen  Starr- \r\nsinns. Argwöhnisch  als  Greis  und  Despot,  mehr  besorgt \r\nals  überzeugt,  daß  er  Feinde  bei  Hofe  habe,  hasse  er \r\nsolche  hin  und  wider  ziehende  Figuren,  die  er  durchaus \r\nfür  Spione  halte.  Diesmal  sei  ihm  der  Rotrock  in  die \r\nQuer  gekommen,  da  er  nach  einer  ziemlichen  Pause  sich \r\nwieder  einmal  im  Zorn  habe  ergehen  müssen,  um  die \r\nLeber  zu  befreien. \r\n\r\nMessina  und  auf  der  See,  Ff-eitag  den  11.  Mai. \r\nBeide  wir  erwachten  mit  gleicher  Empfindung,  verdrieß- \r\n\r\n\r\n33 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  n \r\n\r\nlieh,  daß  wir,  durch  den  ersten  wüsten  Anblick  von  Mes- \r\nsina zur  Ungeduld  gereizt,  uns  entschlossen  hatten,  mit \r\ndem  französischen  Kauffahrer  die  Rückfahrt  abzuschließen. \r\nNach  dem  glücklich  beendigten  Abenteuer  mit  dem  Gou- \r\nverneur, bei  dem  Verhältnis  zu  wackern  Männern,  denen \r\nich  mich  nur  näher  zu  bezeichnen  brauchte,  aus  dem \r\nBesuch  bei  meinem  Bankier,  der  auf  dem  Lande  in  der \r\nangenehmsten  Gegend  wohnte,  ließ  sich  für  einen  längern \r\nAufenthalt  in  Messina  das  Angenehmste  hoffen.  Kniep, \r\nvon  ein  paar  hübschen  Kindern  wohl  unterhalten,  wünschte \r\nnichts  mehr  als  die  längere  Dauer  des  sonst  verhaßten \r\nGegenwindes.  Indessen  war  die  Lage  unangenehm:  alles \r\nmußte  gepackt  bleiben  und  wir  jeden  Augenblick  bereit \r\nsein,  zu  scheiden. \r\n\r\nSo  geschah  denn  auch  dieser  Aufruf  gegen  Mittag;  wir \r\neilten  an  Bord  und  fanden  unter  der  am  Ufer  versam- \r\nmelten Menge  auch  unsern  guten  Konsul,  von  dem  wir \r\ndankbar  Abschied  nahmen.  Der  gelbe  Laufer  drängte \r\nsich  auch  herbei,  seine  Ergötzlichkeiten  abzuholen.  Dieser \r\nward  nun  belohnt  und  beauftragt,  seinem  Herrn  unsere \r\nAbreise  zu  melden  und  mein  Außenbleiben  von  Tafel  zu \r\nentschuldigen.  Wer  absegelt,  ist  entschuldigt!  rief  er  aus; \r\nsodann,  mit  einem  seltsamen  Sprung  sich  umkehrend,  war \r\ner  verschwunden. \r\n\r\nIm  Schiffe  selbst  sah  es  nun  anders  aus  als  auf  der  nea- \r\npohtanischen  Korvette,  doch  beschäftigte  uns,  bei  all- \r\nmählicher Entfernung  vom  Ufer,  die  herrliche  Ansicht \r\ndes  Palastzirkels,  der  Zitadelle,  der  hinter  der  Stadt  auf- \r\nsteigenden Berge.  Kalabrien  an  der  andern  Seite.  Nun \r\nder  freie  Blick  in  die  Meerenge  nord-  und  südwärts,  bei \r\neiner  ausgedehnten,  an  beiden  Seiten  schön  beuferten \r\nBreite.  Als  wir  dieses  nach  und  nach  anstaunten,  ließ \r\nman  uns  links,  in  ziemlicher  Ferne,  einige  Bewegung  im \r\nWasser,  rechts  aber,  etwas  näher,  einen  vom  Ufer  sich \r\nauszeichnenden  Felsen  bemerken,  jene  als  Charybdis, \r\ndiesen  als  Szylla.  Man  hat  sich  bei  Gelegenheit  beider, \r\nin  der  Natur  so  weit  auseinander  stehenden,  von  dem \r\nDichter  so  nah  zusammen  gerückten  Merkwürdigkeiten \r\nüber  die  Fabelei  der  Poeten  beschwert  und  nicht  bedacht. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  331 \r\n\r\ndaß  die  Einbildungskraft  aller  Menschen  durchaus  Ge- \r\ngenstände, wenn  sie  sich  solche  bedeutend  vorstellen \r\nwill,  höher  als  breit  imaginiert  und  dadurch  dem  Bilde \r\nmehr  Charakter,  Ernst  und  Würde  verschafft.  Tausend- \r\nmal habe  ich  klagen  hören,  daß  ein  durch  Erzählung  ge- \r\nkannter Gegenstand  in  der  Gegenwart  nicht  mehr  be- \r\nfriedige; die  Ursache  hievon  ist  immer  dieselbe:  Ein- \r\nbildung und  Gegenwart  verhalten  sich  wie  Poesie  und \r\nProsa,  jene  wird  die  Gegenstände  mächtig  und  steil  den- \r\nken, diese  sich  immer  in  die  Fläche  verbreiten.  Land- \r\nschaftsmaler des  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts,  gegen  die \r\nunsrigen  gehalten,  geben  das  auffallendste  Beispiel.  Eine \r\nZeichnung  von  Jodocus  Momper  neben  einem  Kniepschen \r\nKontur  würden  den  ganzen  Kontrast  sichtbar  machen. \r\nMit  solchen  und  ähnlichen  Gesprächen  unterhielten  wir \r\nuns,  indem  selbst  für  Kniep  die  Küsten,  welche  zu  zeich- \r\nnen er  schon  Anstalt  getroffen  hatte,  nicht  reizend  genug \r\nwaren. \r\n\r\nMich  aber  befiel  abermals  die  unangenehme  Empfindung \r\nder  Seekrankheit,  und  hier  war  dieser  Zustand  nicht  wie \r\nbei  der  Überfahrt  durch  bequeme  Absonderung  gemil- \r\ndert; doch  fand  sich  die  Kajüte  groß  genug,  um  mehrere \r\nPersonen  einzunehmen,  auch  an  guten  Matratzen  war \r\nkein  Mangel.  Ich  nahm  die  horizontale  Stellung  wieder \r\nan,  in  welcher  mich  Kniep  gar  vorsorglich  mit  rotem \r\nWein  und  gutem  Brot  ernährte.  In  dieser  Lage  wollte \r\nmir  unsere  ganze  sizilianische  Reise  in  keinem  angeneh- \r\nmen Lichte  erscheinen.  Wir  hatten  doch  eigentlich  nichts \r\ngesehen  als  durchaus  eitle  Bemühungen  des  Menschen- \r\ngeschlechts, sich  gegen  die  Gewaltsamkeit  der  Natur, \r\ngegen  die  hämische  Tücke  der  Zeit  und  gegen  den  Groll \r\nihrer  eigenen  feindseligen  Spaltungen  zu  erhalten.  Die \r\nKarthager,  Griechen  und  Römer  und  so  viele  nachfol- \r\ngende Völkerschaften  haben  gebaut  und  zerstört.  Selinunt \r\nliegt  methodisch  umgeworfen;  die  Tempel  von  Girgenti \r\nniederzulegen  waren  zwei  Jahrtausende  nicht  hinrei- \r\nchend, Catania  und  Messina  zu  verderben  wenige  Stun- \r\nden, wo  nicht  gar  Augenblicke.  Diese  wahrhaft  seekran- \r\nken Betrachtungen  eines  auf  der  Woge  des  Lebens  hin \r\n\r\n\r\n332  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nund  wider  Geschaukelten  ließ  ich  nicht  Herrschaft  ge- \r\nwinnen. \r\n\r\nAuf  der  See,  Sonnabend  den  12.  Mai. \r\nMeine  Hoffnung,  diesmal  schneller  nach  Neapel  zu  ge- \r\nlangen oder  von  der  Seekrankheit  eher  befreit  zu  sein, \r\nwar  nicht  eingetroffen.  Verschiedenemal  versuchte  ich, \r\ndurch  Kniep  angeregt,  auf  das  Verdeck  zu  treten,  allein \r\nder  Genuß  eines  so  mannigfaltigen  Schönen  war  mir \r\nversagt;  nur  einige  Vorfälle  ließen  mich  meinen  Schwin- \r\ndel vergessen.  Der  ganze  Himmel  war  mit  einem  weiß- \r\nlichen Wolkendunst  umzogen,  durch  welchen  die  Sonne, \r\nohne  daß  man  ihr  Bild  hätte  unterscheiden  können,  das \r\nMeer  überleuchtete,  welches  die  schönste  Himmelsbläue \r\nzeigte,  die  man  nur  sehen  kann.  Eine  Schar  Delphine \r\nbegleitete  das  Schiff,  schwimmend  und  springend  blieben \r\nsie  ihm  immer  gleich.  Mich  deucht,  sie  hatten  das  aus \r\nder  Tiefe  und  Ferne  ihnen  als  ein  schwarzer  Punkt  er- \r\nscheinende Schwimmgebäude  für  irgend  einen  Raub  und \r\nwillkommene  Zehrung  gehalten.  Vom  Schiff  aus  wenig- \r\nstens behandelte  man  sie  nicht  als  Geleitsmänner,  son- \r\ndern wie  Feinde:  einer  ward  mit  dem  Harpun  getroffen, \r\naber  nicht  herangebracht. \r\n\r\nDer  Wind  blieb  ungünstig,  den  unser  Schiff,  in  verschie- \r\ndenen Richtungen  fortstreichend,  nur  überlisten  konnte. \r\nDieUngeduld  hierüber  ward  vermehrt,  als  einige  erfahrne \r\nReisende  versicherten:  weder  Hauptmann  noch  Steurer \r\nverstünden  ilir  Handwerk;  jener  möge  wohl  als  Kaufmann, \r\ndieser  als  Matrose  gelten,  für  den  Wert  so  vieler  Men- \r\nschen und  Güter  seien  sie  nicht  geeignet  einzustehen. \r\nIch  ersuchte  diese  übrigens  braven  Personen,  ihre  Be- \r\nsorgnisse geheim  zu  halten.  Die  Anzahl  der  Passagiere \r\nwar  groß,  darunter  Weiber  und  Kinder  von  verschiedenem \r\nAlter;  denn  alles  hatte  sich  auf  das  französische  Fahrzeug \r\ngedrängt,  die  Sicherheit  der  weißen  Flagge  vor  Seeräu- \r\nbern, sonst  nichts  weiter  bedenkend.  Ich  stellte  vor,  daß \r\nMißtrauen  und  Sorge  jeden  in  die  peinlichste  Lage  ver- \r\nsetzen würde,  da  bis  jetzt  alle  in  der  färb-  und  wappen- \r\nlosen Leinwand  ihr  Heil  gesehen. \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  333 \r\n\r\nUnd  wirklich  ist  zwischen  Himmel  und  Meer  dieser  weiße \r\nZipfel  als  entscheidender  Talisman  merkwürdig  genug. \r\nWie  sich  Abfahrende  und  Zurückbleibende  noch  mit  ge- \r\nschwungenen weißen  Taschentüchern  begrüßen  und  da- \r\ndurch wechselseitig  ein  sonst  nie  zu  empfindendes  Ge- \r\nfühl der  scheidenden  Freundschaft  und  Neigung  erregen, \r\nso  ist  hier  in  dieser  einfachen  Fahne  der  Ursprung  ge- \r\nheiligt; eben  als  wenn  einer  sein  Taschentuch  an  eine \r\nStange  befestigte,  um  der  ganzen  Welt  anzukündigen,  es \r\nkomme  ein  Freund  über  Meer. \r\n\r\nMit  Wein  und  Brot  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  erquickt,  zum  Ver- \r\ndruß des  Hauptmanns,  welcher  verlangte,  daß  ich  essen \r\nsollte,  was  ich  bezahlt  hatte,  konnte  ich  doch  auf  dem \r\nVerdeck  sitzen  und  an  mancher  Unterhaltung  teilnehmen. \r\nKniep  wußte  mich  zu  erheitern,  indem  er  nicht,  wie  auf \r\nder  Korvette,  über  die  vortreffliche  Kost  triumphierend \r\nmeinen  Neid  zu  erregen  suchte,  mich  vielmehr  diesmal \r\nglücklich  pries,  daß  ich  keinen  Appetit  habe. \r\n\r\nMontag  den  14.  Mai. \r\nUnd  so  war  der  Nachmittag  vorbeigegangen,  ohne  daß \r\nwir  unsern  Wünschen  gemäß  in  den  Golf  von  Neapel \r\neingefahren  wären.  Wir  wurden  vielmehr  immer  west- \r\nwärts getrieben,  und  das  Schiff,  indem  es  sich  der  Insel \r\nCapri  näherte,  entfernte  sich  immer  mehr  von  dem  Kap \r\nMinerva.  Jedermann  war  verdrießlich  und  ungeduldig: \r\nwir  beiden  aber,  die  wir  die  Welt  mit  malerischen  Augen \r\nbetrachteten,  konnten  damit  sehr  zufrieden  sein;  denn \r\nbei  Sonnenuntergang  genossen  wir  des  herrlichsten  An- \r\nblicks, den  uns  die  ganze  Reise  gewährt  hatte.  In  dem \r\nglänzendsten  Farbenschmuck  lag  Kap  Minerva  mit  den \r\ndaranstoßenden  Gebirgen  vor  unsern  Augen,  indes  die \r\nFelsen,  die  sich  südwärts  hinabziehen,  schon  einen  blau- \r\nlichen Ton  angenommen  hatten.  Vom  Kap  an  zog  sich \r\ndie  ganze  erleuchtete  Küste  bis  Sorrent  hin.  Der  Vesuv \r\nwar  uns  sichtbar,  eine  ungeheure  Dampfwolke  über  ihm \r\naufgetürmt,  von  der  sich  ostwärts  ein  langer  Streif  weit \r\nhinzog,  so  daß  wir  den  stärksten  Ausbruch  vermuten \r\nkonnten.  Links  lag  Capri,  steil  in  die  Höhe  strebend;  die \r\n\r\n\r\n334  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nFormen  seiner  Felswände  konnten  wir  durch  den  durch- \r\nsichtigen bläulichen  Dunst  vollkommen  unterscheiden. \r\nUnter  einem  ganz  reinen,  wolkenlosen  Himmel  glänzte \r\ndas  ruhige,  kaum  bewegte  Meer,  das,  bei  einer  völligen \r\nWindstille,  endlich  wie  ein  klarer  Teich  vor  uns  lag.  Wir \r\nentzückten  uns  an  dem  Anblick,  Kniep  trauerte,  daß  alle \r\nFarbenkunst  nicht  hinreiche,  diese  Harmonie  wiederzu- \r\ngeben, so  wie  der  feinste  englische  Bleistift  die  geübteste \r\nHand  nicht  in  den  Stand  setze,  diese  Linien  nachzu- \r\nziehen. Ich  dagegen,  überzeugt,  daß  ein  weit  geringeres \r\nAndenken,  als  dieser  geschickte  Künstler  zu  erhalten \r\nvermochte,  in  der  Zukunft  höchst  wünschenswert  sein \r\nwürde,  ich  ermunterte  ihn,  Hand  und  Auge  zum  letzten- \r\nmal anzustrengen;  er  ließ  sich  bereden  und  lieferte  eine \r\nder  genausten  Zeichnungen,  die  er  nachher  kolorierte  und \r\nein  Beispiel  zurückließ,  daß  bildlicher  Darstellung  das \r\nUnmögliche  möglich  wird.  Den  Übergang  vom  Abend \r\nzur  Nacht  verfolgten  wir  mit  ebenso  begierigen  Augen. \r\nCapri  lag  nun  ganz  finster  vor  uns,  und  zu  unserm  Er- \r\nstaunen entzündete  sich  die  Vesuvische  Wolke  sowie \r\nauch  der  Wolkenstreif  je  länger  je  mehr,  und  wir  sahen \r\nzuletzt  einen  ansehnlichen  Strich  der  Atmosphäre  im \r\nGrunde  unseres  Bildes  erleuchtet,  ja  wetterleuchten. \r\nÜber  diese  uns  so  willkommenen  Szenen  hatten  wir  un- \r\nbemerkt gelassen,  daß  uns  ein  großes  Unheil  bedrohe; \r\ndoch  ließ  uns  die  Bewegung  unter  den  Passagieren  nicht \r\nlange  in  Ungewißheit.  Sie,  der  Meeresereignisse  kun- \r\ndiger als  wir,  machten  dem  Schiftsherrn  und  seinem \r\nSteuermanne  bittre  Vorwürfe,  daß  über  ihre  Ungeschick- \r\nlichkeit nicht  allein  die  Meerenge  verfehlt  sei,  sondern \r\nauch  die  ihnen  anvertraute  Personenzahl,  Güter  und  alles \r\numzukommen  in  Gefahr  schwebe.  Wir  erkundigten  uns \r\nnach  der  Ursache  dieser  Unruhe,  indem  wir  nicht  be- \r\ngriffen, daß  bei  völliger  Windstille  irgend  ein  Unheil  zu \r\nbefürchten  sei.  Aber  eben  diese  Windstille  machte  jene \r\nMänner  trostlos:  wir  befinden  uns,  sagten  sie,  schon  in \r\nder  Strömung,  die  sich  um  die  Insel  bewegi.  und  durch \r\neinen  sonderbaren  Wellenschlag  so  lang.sara  als  unwider- \r\nstehlich nach  den  schroffen  Felsen  hinzieht,  wo  uns  auch \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  335 \r\n\r\nnicht  ein  Fußbreit  Vorsprung  oder  Bucht  zur  Rettung  ge- \r\ngeben ist. \r\n\r\nAufmerksam  durch  diese  Reden,  betrachteten  wir  nun \r\nunser  Schicksal  mit  Grauen;  denn  obgleich  die  Nacht  die \r\nzunehmende  Gefahr  nicht  unterscheiden  ließ,  so  bemerk- \r\nten wir  doch,  daß  das  Schiff,  schwankend  und  schwippend, \r\nsich  den  Felsen  näherte,  die  immer  finsterer  vor  uns \r\nstanden,  während  über  das  Meer  hin  noch  ein  leichter \r\nAbendschimmer  verbreitet  lag.  Nicht  die  geringste  Be- \r\nwegung war  in  der  Luft  zu  bemerken.  Schnupftücher  und \r\nleichte  Bänder  wurden  von  jedem  in  die  Höhe  und  ins \r\nFreie  gehalten,  aber  keine  Andeutung  eines  erwünschten \r\nHauches  zeigte  sich.  Die  Menge  ward  immer  lauter  und \r\nwilder.  Nicht  etwa  betend  knieten  die  Weiber  mit  ihren \r\nKindern  auf  dem  Verdeck,  sondern,  weil  der  Raum  zu \r\neng  war,  sich  darauf  zu  bewegen,  lagen  sie  gedrängt  an- \r\neinander. Sie  noch  mehr  als  die  Männer,  welche  beson- \r\nnen auf  Hülfe  und  Rettung  dachten,  schalten  und  tobten \r\ngegen  den  Kapitän.  Nun  ward  ihm  alles  vorgeworfen, \r\nwas  man  auf  der  ganzen  Reise  schweigend  zu  erinnern \r\ngehabt:  für  teures  Geld  einen  schlechten  Schiffsraum, \r\ngeringe  Kost,  ein  zwar  nicht  unfreundliches,  aber  doch \r\nstummes  Betragen.  Er  hatte  niemand  von  seinen  Hand- \r\nlungen Rechenschaft  gegeben,  ja  selbst  noch  den  letzten \r\nAbend  ein  hartnäckiges  Stillschweigen  über  seine  Ma- \r\nnövres  beobachtet.  Nun  hieß  er  und  der  Steuermann \r\nhergelaufene  Krämer,  die,  ohne  Kenntnis  der  Schifi'kunst, \r\nsich  aus  bloßem  Eigennutz  den  Besitz  eines  Fahrzeuges \r\nzu  verschaffen  gewußt  und  nun  durch  Unfähigkeit  und \r\nUngeschicklichkeit  alle,  die  ihnen  anvertraut,  zugrunde \r\nrichteten.  Der  Hauptmann  schwieg  und  schien  immer \r\nnoch  auf  Rettung  zu  sinnen;  mir  aber,  dem  von  Jugend \r\nauf  Anarchie  verdrießlicher  gewesen  als  der  Tod  selbst, \r\nwar  es  unmöglich,  länger  zu  schweigen.  Ich  trat  vor  sie \r\nhin  und  redete  ihnen  zu,  mit  ungefähr  ebensoviel  Ge- \r\nmütsruhe als  den  Vögeln  von  Malcesine.  Ich  stellte  ihnen \r\nvor,  daß  gerade  in  diesem  x\\ugenblick  ihr  Lärmen  und \r\nSchreien  denen,  von  welchen  noch  allein  Rettung  zu \r\nhoffen  sei,  Ohr  und  Kopf  verwirrten,  so  daß  sie  weder \r\n\r\n\r\n336  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ndenken  noch  sich  untereinander  verständigen  könnten.- \r\nWas  euch  betrifft,  rief  ich  aus,  kehrt  in  euch  selbst  zu- \r\nrück und  dann  wendet  euer  brünstiges  Gebet  zur  Mutter \r\nGottes,  auf  die  es  ganz  allein  ankommt,  ob  sie  sich  bei \r\nihrem  Sohne  verwenden  mag,  daß  er  für  euch  tue,  was \r\ner  damals  für  seine  Apostel  getan,  als  auf  dem  stürmen- \r\nden See  Tiberias  die  Wellen  schon  in  das  Schiff  schlugen, \r\nder  Hen-  aber  schlief;  der  jedoch,  als  ihn  die  Trost-  und \r\nHülf losen  aufweckten,  sogleich  dem  Winde  zu  ruhen  ge- \r\nbot, wie  er  jetzt  der  Luft  gebieten  kann,  sich  zu  regen, \r\nwenn  es  anders  sein  heiliger  Wille  ist. \r\nDiese  Worte  taten  die  beste  Wirkung.  Eine  unter  den \r\nFrauen,  mit  der  ich  mich  schon  früher  über  sittliche  und \r\ngeistliche  Gegenstände  unterhalten  hatte,  rief  aus:  Ah! \r\n11  Barlame!  benedetto  il  Barlame!  Und  wirklich  fingen \r\nsie,  da  sie  ohnehin  schon  auf  denKnieen  lagen,  ihre  Lita- \r\nneien mit  mehr  als  herkömmlicher  Inbrunst  leidenschaft- \r\nlich zu  beten  an.  Sie  konnten  dies  mit  desto  größerer \r\nBeruhigung  tun,  als  die  Schiftsieute  noch  ein  Rettungs- \r\nmittel  versuchten,  das  wenigstens  in  die  Augen  fallend \r\nwar:  sie  ließen  das  Boot  hinunter,  das  freilich  nur  sechs \r\nbis  acht  Männer  fassen  konnte,  befestigten  es  durch  ein \r\nlanges  Seil  an  das  Schiff\",  welches  die  Matrosen  durch \r\nRuderschläge  nach  sich  zu  ziehen  kräftig  bemüht  waren. \r\nAuch  glaubte  man  einen  Augenblick,  daß  sie  es  innerhalb \r\nder  Strömung  bewegten,  und  hoftite  es  bald  aus  derselben \r\nherausgerettet  zu  sehen.  Ob  aber  gerade  diese  Bemühun- \r\ngen die  Gcgengewalt  der  Strömung  vermehrt  oder  wie \r\nes  damit  beschaffen  sein  mochte,  so  ward  mit  einmal  an \r\ndem  langen  Seile  das  Boot  und  seine  Mannschaft  im  Bogen \r\nrückwärts  nach  dem  Schiffe  geschleudert,  wie  die  Schmitze \r\neiner  Peitsche,  wenn  der  Fuhrmann  einen  Zug  tut.  Auch \r\ndiese  Hoffnung  ward  aufgegeben!  —  Gebet  und  Klagen \r\nwechselten  ab,  und  der  Zustand  wuchs  um  so  schauerlicher, \r\nda  nun  oben  auf  den  Felsen  die  Ziegenhirten,  deren  Feuer \r\nman  schon  längst  gesehen  hatte,  hohl  aufschrien,  da  unten \r\nstrande  das  Schiff\"!  Sie  riefen  einander  noch  viel  unver- \r\nständliche Töne  zu,  in  welchen  einige,  mit  der  Sprache \r\nbekannt,  zu  vernehmen  glaubten,  als  freuten  sie  sich  auf \r\n\r\n\r\nSIZILIEN  1787  337 \r\n\r\nmanche  Beute,  die  sie  am  andern  Morgen  aufzufischen \r\ngedächten.  Sogar  der  tröstliche  Zweifel,  ob  denn  auch \r\nwirklich  das  Schift\"  dem  Felsen  sich  so  drohend  nähere, \r\nwar  leider  nur  zu  bald  gehoben,  indem  die  Mannschaft \r\nzu  großen  Stangen  griff,  um  das  Fahrzeug,  wenn  es  zum \r\nÄußersten  käme,  damit  von  den  Felsen  abzuhalten,  bis \r\ndenn  endlich  auch  diese  brächen  und  alles  verloren  sei. \r\nImmer  stärker  schwankte  das  Schiß\",  die  Brandung  schien \r\nsich  zu  vermehren,  und  meine  durch  alles  dieses  wieder- \r\nkehrende Seekrankheit  drängte  mir  den  Entschluß  auf, \r\nhinunter  in  die  Kajüte  zu  steigen.  Ich  legte  mich  halb \r\nbetäubt  auf  meine  Matratze,  doch  aber  mit  einer  gewissen \r\nangenehmen  Empfindung,  die  sich  vom  See  Tiberias  her- \r\nzuschreiben schien:  denn  ganz  deutlich  schwebte  mir  das \r\nBild  aus  Merlans  Kupferbibel  vor  Augen.  Und  so  be- \r\nwährt sich  die  Kraft  aller  sinnlich-sittlichen  Eindrücke \r\njedesmal  am  stärksten,  wenn  der  Mensch  ganz  auf  sich \r\nselbst  zurückgewiesen  ist.  Wie  lange  ich  so  in  halbem \r\nSchlafe  gelegen,  wüßte  ich  nicht  zu  sagen;  aufgeweckt \r\naber  ward  ich  durch  ein  gewaltsames  Getöse  über  mir: \r\nich  konnte  deutlich  vernehmen,  daß  es  die  großen  Seile \r\nwaren,  die  man  auf  dem  Verdeck  hin  und  wider  schleppte; \r\ndies  gab  mir  Hoffnung,  daß  man  von  den  Segeln  Ge- \r\nbrauch mache.  Nach  einer  kleinen  Weile  sprang  Kniep \r\nherunter  und  kündigte  mir  an,  daß  man  gerettet  sei:  der \r\ngelindeste  Windeshauch  habe  sich  erhoben;  in  dem  Augen- \r\nblick sei  man  bemüht  gewesen,  die  Segel  aufzuziehen,  er \r\nselbst  habe  nicht  versäumt,  Hand  anzulegen.  Man  ent- \r\nferne sich  schon  sichtbar  vom  Felsen,  und  obgleich  noch \r\nnicht  völlig  außer  der  Strömung,  hoffe  man  nun  doch,  sie \r\nzu  überwinden.  Oben  war  alles  stille;  sodann  kamen \r\nmehrere  der  Passagiere,  verkündigten  den  glücklichen \r\nAusgang  und  legten  sich  nieder. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  früh  am  vierten  Tage  unserer  Fahrt  erwachte, \r\nbefand  ich  mich  frisch  und  gesund,  so  wie  ich  auch  bei \r\nder  Überfahrt  zu  eben  dieser  Epoche  gewesen  war;  so \r\ndaß  ich  also  auf  einer  längern  Seereise  wahrscheinlich \r\nmit  einer  dreitägigen  Unpäßlichkeit  meinen  Tribut  würde \r\nbezahlt  haben, \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  22 \r\n\r\n\r\n338  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  11 \r\n\r\nVom  Verdeck  sah  ich  mit  Vergnügen  die  Insel  Capri  in \r\nziemlicher  Entfernung  zur  Seite  liegen  und  unser  Schifif \r\nin  solcher  Richtung,  daß  wir  hoffen  konnten,  in  den  Golf \r\nhineinzufahren;  welches  denn  auch  bald  geschah.  Nun \r\nhatten  wir  die  Freude,  nach  einer  ausgestandenen  harten \r\nNacht  dieselben  Gegenstände,  die  uns  abends  vorher  ent- \r\nzückt hatten,  in  entgegengesetztem  Lichte  zu  bewundern. \r\nBald  ließen  wir  jene  gefährliche  Felseninsel  hinter  uns. \r\nHatten  wir  gestern  die  rechte  Seite  des  Golfs  von  weitem \r\nbewundert,  so  erschienen  nun  auch  die  Kastelle  und  die \r\nStadt  gerade  vor  uns,  sodann  links  der  Posilip  und  die \r\nErdzungen,  die  sich  bis  gegen  Procida  und  Ischia  er- \r\nstrecken. Alles  war  auf  dem  Verdeck,  voran  ein  für  seinen \r\nOrient  sehr  eingenommener  griechischer  Priester,  der  den \r\nLandesbewohnern,  die  ihr  herrliches  Vaterland  mit  Ent- \r\nzücken begrüßten,  auf  ihre  Frage,  wie  sich  denn 'Neapel \r\nzu  Konstantinopel  verhalte,  sehr  pathetisch  antwortete: \r\nAnche  (juesta  e  una  cittä!  Auch  dieses  ist  eine  Stadt! \r\nWir  langten  zur  rechten  Zeit  im  Hafen  an,  umsummt  von \r\nMenschen;  es  war  der  lebhafteste  Augenblick  des  Tages. \r\nKaum  waren  unsere  Koffer  und  sonstigen  Gerätschaften \r\nausgeladen  und  standen  am  Ufer,  als  gleich  zwei  Last- \r\nträger sich  derselben  bemächtigten;  und  kaum  hatten  wir \r\nausgesprochen,  daß  wir  bei  Moriconi  logieren  würden, \r\nso  liefen  sie  mit  dieser  Last  wie  mit  einer  Beute  davon, \r\nso  daß  wir  ihnen  durch  die  menschenreichen  Straßen  und \r\nüber  den  bewegten  Platz  nicht  mit  den  Augen  folgen \r\nkonnten.  Kniep  hatte  das  Portefeuille  unter  dem  Arm, \r\nund  wir  hätten  wenigstens  die  Zeichnungen  gerettet,  wenn \r\njene  Träger,  weniger  ehrlich  als  die  neapolitanischen \r\narmen  Teufel,  uns  um  dasjenige  gebracht  hätten,  was  die \r\nBranduncf  verschont  hatte. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  339 \r\n\r\nNEAPEL \r\nAn  Herder \r\n\r\nNeapel,  den  ly.  Mai  i'jSy. \r\n\r\nHIER  bin  ich  wieder,  meine  Lieben,  frisch  und  gesund. \r\nIch  habe  die  Reise  durch  SiziHen  leicht  und  schnell \r\ngetrieben;  wenn  ich  wiederkomme,  sollt  ihr  beurteilen,  tine \r\nich  gesehen  habe.  Daß  ich  sonst  so  an  den  Gegenständen \r\nklebte  und  haftete,  hat  mir  nun  eine  unglaubliche  Fertig- \r\nkeit verschafft,  alles  gleichsam  vom  Blatt  wegzuspielen, \r\nund  ich  finde  mich  recht  glücklich,  den  großen,  schönen, \r\nunvergleichbaren  Gedanken  von  Sizilien  so  klar,  ganz \r\nund  lauter  in  der  Seele  zu  haben.  Nun  bleibt  meiner \r\nSehnsucht  kein  Gegenstand  mehr  im  Mittag,  da  ich  auch \r\ngestern  von  Pästum  zurückgekommen  bin.  Das  Meer \r\nund  die  Inseln  haben  mir  Genuß  und  Leiden  gegeben, \r\nund  ich  kehre  befriedigt  zurück.  Laßt  mich  jedes  Detail \r\nbis  zu  meiner  Wiederkehr  aufsparen!  Auch  ist  hier  in \r\nNeapel  kein  Besinnens;  diesen  Ort  werde  ich  euch  nun \r\nbesser  schildern,  als  es  meine  ersten  Briefe  taten.  Den \r\nersten  Juni  reise  ich  nach  Rom,  wenn  mich  nicht  eine \r\nhöhere  Macht  hindert,  und  anfangs  Juli  denke  ich  von  dort \r\nwieder  abzugehen.  Ich  muß  euch  so  bald  als  möglich \r\nwiedersehen,  es  sollen  gute  Tage  werden.  Ich  habe  un- \r\nsäglich aufgeladen  und  brauche  Ruhe,  es  wieder  zu  ver- \r\narbeiten. \r\n\r\nFür  alles,  was  du  Liebes  und  Gutes  an  meinen  Schriften \r\ntust,  danke  ich  dir  tausendmal;  ich  wünschte  immer  etwas \r\nBesseres  auch  dir  zur  Freude  zu  machen.  Was  mir  auch \r\nvon  dir  begegnen  wird  und  wo,  soll  mir  willkommen  sein: \r\nwir  sind  so  nah  in  unsern  Vorstellungsarten,  als  es  mög- \r\nlich ist,  ohne  eins  zu  sein,  und  in  den  Hauptpunkten  am \r\nnächsten.  Wenn  du  diese  Zeit  her  viel  aus  dir  selbst  ge- \r\nschöpft hast,  so  hab  ich  viel  erworben,  und  ich  kann  einen \r\nguten  Tausch  hoffen. \r\n\r\nIch  bin  freilich,  wie  du  sagst,  mit  meiner  Vorstellung  sehr \r\nans  Gegenwärtige  geheftet,  und  je  mehr  ich  die  Welt \r\nsehe,  desto  weniger  kann  ich  hoften,  daß  die  Menschheit \r\n\r\n\r\n340  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  H \r\n\r\nje  eine  weise,  kluge,  glückliche  Masse  werden  könne. \r\nVielleicht  ist  unter  den  Millionen  Welten  eine,  die  sich \r\ndieses  Vorzugs  rühmen  kann;  bei  der  Konstitution  der \r\nunsrigen  bleibt  mir  so  wenig  für  sie  als  für  Sizilien  bei \r\nder  seinigen  zu  hoffen. \r\n\r\nIn  einem  beiliegenden  Blatte  sag  ich  etwas  über  den  Weg \r\nnach  Salem  und  über  Pästum  selbst;  es  ist  die  letzte  und \r\nfast  möcht  ich  sagen  herrlichste  Idee,  die  ich  nun  nord- \r\nwärts vollständig  mitnehme.  Auch  ist  der  mittlere  Tempel \r\nnach  meiner  Meinung  allem  vorzuziehen,  was  man  noch \r\nin  Sizilien  sieht. \r\n\r\nWas  den  Homer  betrifft,  ist  mir  wie  eine  Decke  von  den \r\nAugen  gefallen.  Die  Beschreibungen,  die  Gleichnisse  usw. \r\nkommen  uns  poetisch  vor  und  sind  doch  unsäglich  natür- \r\nlich, aber  freilich  mit  einer  Reinheit  und  Innigkeit  ge- \r\nzeichnet, vor  der  man  erschrickt.  Selbst  die  sonderbarsten \r\nerlogenen  Begebenheiten  haben  eine  Natürlichkeit,  die \r\nich  nie  so  gefühlt  habe  als  in  der  Nähe  der  beschriebenen \r\nGegenstände.  Laß  mich  meinen  Gedanken  kurz  so  aus- \r\ndrücken: sie  stellten  die  Existenz  dar,  7vir  gewöhnlich \r\nden  Efifekt;  sie  schilderten  das  Fürchterliche,  7vir  schildern \r\nfürchterhch;  5?V  das  Angenehme,  7f'/r  angenehm  usw.  Daher \r\nkommt  alles  Übertriebene,  alles  Manierierte,  alle  falsche \r\nGrazie,  aller  Schwulst.  Denn  wenn  man  den  Eftekt  und \r\nauf  den  Effekt  arbeitet,  so  glaubt  man  ihn  nicht  fühlbar \r\ngenug  machen  zu  können.  Wenn,  was  ich  sage,  nicht \r\nneu  ist,  so  hab  ich  es  doch  bei  neuem  Anlaß  recht  leb- \r\nhaft gefühlt.  Nun  ich  alle  diese  Küsten  und  Vorgebirge, \r\nGolfe  und  Buchten,  Inseln  und  Erdzungen,  Felsen  und \r\nSandstreifen,  buschige  Hügel,  sanfte  Weiden,  fruchtbare \r\nFelder,  geschmückte  Gärten,  gepflegte  Bäume,  hängende \r\nReben,  Wolkenberge  und  immer  heitere  Ebnen,  Klippen \r\nund  Bänke  und  das  alles  umgebende  Meer  mit  so  vielen \r\nAbwechselungen  und  Mannigfaltigkeiten  im  Geiste  gegen- \r\nwärtig habe,  nun  ist  mir  erst  die  Odyssee  ein  lebendiges \r\nWort. \r\n\r\nFerner  muß  ich  dir  vertrauen,  daß  ich  dem  Geheimnis \r\nder  Pflanzenzeugung  und   -Organisation   ganz  nahe   bin \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  341 \r\n\r\nund  daß  es  das  Einfachste  ist,  was  nur  gedacht  werden \r\nkann.  Unter  diesem  Himmel  kann  man  die  schönsten \r\nBeobachtungen  machen.  Den  Hauptpunkt,  wo  der  Keim \r\nsteckt,  habe  ich  ganz  klar  und  zweifellos  gefunden;  alles \r\nübrige  seh  ich  auch  schon  im  ganzen,  und  nur  noch  einige \r\nPunkte  müssen  bestimmter  werden.  Die  Urpflanze  wird \r\ndas  wunderlichste  Geschöpf  von  der  Welt,  um  welches \r\nmich  die  Natur  selbst  beneiden  soll.  Mit  diesem  Modell \r\nund  dem  Schlüssel  dazu  kann  man  alsdann  noch  Pflanzen \r\nins  Unendliche  erfinden,  die  konsequent  sein  müssen, \r\ndas  heißt:  die,  wenn  sie  auch  nicht  existieren,  doch  exi- \r\nstieren könnten  und  nicht  etwa  malerische  oder  dichte- \r\nrische Schatten  und  Scheine  sind,  sondern  eine  innerliche \r\nWahrheit  und  Notwendigkeit  haben.  Dasselbe  Gesetz  wird \r\nsich  auf  alles  übrige  Lebendige  anwenden  lassen. \r\n\r\nDen  18.  Mai. \r\nTischbein,  der  nach  Rom  wieder  zurückgekehrt  ist,  hat, \r\nwie  wir  merken,  hier  in  der  Zwischenzeit  so  für  uns  ge- \r\narbeitet, daß  wir  seine  Abwesenheit  nicht  empfinden  sollen. \r\nEr  scheint  seinen  sämtlichen  hiesigen  Freunden  so  viel \r\nZutrauen  zu  uns  eingeflößt  zu  haben,  daß  sie  sich  alle \r\noffen,  freundlich  und  tätig  gegen  uns  erweisen,  welches \r\nich  besonders  in  meiner  gegenwärtigen  Lage  sehr  bedarf, \r\nweil  kein  Tag  vergeht,  wo  ich  nicht  jemand  um  irgend \r\neine  Gefälligkeit  und  Beistand  anzurufen  hätte.  Soeben \r\nbin  ich  im  Begriff,  ein  summarisches  Verzeichnis  aufzu- \r\nsetzen von  dem,  was  ich  noch  zu  sehen  wünschte;  da  denn \r\ndie  Kürze  der  Zeit  Meisterin  bleiben  und  andeuten  wird, \r\nwas  denn  auch  wirklich  nachgeholt  werden  könne. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  Mai. \r\nHeute  begegnete  mir  ein  angenehmes  Abenteuer,  welches \r\nmich  wohl  zu  einigem  Nachdenken  bewegen  konnte  und \r\ndes  Erzählens  wert  ist. \r\n\r\nEine  Dame,  die  mich  schon  bei  meinem  ersten  Aufenthalt \r\nvielfach  begünstigt,  ersuchte  mich,  abends  Punkt  fünf \r\nUhr  bei  ihr  einzutreffen:  es  wolle  mich  ein  Ensrländer \r\n\r\n\r\n342  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nsprechen,  der  mir  über  meinen  Werther  etwas  zu  sagen \r\nhabe. \r\n\r\nVor  einem  halben  Jahre  würde  hierauf,  und  wäre  sie  mir \r\ndoppelt  wert  gewesen,  gewiß  eine  abschlägliche  Antwort \r\nerfolgt  sein;  aber  daran,  daß  ich  zusagte,  konnte  ich  wohl \r\nmerken,  meine  sizilianische  Reise  habe  glücklich  auf  mich \r\ngewirkt,  und  ich  versprach,  zu  kommen. \r\nLeider  aber  ist  die  Stadt  zu  groß  und  der  Gegenstände \r\nso  viel,  daß  ich  eine  Viertelstunde  zu  spät  die  Treppe \r\nhinaufstieg  und  eben  an  der  verschlossenen  Türe  auf  der \r\nSchilfmatte  stand,  um  zu  klingeln,  als  die  Türe  schon  auf- \r\nging und  ein  schöner  Mann  in  mittlem  Jahren  heraustrat, \r\nden  ich  sogleich  für  den  Engländer  erkannte.  Er  hatte \r\nmich  kaum  angesehen,  als  er  sagte:  Sie  sind  der  Verfasser \r\ndes  Werther! — Ich  bekannte  mich  dazu  und  entschuldigte \r\nmich,  nicht  früher  gekommen  zu  sein. \r\nIch  konnte  nicht  einen  Augenblick  länger  warten,  ver- \r\nsetzte derselbe:  was  ich  Ihnen  zu  sagen  habe,  ist  ganz \r\nkurz  und  kann  ebensogut  hier  auf  der  Schilfmatte  ge- \r\nschehen. Ich  will  nicht  wiederholen,  was  Sie  von  Tau- \r\nsenden gehört;  auch  hat  das  Werk  nicht  so  heftig  auf \r\nmich  gewirkt  als  auf  andere;  so  oft  ich  aber  daran  denke, \r\nwas  darzu  gehörte,  um  es  zu  schreiben,  so  muß  ich  mich \r\nimmer  aufs  neue  verwundern. \r\n\r\nIch  wollte  irgend  etwas  dankbar  dagegen  erwidern,  als \r\ner  mir  ins  Wort  fiel  und  ausrief:  Ich  darf  keinen  Augen- \r\nblick länger  säumen,  mein  Verlangen  ist  erfüllt,  Ihnen \r\ndies  selbst  gesagt  zu  haben.  Leben  Sie  recht  wohl  und \r\nglücklich!  —  Und  so  fuhr  er  die  Treppe  hinunter.  Ich \r\nstand  einige  Zeit  über  diesen  ehrenvollen  Text  nach- \r\ndenkend und  klingelte  endlich.  Die  Dame  vernahm  mit \r\nVergnügen  unser  Zusammentreffen  und  erzählte  manches \r\nVorteilhafte  von  diesem  seltenen  und  seltsamen  Manne. \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  25.  Mai. \r\nMein  lockeres  Prinzeßchen  werde  ich  wohl  nicht  wieder- \r\nsehen; sie  ist  wirklich  nach  Sorrent  und  hat  mir  die  Ehre \r\nangetan,  vor  ihrer  Abreise  auf  mich  zu  schelten,  daß  ich \r\ndas  steinige  und  wüste  Sizilien  ihr  habe  vorziehen  können . \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  343 \r\n\r\nEinige  Freunde  gaben  mir  Auskunft  über  diese  sonder- \r\nbare Erscheinung.  Aus  einem  guten,  doch  unvermögen- \r\nden Hause  geboren,  im  Kloster  erzogen,  entschloß  sie \r\nsich,  einen  alten  und  reichen  Fürsten  zu  heiraten,  und \r\nman  konnte  sie  um  so  eher  dazu  überreden,  als  die  Natur \r\nsie  zu  einem  zwar  guten,  aber  zur  Liebe  völlig  unfähigen \r\nWesen  gebildet  hatte.  In  dieser  reichen,  aber  durch \r\nFamilienverhältnisse  höchst  beschränkten  Lage  suchte \r\nsie  sich  durch  ihren  Geist  zu  helfen  und,  da  sie  in  Tun \r\nund  Lassen  gehindert  Avar,  wenigstens  ihrem  Mundwerk \r\nfreies  Spiel  zu  geben.  Man  versicherte  mir,  daß  ihr  eigent- \r\nlichster Wandel  ganz  untadelig  sei,  daß  sie  sich  aber  fest \r\nvorgesetzt  zu  haben  scheine,  durch  ein  unbändiges  Reden \r\nallen  Verhältnissen  ins  Angesicht  zu  schlagen.  I\\Ian  be- \r\nmerkte scherzend,  daß  keine  Zensur  ihre  Diskurse,  wären \r\nsie  schriftlich  verfaßt,  könne  durchgehen  lassen,  weil  sie \r\ndurchaus  nichts  vorbringe,  als  was  Religion,  Staat  oder \r\nSitten  verletze. \r\n\r\nMan  erzählte  die  wunderlichsten  und  artigsten  Geschichten \r\nvon  ihr,  wovon  eine  hier  stehen  mag,  ob  sie  gleich  nicht \r\ndie  anständigste  ist. \r\n\r\nKurz  vor  dem  Erdbeben,  das  Kalabrien  betraf,  war  sie \r\nauf  die  dortigen  Güter  ihres  Gemahls  gezogen.  Auch  in \r\nder  Nähe  ihres  Schlosses  war  eine  Baracke  gebaut,  das \r\nheißt  ein  hölzernes,  einstöckiges  Haus,  unmittelbar  auf \r\nden  Boden  aufgesetzt,  übrigens  tapeziert,  möbliert  und \r\nschicklich  eingerichtet.  Bei  den  ersten  Anzeigen  des \r\nErdbebens  flüchtete  sie  dahin.  Sie  saß  auf  dem  Sofa, \r\nKnötchen  knüpfend,  vor  sich  ein  Nähtischchen,  gegen  ihr \r\nüber  ein  Abbe,  ein  alter  Hausgeistlicher.  Auf  einmal \r\nwogte  der  Boden,  das  Gebäude  sank  an  ihrer  Seite  nieder, \r\nindem  die  entgegengesetzte  sich  emporhob;  der  Abbe \r\nund  das  Tischchen  wurde  also  auch  in  die  Höhe  gehoben. \r\nPfui!  rief  sie,  an  der  sinkenden  Wand  mit  dem  Kopfe  ge- \r\nlehnt: schickt  sich  das  für  einen  so  ehrwürdigen  Mann? \r\nIhr  gebärdet  Euch  ja,  als  wenn  Ihr  auf  mich  fallen  wolltet. \r\nDas  ist  ganz  gegen  alle  Sitte  und  Wohlstand! \r\nIndessen  hatte  das  Haus  sich  wieder  niedergesetzt,  und \r\nsie  wußte  sich  vor  Lachen  nicht  zu  lassen  über  die  när- \r\n\r\n\r\n344  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nrische,  lüsterne  Figur,  die  der  gute  Alte  sollte  gespielt \r\nhaben,  und  sie  schien  über  diesen  Scherz  von  allen  Kala- \r\nmitäten, ja  dem  großen  Verlust,  der  ihre  Familie  und \r\nso  viel  tausend  Menschen  betraf,  nicht  das  mindeste  zu \r\nempfinden.  Ein  wundersam  glücklicher  Charakter,  dem \r\nnoch  eine  Posse  gelingt,  indem  ihn  die  Erde  verschlin- \r\ngen will. \r\n\r\nSoft  Habend  den  26.  Mai. \r\nGenau  betrachtet,  möchte  man  doch  wohl  gut  heißen, \r\ndaß  es  so  viele  Heilige  gibt:  nun  kann  jeder  Gläubige \r\nden  seinigen  auslesen  und  mit  vollem  Vertrauen  sich  ge- \r\nrade an  den  wenden,  der  ihm  eigentlich  zusagt.  Heute \r\nwar  der  Tag  des  meinigen,  den  ich  denn,  ihm  zu  Ehren, \r\nnach  seiner  Weise  und  Lehre  andächtig-munter  beging. \r\nPhilippus  Neri  steht  in  hohem  Ansehn  und  zugleich  hei- \r\nterm  Andenken;  man  wird  erbaut  und  erfreut,  wenn  man \r\nvon  ihm  und  seiner  hohen  Gottesfurcht  vernimmt;  zu- \r\ngleich aber  hört  man  auch  von  seiner  guten  Laune  sehr \r\nviel  erzählen.  Seit  seinen  ersten  Jugendjahren  fühlte  er \r\ndie  brünstigsten  Religionstriebe,  und  im  Laufe  seines \r\nLebens  entwickelten  sich  in  ihm  die  höchsten  Gaben  des \r\nreligiösen  Enthusiasmus:  die  Gabe  des  unwillkürlichen \r\nGebets,  der  tiefen  wortlosen  Anbetung,  die  Gabe  der \r\nTränen,  der  Ekstase  und  zuletzt  sogar  des  Aufsteigens \r\nvom  Boden  und  Schwebens  über  demselben,  welches  vor \r\nallen  für  das  Höchste  gehalten  wird. \r\nZu  so  vielen  geheimnisvollen,  seltsamen  Innerlichkeiten \r\ngesellte  er  den  klarsten  Menschenverstand,  die  reinste \r\nWürdigung  oder  vielmehr  Abwürdigung  der  irdischen \r\nDinge,  den  tätigsten  Beistand,  in  leiblicher  und  geist- \r\nlicher Not,  seinem  Nebenmenschen  gewidmet.  Streng \r\nbeobachtete  er  alle  Obliegenheiten,  wie  sie  auch  an  Festen, \r\nKirchenbesuchen,  Beten,  Fasten  und  sonst  von  dem \r\ngläubigen,  kirchlichen  Manne  gefordert  werden.  Ebenso \r\nbeschäftigte  er  sich  mit  Bildung  der  Jugend,  mit  musika- \r\nlischer und  rednerischer  Übung  derselben,  indem  er  nicht \r\nallein  geistliche,  sondern  auch  geistreiche  Themata  vor- \r\nlegte und  sonst  aufregende  Gespräche  und  Disputationen \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  345 \r\n\r\nveranlaßte.  Hiebei  möchte  denn  wohl  das  Sonderbarste \r\nscheinen,  daß  er  das  alles  aus  eignem  Trieb  und  Befugnis \r\ntat  und  leistete,  seinen  Weg  viele  Jahre  stetig  verfolgte, \r\nohne  zu  irgend  einem  Orden  oder  Kongregation  zu  ge- \r\nhören, ja  ohne  die  geistliche  Weihe  zu  haben. \r\nDoch  bedeutender  muß  es  auffallen,  daß  gerade  dies  zu \r\nLuthers  Zeit  geschah  und  daß  mitten  in  Rom  ein  tüch- \r\ntiger, gottesfürchtiger,  energischer,  tätiger  Mann  gleich- \r\nfalls den  Gedanken  hatte,  das  Geistliche,  ja  das  Heilige \r\nmit  dein  Weltlichen  zu  verbinden,  das  Himmlische  in  das \r\nSäkulum  einzuführen  und  dadurch  ebenfalls  eine  Refor- \r\nmation vorzubereiten.  Denn  hier  liegt  doch  ganz  allein \r\nder  Schlüssel,  der  die  Gefängnisse  des  Papsttums  öffnen \r\nund  der  freien  Welt  ihren  Gott  wiedergeben  soll. \r\nDer  päpstliche  Hof  jedoch,  der  einen  so  bedeutenden \r\nMann  in  der  Nähe,  im  Bezirk  von  Rom,  unter  seinem \r\nGewahrsam  hatte,  ließ  nicht  nach,  bis  dieser,  der  ohne- \r\nhin ein  geistliches  Leben  führte,  schon  seine  Wohnung  in \r\nKlöstern  nahm,  daselbst  lehrte,  ermunterte,  ja  sogar  wo \r\nnicht  einen  Orden,  doch  eine  freie  Versammlung  zu  stif- \r\nten im  Begriff  war,  endlich  beredet  ward,  die  Weihe  zu \r\nnehmen  und  alle  die  Vorteile  damit  zu  empfangen,  die \r\nihm  denn  doch  bisher  auf  seinem  Lebenswege  ermangelt \r\nhatten. \r\n\r\nWill  man  auch  seine  körperliche  wunderbare  Erhebung \r\nüber  den  Boden,  wie  billig,  in  Zweifel  ziehen,  so  war  er \r\ndoch  dem  Geiste  nach  hoch  über  dieser  Welt  erhoben \r\nund  deswegen  ihm  nichts  so  sehr  zuwider  als  Eitelkeit, \r\nSchein,  Anmaßung,  gegen  die  er  auch  immer,  als  gegen \r\ndie  größten  Hindernisse  eines  wahren  gottseligen  Lebens, \r\nkräftig  wirkte,  und  zwar,  wie  uns  manche  Geschichte \r\nüberliefert,  immer  mit  gutem  Humor. \r\nEr  befindet  sich  zum  Beispiel  eben  in  der  Nähe  des \r\nPapstes,  als  diesem  berichtet  wird,  daß  in  der  Nähe  von \r\nRom  eine  Klosterfrau  mit  allerlei  wunderlichen  geist- \r\nlichen Gaben  sich  hervortue.  Die  Wahrhaftigkeit  dieser \r\nErzählungen  zu  untersuchen,  erhält  Neri  den  Auftrag.  Er \r\nsetzt  sich  sogleich  zu  Maultier  und  ist  bei  sehr  bösem \r\nWetter  und  Weg  bald  im  Kloster.     Eingeführt  unterhält \r\n\r\n\r\n346  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\ner  sich  mit  der  Äbtissin,  die  ihm  von  allen  diesen  Gna- \r\ndenzeichen mit  vollkommener  Beistimmung  genauste \r\nKenntnis  gibt.  Die  geforderte  Nonne  tritt  ein,  und  er, \r\nohne  sie  weiter  zu  begrüßen,  reicht  ihr  den  kotigen  Stiefel \r\nhin,  mit  dem  Ansinnen,  daß  sie  ihn  ausziehen  solle.  Die \r\nheilige,  reinliche  Jungfrau  tritt  erschrocken  zurück  und \r\ngibt  ihre  Entrüstung  über  dieses  Zumuten  mit  heftigen \r\nWorten  zu  erkennen.  Neri  erhebt  sich  ganz  gelassen, \r\nbesteigt  sein  Maultier  und  findet  sich  wieder  vor  dem \r\nPapst,  ehe  dieser  es  nur  vermuten  konnte;  denn  wegen \r\nPrüfung  solcher  Geistesgaben  sind  katholischen  Beicht- \r\nvätern bedeutende  Vorsichtsmaßregeln  aufs  genauste  vor- \r\ngeschrieben, weil  die  Kirche  zwar  die  Möglichkeit  solcher \r\nhimmlischen  Begünstigungen  zugibt,  aber  die  Wirklich- \r\nkeit derselben  nicht  ohne  die  genauste  Prüfung  zugesteht. \r\nDem  verwunderten  Papste  eröfihete  Neri  kürzlich  das \r\nResultat.  Sie  ist  keine  Heilige,  ruft  er  aus,  sie  tut \r\nkeine  Wunder!  denn  die  Haupteigenschaft  fehlt  ihr,  die \r\nDemut. \r\n\r\nDiese  Maxime  kann  man  als  leitendes  Prinzip  seines \r\nganzen  Lebens  ansehen;  denn,  um  nur  noch  eins  zu  er- \r\nzählen, als  er  die  Kongregation  der  Padri  dell'  Oratorio \r\ngestiftet  hatte,  die  sich  bald  ein  großes  Ansehen  erwarb \r\nund  gar  vielen  den  Wunsch  einflößte,  Mitglied  derselben \r\nzu  werden,  kam  ein  junger  römischer  Prinz,  um  Aufnahme \r\nbittend,  welchem  denn  auch  das  Noviziat  und  die  dem- \r\nselben angewiesene  Kleidung  zugestanden  wurde.  Da \r\naber  selbiger  nach  einiger  Zeit  um  wirklichen  Eintritt \r\nnachsuchte,  hieß  es,  daß  vorher  noch  einige  Prüfungen \r\nzu  bestehen  seien,  wozu  er  sich  denn  auch  bereit  erklärte. \r\nDa  brachte  Neri  einen  langen  Fuchsschwanz  hervor  und \r\nforderte,  der  Prinz  solle  diesen  sich  hinten  an  das  lange \r\nRöckchen  anheften  lassen  und  ganz  ernsthaft  durch  alle \r\nStraßen  von  Rom  gehen.  Der  junge  Mann  entsetzte  sich, \r\nwie  oben  die  Nonne,  und  äußerte:  er  habe  sich  gemeldet, \r\nnicht  um  Schande,  sondern  um  Ehre  zu  erlangen.  Dameinte \r\ndenn  Vater  Neri,  dies  sei  von  ihrem  Kreise  nicht  zu  erwar- \r\nten, wo  die  höchste  Entsagung  das  erste  Gesetz  bleibe. \r\nWorauf  denn  der  Jüngling  seinen  Abschied  nahm. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  347 \r\n\r\nIn  einem  kurzen  Wahlspruch  hatte  Neri  seine  Haupt- \r\nlehre verfaßt:  Spernere  mundum,  spernere  te  ipsum, \r\nspernere  te  sperni.  Und  damit  war  freilich  alles  gesagt. \r\nDie  beiden  ersten  Punkte  bildet  sich  ein  Hypochondrist \r\nwohl  manchmal  ein  erfüllen  zu  können;  um  aber  sich \r\nzum  dritten  zu  bequemen,  müßte  man  auf  dem  Wege \r\nsein^  ein  Heiliger  zu  werden. \r\n\r\n\r\nDe7i  27,  Mai. \r\nDie  sämtlichen  lieben  Briefe  vom  Ende  des  vorigen  Mo- \r\nnats habe  ich  gestern  alle  auf  einmal  von  Rom  her  durch \r\nGraf  Frieß  erhalten  und  mir  mit  Lesen  und  Wiederlesen \r\netwas  Rechts  zugute  getan.  Das  sehnlich  erwartete  Schäch- \r\ntelchen war  auch  dabei,  und  ich  danke  tausendmal  für \r\nalles. \r\n\r\nNun  wird  es  aber  bald  Zeit,  daß  ich  von  hier  flüchte; \r\ndenn  indem  ich  mir  Neapel  und  seine  Umgebungen  noch \r\nrecht  zu  guter  Letzt  vergegenwärtigen,  den  Eindruck  er- \r\nneuern und  über  manches  abschließen  möchte,  so  reißt \r\nder  Strom  des  Tages  mich  fort,  und  nun  schließen  auch \r\nvorzügliche  Menschen  sich  an,  die  ich  als  alte  und  neue \r\nBekannte  ohnmöglich  so  geradezu  abweisen  kann.  Ich \r\nfand  eine  liebenswürdige  Dame,  mit  der  ich  vorigen \r\nSommer  in  Karlsbad  die  angenehmsten  Tage  verlebt \r\nhatte.  Um  wie  manche  Stunde  betrogen  wir  die  Gegen- \r\nwart in  heiterster  Erinnerung.  Alle  die  Lieben  und  Wer- \r\nten kamen  wieder  an  die  Reihe,  vor  allem  der  heitere \r\nHumor  unseres  teuren  Fürsten.  Sie  besaß  das  Gedicht \r\nnoch,  womit  ihn  bei  seinem  Wegritt  die  Mädchen  von \r\nEngelhaus  überraschten.  Es  rief  die  lustigen  Szenen  alle \r\nzurück,  die  witzigen  Neckereien  und  Mystifikationen,  die \r\ngeistreichen  Versuche,  das  Vergeltungsrecht  aneinander \r\nauszuüben.  Schnell  fühlten  wir  uns  auf  deutschem  Bo- \r\nden, in  der  besten  deutschen  Gesellschaft,  eingeschränkt \r\nvon  Felswänden,  durch  ein  seltsames  Lokal  zusammen- \r\ngehalten, mehr  noch  durch  Hochachtung,  Freundschaft \r\nund  Neigung  vereinigt.  Sobald  wir  jedoch  ans  Fenster \r\ntraten,  rauschte  der  neapolitanische  Strom  wieder  so  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\n34»  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwaltsam  an  uns  vorbei,  daß  jene  friedlichen  Erinnerungen \r\nnicht  festzuhalten  waren. \r\n\r\nDer  Bekanntschaft  des  Herzogs  und  der  Herzogin  von \r\nUrsel  könnt  ich  ebensowenig  ausweichen.  Treffliche \r\nPersonen  von  hohen  Sitten,  reinem  Natur-  und  Menschen- \r\nsinn, entschiedener  Kunstliebe,  Wohlwollen  für  Begeg- \r\nnende. Eine  fortgesetzte  und  wiederholte  Unterhaltung \r\nwar  höchst  anziehend. \r\n\r\nHamilton  und  seine  Schöne  setzten  gegen  mich  ihre \r\nFreundlichkeit  fort.  Ich  sjjeiste  bei  ihnen,  und  gegen \r\nAbend  produzierte  Miß  Harte  auch  ihre  musikalischen \r\nund  melischen  Talente. \r\n\r\nAuf  Antrieb  Freund  Hackerts,  der  sein  Wohlwollen  gegen \r\nmich  steigert  und  mir  alles  Merkwürdige  zur  Kenntnis \r\nbringen  möchte,  führte  uns  Hamilton  in  sein  geheimes \r\nKunst-  und  Gerümpelgewölbe.  Da  sieht  es  denn  ganz \r\nverwirrt  aus,  die  Produkte  aller  Epochen  zufällig  durch- \r\neinander gestellt:  Büsten,  Torse,  Vasen,  Bronze,  von  sizi- \r\nlianischen  Achaten  allerlei  Hauszierat,  sogar  ein  Kapell- \r\nchen, Geschnitztes,  Gemaltes,  und  was  er  nur  zufällig \r\nzusammenkaufte.  In  einem  langen  Kasten  an  der  Erde, \r\ndessen  aufgebrochenen  Deckel  ich  neugierig  beiseite \r\nschob,  lagen  zwei  ganz  herrliche  Kandelaber  von  Bronze. \r\nMit  einem  Wink  machte  ich  Hackerten  aufmerksam  und \r\nlispelte  ihm  die  Frage  zu,  ob  diese  nicht  ganz  denen  in \r\nPortici  ähnlich  seien.  Er  winkte  mir  dagegen  Stillschwei- \r\ngen; sie  mochten  sich  freilich  aus  den  pompejischen \r\nGrüften  seitwärts  hieher  verloren  haben.  Wegen  solcher \r\nund  ähnlicher  glücklichen  Erwerbnisse  mag  der  Ritter \r\ndiese  verborgenen  Schätze  nur  wohl  seinen  vertrautesten \r\nFreunden  sehen  lassen. \r\n\r\nAuffallend  war  mir  ein  aufrechtstehender,  an  der  Vorder- \r\nseite offener,  inwendig  schwarz  angestrichener  Kasten, \r\nvon  dem  prächtigsten  goldenen  Rahmen  eingefaßt.  Der \r\nRaum  groß  genug,  um  eine  stehende  menschliche  Figur \r\naufzunehmen,  und  demgemäß  erfuhren  wir  auch  die  Ab- \r\nsicht. Der  Kunst-  und  Mädchenfreund,  nicht  zufrieden, \r\ndas  schöne  Gebild  als  bewegliche  Statue  zu  sehen,  wollte \r\nsich  auch  an  ihr  als  an  einem  bunten,  unnachahmbaren \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  349 \r\n\r\nGemälde  ergötzen,  und  so  hatte  sie  manchmal  innerhalb \r\ndieses  goldnen  Rahmens,  auf  schwarzem  Grund  vielfarbig \r\ngekleidet,  die  antiken  Gemälde  von  Pompeji  und  selbst \r\nneuere  Meisterwerke  nachgeahmt.  Diese  Epoche  schien \r\nvorüber  zu  sein,  auch  war  der  Apparat  schwer  zu  trans- \r\nportieren und  ins  rechte  Licht  zu  setzen;  uns  konnte  also \r\nein  solches  Schauspiel  nicht  zuteil  werden. \r\nHier  ist  der  Ort,  noch  einer  andern  entschiedenen  Lieb- \r\nhaberei der  Neapolitaner  überhaupt  zu  gedenken.  Es \r\nsind  die  Krippchen  (presepe),  die  man  zu  Weihnachten \r\nin  allen  Kirchen  sieht,  eigentlich  die  Anbetung  der  Hir- \r\nten, Engel  und  Könige  vorstellend,  mehr  oder  weniger \r\nvollständig,  reich  und  kostbar  zusammengruppiert.  Diese \r\nDarstellung  ist  in  dem  heitern  Neapel  bis  auf  die  flachen \r\nHausdächer  gestiegen;  dort  wird  ein  leichtes,  hütten- \r\nartiges Gerüst  erbaut,  mit  immergrünen  Bäumen  und \r\nSträuchen  aufgeschmückt.  Die  Mutter  Gottes,  das  Kind \r\nund  die  sämtlichen  Umstehenden  und  Umschwebenden, \r\nkostbar  ausgeputzt,  auf  welche  Garderobe  das  Haus  große \r\nSummen  verwendet.  Was  aber  das  Ganze  unnachahmlich \r\nverherrlicht,  ist  der  Hintergrund,  welcher  den  Vesuv  mit \r\nseinen  Umgebungen  einfaßt. \r\n\r\nDa  mag  man  nun  manchmal  auch  lebendige  Figuren \r\nzwischen  die  Puppen  mit  eingemischt  haben,  und  nach \r\nund  nach  ist  eine  der  bedeutendsten  Unterhaltungen \r\nhoher  und  reicher  Familien  geworden,  zu  ihrer  Abend- \r\nergötzung  auch  weltliche  Bilder,  sie  mögen  nun  der  Ge- \r\nschichte oder  der  Dichtkunst  angehören,  in  ihren  Palästen \r\naufzuführen. \r\n\r\nDarf  ich  mir  eine  Bemerkung  erlauben,  die  freilich  ein \r\nwohlbehandelter  Gast  nicht  wagen  sollte,  so  muß  ich  ge- \r\nstehen, daß  mir  unsere  schöne  Unterhaltende  doch  eigent- \r\nlich als  ein  geistloses  Wesen  vorkommt,  die  wohl  mit \r\nihrer  Gestalt  bezahlen,  aber  durch  keinen  seelenvollen \r\nAusdruck  der  Stimme,  der  Sprache  sich  geltend  machen \r\nkann.  Schon  ihr  Gesang  ist  nicht  von  zusagender  Fülle. \r\nUnd  so  mag  es  sich  auch  am  Ende  mit  jenen  starren  Bil- \r\ndern verhalten.  Schöne  Personen  gibts  überall,  tief  emp- \r\nfindende, zugleich  mit  günstigen  Sprachorganen  versehene \r\n\r\n\r\n350  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nviel  seltener,  am  allerseltensten  solche,  wo  zu  allem  die- \r\nsen noch  eine  einnehmende  Gestalt  hinzutritt. \r\n\r\nAuf  Herders  dritten  Teil  freu  ich  mich  sehr.  Hebet  mir \r\nihn  auf,  bis  ich  sagen  kann,  wo  er  mir  begegnen  soll.  Er \r\nwird  gewiß  den  schönen  Traumwunsch  der  Menschheit, \r\ndaß  es  dereinst  besser  mit  ihr  werden  solle,  trefflich  aus- \r\ngeführt haben.  Auch,  muß  ich  selbst  sagen,  halt  ich  es \r\nfür  wahr,  daß  die  Humanität  endlich  siegen  wird;  nur \r\nfurcht  ich,  daß  zu  gleicher  Zeit  die  Welt  ein  großes  Hos- \r\npital und  einer  des  andern  humaner  Krankenwärter  sein \r\nwerde. \r\n\r\nDen  28.  Mai. \r\nDer  gute  und  so  brauchbare  Volkmann  nötigt  mich  von \r\nZeit  zu  Zeit,  von  seiner  Meinung  abzugehen.  Er  spricht \r\nzum  Beispiel,  daß  dreißig-  bis  vierzigtausend  Müßig- \r\ngänger in  Neapel  zu  finden  wären;  und  wer  sprichts  ihm \r\nnicht  nach!  Ich  vermutete  zwar  sehr  bald  nach  einiger \r\nerlangter  Kenntnis  des  südlichen  Zustandes,  daß  dies \r\nwohl  eine  nordische  Ansicht  sein  möchte,  wo  man  jeden \r\nfür  einen  Müßiggänger  hält,  der  sich  nicht  den  ganzen \r\nTag  ängstlich  abmüht.  Ich  wendete  deshalb  vorzügliche \r\nAufmerksamkeit  auf  das  Volk,  es  mochte  sich  bewegen \r\noder  in  Ruhe  verharren,  und  konnte  zwar  sehr  viel \r\nübelgekleidete  Menschen  bemerken,  aber  keine  unbe- \r\nschäftigte. \r\n\r\nIch  fragte  deswegen  einige  Freunde  nach  den  unzähligen \r\nMüßiggängern,  welche  ich  doch  auch  wollte  kennen  ler- \r\nnen; sie  konnten  mir  aber  solche  ebensowenig  zeigen,  und \r\nso  ging  ich,  weil  die  Untersuchung  mit  Betrachtung  der \r\nStadt  genau  zusammenhing,  selbst  auf  die  Jagd  aus. \r\nIch  fing  an,  mich  in  dem  ungeheuren  Gewirre  mit  den \r\nverschiedenen  Figuren  bekannt  zu  machen,  sie  nach  ihrer \r\nGestalt,  Kleidung,  Betragen,  Beschäftigung  zu  beurteilen \r\nund  zu  klassifizieren.  Ich  fand  d'ese  Operation  hier  leich- \r\nter als  irgendwo,  weil  der  Mensch  sich  hier  mehr  selbst \r\ngelassen  ist  und  sich  seinem  Stande  auch  äußerlich  ge- \r\nmäß bezeigt. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  351 \r\n\r\nIch  fing  meine  Beobachtung  bei  früher  Tageszeit  an,  und \r\nalle  die  Menschen,  die  ich  hie  und  da  stillstehen  oder \r\nruhen  fand,  waren  Leute,  deren  Beruf  es  in  dem  Augen- \r\nblick mit  sich  brachte. \r\n\r\nDie  Lastträger,  die  an  verschiedenen  Plätzen  ihre  privi- \r\nlegierten Stände  haben  und  nur  erwarten,  bis  sich  jemand \r\nihrer  bedienen  will;  die  Calessaren,  ihre  Knechte  und \r\nJungen,  die  bei  den  einspännigen  Kaleschen  auf  großen \r\nPlätzen  stehen,  ihre  Pferde  besorgen  und  einem  jeden, \r\nder  sie  verlangt,  zu  Diensten  sind;  Schifter,  die  auf  dem \r\nMolo  ihre  Pfeife  rauchen;  Fischer,  die  an  der  Sonne \r\nliegen,  weil  vielleicht  ein  ungünstiger  Wind  weht,  der \r\nihnen  auf  das  Meer  auszufahren  verbietet.  Ich  sah  auch \r\nwohl  noch  manche  hin  und  wider  gehen,  doch  trug  meist \r\nein  jeder  ein  Zeichen  seiner  Tätigkeit  mit  sich.  Von \r\nBettlern  war  keiner  zu  bemerken  als  ganz  alte,  völlig  un- \r\nfähige und  krüppelhafte  Menschen.  Je  mehr  ich  mich  um- \r\nsah, je  genauer  ich  beobachtete,  desto  weniger  könnt  ich, \r\nweder  von  der  geringen  noch  von  der  mittlem  Klasse, \r\nweder  am  Morgen  noch  den  größten  Teil  des  Tages,  ja \r\nvon  keinem  Alter  und  Geschlecht  eigentliche  Müßiggänger \r\nfinden. \r\n\r\nIch  gehe  in  ein  näheres  Detail,  um  das,  was  ich  behaupte, \r\nglaubwürdiger  und  anschaulicher  zu  machen.  Die  klein- \r\nsten Kinder  sind  auf  mancherlei  Weise  beschäftigt.  Ein \r\ngroßer  Teil  derselben  trägt  Fische  zum  Verkauf  von \r\nSanta  Lucia  in  die  Stadt;  andere  sieht  man  sehr  oft  in \r\nder  Gegend  des  Arsenals,  oder  wo  sonst  etwas  gezim- \r\nmert wird,  wobei  es  Späne  gibt,  auch  am  Meere,  welches \r\nReiser  und  kleines  Holz  auswirft,  beschäftigt,  sogar  die \r\nkleinsten  Stückchen  in  Körbchen  aufzulesen.  Kinder  von \r\neinigen  Jahren,  die  nur  auf  der  Erde  so  hinkriechen,  in \r\nGesellschaft  älterer  Knaben  von  fünf  bis  sechs  Jahren, \r\nbefassen  sich  mit  diesem  kleinen  Gewerbe.  Sie  gehen \r\nnachher  mit  dem  Körbchen  tiefer  in  die  Stadt  und  setzen \r\nsich  mit  ihren  kleinen  Holzportionen  gleichsam  zu  Markte. \r\nDer  Handwerker,  der  kleine  Bürger  kauft  es  ihnen  ab,  brennt \r\nes  auf  seinem  Dreifuß  zu  Kohlen,  um  sich  daran  zu  erwär- \r\nmen, oder  verbraucht  es  in  seiner  sparsamen  Küche. \r\n\r\n\r\n352  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nAndere  Kinder  tragen  das  Wasser  der  Schwefelquellen, \r\nwelches  besonders  im  Frühjahr  sehr  stark  getrunken  wird, \r\nzum  Verkauf  herum.  Andere  suchen  einen  kleinen  Ge- \r\nwinn, indem  sie  übst,  gesponnenen  Honig,  Kuchen  und \r\nZuckerware  einkaufen  und  wieder,  als  kindische  Han- \r\ndelsleute, den  übrigen  Kindern  anbieten  und  verkaufen; \r\nallenfalls  nur,  um  ihren  Teil  daran  umsonst  zu  haben. \r\nEs  ist  wirklich  artig  anzusehen,  wie  ein  solcher  Junge, \r\ndessen  ganzer  Kram  und  Geratschaft  in  einem  Brett  und \r\nMesser  besteht,  eine  Wassermelone  oder  einen  halben \r\ngebratenen  Kürbis  herumträgt,  wie  sich  um  ihn  eine \r\nSchar  Kinder  versammlet,  wie  er  sein  Brett  niedersetzt \r\nund  die  Frucht  in  kleine  Stücke  zu  zerteilen  anfängt.  Die \r\nKäufer  spannen  sehr  ernsthaft,  ob  sie  auch  für  ihr  klein \r\nStückchen  Kupfergeld  genug  erhalten  sollen,  und  der \r\nkleine  Handelsmann  traktiert  gegen  die  Begierigen  die \r\nSache  ebenso  bedächtig,  damit  er  ja  nicht  um  ein  Stück- \r\nchen betrogen  werde.  Ich  bin  überzeugt,  daß  man  bei \r\nlängerem  Aufenthalt  noch  manche  Beispiele  solches  kind- \r\nlichen Erwerbes  sammeln  könnte. \r\n\r\nEine  sehr  große  Anzahl  von  Menschen,  teils  mittlem \r\nAlters,  teils  Knaben,  welche  meistenteils  sehr  schlecht \r\ngekleidet  sind,  beschäftigen  sich,  das  Kehricht  auf  Eseln \r\naus  der  Stadt  zu  bringen.  Das  nächste  Feld  um  Neapel \r\nist  nur  ein  Küchengarten,  und  es  ist  eine  Freude,  zu \r\nsehen,  welche  unsägliche  Menge  von  Küchengewächsen \r\nalle  Markttage  hereingeschaftt  wird  und  wie  die  Industrie \r\nder  Menschen  sogleich  die  überflüssigen,  von  den  Köchen \r\nverworfenen  Teile  wieder  in  die  Felder  bringt,  um  den \r\nZirkel  der  Vegetation  zu  beschleunigen.  Bei  der  unglaub- \r\nlichen Konsumtion  von  Gemüse  maclien  wirklich  die \r\nStrünke  und  Blätter  von  Blumenkohl,  Broccoli,  Arti- \r\nschocken, Kohl,  Salat,  Knoblauch  einen  großen  Teil  des \r\nneapolitanischen  Kehrichts  aus;  diesen  wird  denn  auch \r\nbesonders  nachgestrebt.  Zwei  große  biegsame  Körbe \r\nhängen  auf  dem  Rücken  eines  Esels  und  werden  nicht \r\nallein  ganz  voll  gefüllt,  sondern  noch  auf  jeden  mit  be- \r\nsonderer Kunst  ein  Haufen  aufgetürmt.  Kein  Garten \r\nkann  ohne  einen  solchen  Esel  bestehen.  Ein  Knecht,  ein \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  353 \r\n\r\nKnabe,  manchmal  der  Patron  selbst,  eilen  des  Tags  so \r\noft  als  möglich  nach  der  Stadt,  die  ihnen  zu  allen  Stun- \r\nden eine  reiche  Schatzgrube  ist.  Wie  aufmerksam  diese \r\nSammler  auf  den  Mist  der  Pferde  und  Maultiere  sind, \r\nläßt  sich  denken.  Ungern  verlassen  sie  die  Straße,  wenn \r\nes  Nacht  wird,  und  die  Reichen,  die  noch  Mitternacht \r\naus  der  Oper  fahren,  denken  wohl  nicht,  daß  schon  vor \r\nAnbruch  des  Tages  ein  emsiger  Mensch  sorgfältig  die \r\nSpuren  ihrer  Pferde  aufsuchen  wird.  Man  hat  mir  ver- \r\nsichert, daß  ein  paar  solche  Leute,  die  sich  zusammen- \r\ntun, sich  einen  Esel  kaufen  und  einem  größern  Besitzer \r\nein  Stückchen  Krautland  abpachten,  durch  anhaltenden \r\nFleiß  in  dem  glücklichen  Klima,  in  welchem  die  Vege- \r\ntation niemals  unterbrochen  wird,  es  bald  soweit  bringen, \r\ndaß  sie  ihr  Gewerbe  ansehnlich  erweitern. \r\nIch  würde  zu  weit  aus  meinem  Wege  gehen,  wenn  ich \r\nhier  von  der  mannigfaltigen  Kramerei  sprechen  wollte, \r\nwelche  man  mit  Vergnügen  in  Neapel,  wie  in  jedem  an- \r\ndern großen  Orte,  bemerkt;  allein  ich  muß  doch  hier  von \r\nden  Herumträgern  sprechen,  weil  sie  der  letztern  Klasse \r\ndes  Volks  besonders  angehören.  Einige  gehen  herum  mit \r\nFäßchen  Eiswasser,  Gläsern  und  Zitronen,  um  überall \r\ngleich  Limonade  machen  zu  können,  einen  Trank,  den \r\nauch  der  Geringste  nicht  zu  entbehren  vermag;  andere \r\nmit  Kredenztellern,  auf  welchen  Flaschen  mit  verschie- \r\ndenen Likören  und  Spitzgläsern  in  hölzernen  Ringen, \r\nvor  dem  Fallen  gesichert,  stehen;  andere  tragen  Körbe \r\nallerlei  Backwerks,  Näscherei,  Zitronen  und  anderes \r\nObst  umher,  und  es  scheint,  als  wolle  jeder  das  große \r\nFest  des  Genusses,  das  in  Neapel  alle  Tage  gefeiert  wird, \r\nmitgenießen  und  vermehren. \r\n\r\nWie  diese  Art  Herumträger  geschäftig  sind,  so  gibt  es \r\nnoch  eine  Menge  kleine  Krämer,  welche  gleichfalls  her- \r\numgehen und,  ohne  viele  Umstände,  auf  einem  Brett \r\nin  einem  Schachteldeckel  ihre  Kleinigkeiten,  oder  auf \r\nPlätzen  geradezu  auf  flacher  Erde  ihren  Kram  ausbieten. \r\nDa  ist  nicht  von  einzelnen  Waren  die  Rede,  die  man \r\nauch  in  größern  Läden  fände;  es  ist  der  eigentliche  Trö- \r\ndelkram.   Kein  Stückchen  Eisen.  Leder,  Tuch,   Leine- \r\n\r\n.  GOETHE  IV    23 \r\n\r\n\r\n354  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nwand,  Filz  usw.,  das  nicht  wieder  als  Trödelware  zu \r\nMarkte  käme  und  das  nicht  wieder  von  einem  oder  dem \r\nandern  gekauft  würde.  Noch  sind  viele  Menschen  der \r\nniedern  Klasse  Ijei  Handelsleuten  und  Handwerkern  als \r\nBeiläufer  und  Handlanger  beschäftigt. \r\nEs  ist  wahr,  man  tut  nur  wenig  Schritte,  ohne  einem  sehr \r\nübel  gekleideten,  ja  sogar  einem  zerlumpten  Menschen \r\nzu  begegnen,  aber  dies  ist  deswegen  noch  kein  Faulenzer, \r\nkein  Tagedieb!  Ja  ich  möchte  fast  das  Paradoxon  auf- \r\nstellen, daß  zu  Neapel  verhältnismäl5ig  vielleicht  noch \r\ndie  meiste  Industrie  in  der  ganz  niedern  Klasse  zu  finden \r\nsei.  Freilich  dürfen  wir  sie  nicht  mit  einer  nordischen \r\nIndustrie  vergleichen,  die  nicht  allein  für  Tag  und  Stunde, \r\nsondern  am  guten  und  heitern  Tage  für  den  bösen  und \r\ntrüben,  im  Sommer  für  den  Winter  zu  sorgen  hat.  Da- \r\ndurch, daß  der  Nordländer  zur  Vorsorge,  zur  Einrichtung \r\nvon  der  Natur  gezwungen  wird,  daß  die  Hausfrau  ein- \r\nsalzen und  räuchern  muß,  um  die  Küche  das  ganze  Jahr \r\nzu  versorgen,  daß  der  Mann  den  Holz-  und  Fruchtvorrat, \r\ndas  Futter  für  das  Vieh  nicht  aus  der  Acht  lassen  darf \r\nusw.,  dadurch  werden  die  schönsten  Tage  und  Stunden \r\ndem  Genuß  entzogen  und  der  Arbeit  gewidmet.  Mehrere \r\nMonate  lang  entfernt  man  sich  gern  aus  der  freien  Luft \r\nund  verwahrt  sich  in  Häusern  vor  Sturm,  Regen,  Schnee \r\nund  Kälte;  unaufhaltsam  folgen  die  Jahreszeiten  aufein- \r\nander, und  jeder,  der  nicht  zugrunde  gehen  will,  muß  ein \r\nHaushälter  werden.  Denn  es  ist  hier  gar  nicht  die  Frage, \r\nob  er  entbehren  wolle:  er  darf  nicht  entbehren  wollen, \r\ner  kann  nicht  entbehren  wollen,  denn  er  kann  nicht  ent- \r\nbehren; die  Natur  zwingt  ihn,  zu  schaffen,  vorzuarbeiten. \r\nGewiß  haben  die  Naturwirkungen,  welche  sich  Jahrtau- \r\nsende gleichbleiben,  den  Charakter  der  in  so  manchem \r\nBetracht  ehrwürdigen  nordischen  Nationen  bestimmt. \r\nDagegen  beurteilen  wir  die  südlichen  Völker,  mit  wel- \r\nchen der  Himmel  so  gelinde  umgegangen  ist,  aus  unserm \r\nGesichtspunkte  zu  streng.  Was  Herr  von  Pauw  in  seinen \r\nRecherches  sur  les  Grecs  bei  Gelegenheit,  da  er  von  den \r\nzynischen  Philosophen  spricht,  zu  äußern  wagt,  paßt \r\nvöllig  hieher.   Man  mache  sich,  glaubt  er,  von  dem  elen- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  355 \r\n\r\nden  Zustande  solcher  Menschen  nicht  den  richtigsten \r\nBegriff;  ihr  Grundsatz,  alles  zu  entbehren,  sei  durch  ein \r\nKlima  sehr  begünstigt,  das  alles  gewährt.  Ein  armer,  uns \r\nelend  scheinender  Mensch  könne  in  den  dortigen  Ge- \r\ngenden die  nötigsten  und  nächsten  Bedürfnisse  nicht \r\nallein  befriedigen,  sondern  die  Welt  aufs  schönste  ge- \r\nnießen; und  ebenso  möchte  ein  sogenannter  neapolita- \r\nnischer Bettler  die  Stelle  eines  Vizekönigs  in  Norwegen \r\nleicht  verschmähen  und  die  Ehre  ausschlagen,  wenn  ihm \r\ndie  Kaiserin  von  Rußland  das  Gouvernement  von  Sibirien \r\nübertragen  wollte. \r\n\r\nGewiß  würde  in  unsern  Gegenden  ein  zynischer  Philo- \r\nsoph schlecht  ausdauern,  da  hingegen  in  südlichen  Län- \r\ndern die  Natur  gleichsam  dazu  einladet.  Der  zerlumpte \r\nMensch  ist  dort  noch  nicht  nackt;  derjenige,  der  weder \r\nein  eigenes  Haus  hat  noch  zur  Miete  wohnt,  sondern  im \r\nSommer  unter  den  Überdächern  auf  den  Schwellen  der \r\nPaläste  und  Kirchen,  in  öffentlichen  Hallen  die  Nacht \r\nzubringt  und  sich  bei  schlechtem  Wetter  irgendwo  gegen \r\nein  geringes  Schlafgeld  untersteckt,  ist  deswegen  noch \r\nnicht  verstoßen  und  elend;  ein  Mensch  noch  nicht  arm, \r\nweil  er  nicht  für  den  andern  Tag  gesorgt  hat.  Wenn  man \r\nnur  bedenkt,  was  das  fischreiche  Meer,  von  dessen  Pro- \r\ndukten sich  jene  Menschen  gesetzmäßig  einige  Tage  der \r\nWoche  nähren  müssen,  für  eine  Masse  von  Nahrungs- \r\nmitteln anbietet;  wie  allerlei  Obst  und  Gartenfrüchte  zu \r\njeder  Jahreszeit  in  Überfluß  zu  haben  sind,  wie  die  Ge- \r\ngend, worin  Neapel  liegt,  den  Namen  Terra  di  Lavoro \r\n(nicht  das  Land  der  Arbeit^  sondern  das  Land  des \r\nAckerbaues)  sich  verdienet  hat  und  die  ganze  Provinz \r\nden  Ehrentitel  der  glücklichen  Gegend  (Campagna  felice) \r\nschon  Jahrhunderte  trägt:  so  läßt  sich  wohl  begreifen, \r\nwie  leicht  dort  zu  leben  sein  möge. \r\nÜberhaupt  würde  jenes  Paradoxon,  welches  ich  oben  ge- \r\nwagt habe,  zu  manchen  Betrachtungen  Anlaß  geben, \r\nwenn  jemand  ein  ausführliches  Gemälde  von  Neapel  zu \r\nschreiben  unternehmen  sollte;  wozu  denn  freilich  kein \r\ngeringes  Talent  und  manches  Jahr  Beobachtung  erforder- \r\nlich sein  möchte.  Man  würde  alsdann  im  ganzen  vielleicht \r\n\r\n\r\n356  ITAT JENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nbemerken,  daß  der  sogenannte  Lazarone  nicht  um  ein \r\nHaar  untätiger  ist  als  alle  übrigen  Klassen,  zugleich  aber \r\nauch  wahrnehmen,  daß  alle  in  ihrer  Art  nicht  arbeiten, \r\num  bloß  zu  Ichcn^  sondern  um  zu  genießen,  und  daß  sie \r\nsogar  bei  der  Arbeit  des  Lebens  froh  werden  wollen. \r\nEs  erklärt  sich  hiedurch  gar  manches:  daß  die  Hand- \r\nwerker beinahe  diu-chaus  gegen  die  nordischen  Länder \r\nsehr  zurück  sind;  daß  Fabriken  nicht  zustande  kommen; \r\ndaß,  außer  Sachwaltern  und  Ärzten,  in  Verhältnis  zu \r\nder  großen  Masse  von  Menschen  wenig  Gelehrsamkeit \r\nangetroffen  wird,  so  verdiente  Männer  sich  auch  im  ein- \r\nzelnen bemühen  mögen;  daß  kein  Maler  der  neapolita- \r\nnischen Schule  jemals  gründlich  gewesen  und  groß  ge- \r\nworden ist;  daß  sich  die  Geistlichen  im  Müßiggange  am \r\nwohlsten  sein  lassen  und  auch  die  Großen  ihre  Güter \r\nmeist  nur  in  sinnhchen  Freuden,  Pracht  und  Zerstreuung \r\ngenießen  mögen. \r\n\r\nIch  weiß  wohl,  daß  dies  viel  zu  allgemein  gesagt  ist  und \r\ndaß  die  Charakterzüge  jeder  Klasse  nur  erst  nach  einer \r\ngenauem  Bekanntschaft  und  Beobachtung  rein  gezogen \r\nwerden  können;  allein  im  ganzen  würde  man  doch,  glaube \r\nich,  auf  diese  Resultate  treflen. \r\n\r\nIch  kehre  wieder  zu  dem  geringen  Volke  in  Neapel  zu- \r\nrück. Man  bemerkt  bei  ihnen,  wie  bei  frohen  Kindern, \r\ndenen  man  etwas  aufträgt,  daß  sie  zwar  ihr  Geschäft \r\nverrichten,  aber  auch  zugleich  einen  Scherz  aus  dem \r\nGeschäft  machen.  Durchgängig  ist  diese  Klasse  von \r\nMenschen  eines  sehr  lebhaften  Geistes  und  zeigt  einen \r\nfreien  richtigen  Blick.  Ihre  Sprache  soll  figürlich,  ihr \r\nWitz  sehr  lebhaft  und  beißend  sein.  Das  alte  Atella  lag \r\nin  der  Gegend  von  Neapel,  und  wie  ihr  geliebter  Pul- \r\ncinell  noch  jene  Spiele  fortsetzt,  so  nimmt  die  ganz  ge- \r\nmeine Klasse  von  Menschen  noch  jetzt  Anteil  an  dieser \r\nLaune. \r\n\r\nPlinius,  im  fünften  Kapitel  des  dritten  Buchs  seiner  Na- \r\nturgeschichte, hält  Kampanicn  allein  einer  weitläufigen \r\nBeschreibung  wert. \r\n\"So  glücklich,  anmutig,  selig  sind  jene  Gegenden,\"  sagt \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  357 \r\n\r\ner,  \"daß  man  erkennt,  an  diesem  Orte  habe  die  Natur \r\nsich  ihres  Werks  erfreut.  Denn  diese  Lebensluft,  diese \r\nimmer  heilsame  Milde  des  Himmels,  so  fruchtbare  Fel- \r\nder, so  sonnige  Hügel,  so  unschädliche  Waldungen,  so \r\nschattige  Haine,  so  nutzbare  Wälder,  so  luftige  Berge, \r\nso  ausgebreitete  Saaten,  solch  eine  Fülle  von  Reben  und \r\nÖlbäumen,  so  edle  Wolle  der  Schafe,  so  fette  Nacken \r\nder  Stiere,  so  viel  Seen,  so  ein  Reichtum  von  durch- \r\nwässernden Flüssen  und  Quellen,  so  viele  INIeere,  so  viele \r\nHafen!  Die  Erde  selbst,  die  ihren  Schoß  überall  dem \r\nHandel  eröffnet  und,  gleichsam  dem  Menschen  nachzu- \r\nhelfen begierig,  ihre  Arme  in  das  Meer  hinausstreckt. \r\n\"Ich  erwähne  nicht  die  Fähigkeiten  der  Menschen,  ihre \r\nGebräuche,  ihre  Kräfte,  und  wie  viele  Völker  sie  durch \r\nSprache  und  Hand  überwunden  haben. \r\n\"Von  diesem  Lande  fällten  die  Griechen,  ein  Volk,  das \r\nsich  selbst  unmäßig  zu  rühmen  pflegte,  das  ehrenvollste \r\nUrteil,  indem  sie  einen  Teil  davon  Großgriechenland \r\nnannten.\" \r\n\r\nDeji  2g.  Mai. \r\nEine  ausgezeichnete  Fröhlichkeit  erblickt  man  überall \r\nmit  dem  größten  teilnehmenden  Vergnügen.  Die  viel- \r\nfarbigen bunten  Blumen  und  Früchte,  mit  welchen  die \r\nNatur  sich  ziert,  scheinen  den  Menschen  einzuladen,  sich \r\nund  alle  seine  Gerätschaften  mit  so  hohen  Farben  als \r\nmöglich  auszuputzen.  Seidene  Tücher  und  Binden,  Blu- \r\nmen auf  den  Hüten  schmücken  einen  jeden,  der  es \r\neinigermaßen  vermag.  Stühle  und  Kommoden  in  den \r\ngeringsten  Häusern  sind  auf  vergoldetem  Grund  mit  bun- \r\nten Blumen  geziert;  sogar  die  einspännigen  Kaleschen \r\nhochrot  angestrichen,  das  Schnitzwerk  vergoldet,  die \r\nPferde  davor  mit  gemachten  Blumen,  hochroten  Quasten \r\nund  Rauschgold  ausgeputzt.  Manche  haben  Federbüsche, \r\nandere  sogar  kleine  Fähnchen  auf  den  Köpfen,  die  sich \r\nim  Laufe  nach  jeder  Bewegung  drehen.  Wir  pflegen  ge- \r\nwöhnlich die  Liebhaberei  zu  bunten  Farben  barbarisch \r\nund  geschmacklos  zu  nennen,  sie  kann  es  auch  auf  ge- \r\nwisse Weise  sein  und  werden;  allein  unter  einem  recht \r\n\r\n\r\n358  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nheitern  und  blauen  Himmel  ist  eigentlich  nichts  bunt, \r\ndenn  nichts  vermag  den  Glanz  der  Sonne  und  ihren \r\nWiderschein  im  Meer  zu  überstrahlen.  Die  lebhafteste \r\nFarbe  wird  durch  das  gewaltige  Licht  gedämpft,  und  weil \r\nalle  Farben,  jedes  Grün  der  Bäume  und  Pflanzen,  das \r\ngelbe,  braune,  rote  Erdreich  in  völliger  Kraft  auf  das \r\nAuge  wirken,  so  treten  dadurch  selbst  die  farbigen  Blu- \r\nmen und  Kleider  in  die  allgemeine  Harmonie.  Die  schar- \r\nlachnen  Westen  und  Röcke  der  Weiber  von  Nettuno,  mit \r\nbreitem  Gold  und  Silber  besetzt,  die  andern  farbigen \r\nNationaltrachten,  die  gemalten  Schiffe,  alles  scheint  sich \r\nzu  beeifern,  unter  dem  Glänze  des  Himmels  und  des \r\nMeeres  einigermaßen  sichtbar  zu  werden. \r\nUnd  wie  sie  leben,  so  begraben  sie  auch  ihre  Toten;  da \r\nstört  kein  schwarzer,  langsamer  Zug  die  Harmonie  der \r\nlustigen  Welt. \r\n\r\nIch  sah  ein  Kind  zu  Grabe  tragen.  Ein  rotsammetner, \r\ngroßer,  mit  Gold  breit  gestickter  Teppich  überdeckte  eine \r\nbreite  Bahre;  darauf  stand  ein  geschnitztes,  stark  vergol- \r\ndetes und  versilbertes  Kästchen,  worin  das  weißgekleidete \r\nlote  mit  rosenfarbnen  Bändern  ganz  überdeckt  lag.  Auf \r\nden  vier  Ecken  des  Kästchens  waren  vier  Engel,  ohnge- \r\nfähr  jeder  zwei  Fuß  hoch,  welche  große  Blumenbüschel \r\nüber  das  ruhende  Kind  hielten  und,  weil  sie  unten  nur  an \r\nDrähten  befestigt  waren,  so  wie  die  Bahre  sich  bewegte, \r\nwackelten  und  mild  belebende  Blumengerüche  auszu- \r\nstreuen schienen.  Die  Engel  schwankten  um  desto  hef- \r\ntiger, als  der  Zug  sehr  über  die  Straßen  wegeilte  und  die \r\nvorangehenden  Priester  und  die  Kerzenträger  mehr  liefen \r\nals  gingen. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  keine  Jahreszeit,  wo  man  sich  nicht  überall  von \r\nEßwaren  umgeben  sähe,  und  der  Neapolitaner  freut  sich \r\nnicht  allein  des  Essens,  sondern  er  will  auch,  daß  die \r\nWare  zum  Verkauf  schön  aufgeputzt  sei. \r\nBei  Santa  Lucia  sind  die  Fische  nach  ihren  Gattungen \r\nmeist  in  reinlichen  und  artigen  Körben,  Krebse,  Austern, \r\nScheiden,  kleine  Muscheln,  Jedes  besonders  aufgetischt \r\nund  mit  grünen  Blättern  unterlegt.    Die  Läden  von  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  359 \r\n\r\ntrocknetem  Obst  und  Hülsenfrüchten  sind  auf  das  mannig- \r\nfaltigste herausgeputzt.  Die  ausgebreiteten  Pomeranzen \r\nund  Zitronen  von  allen  Sorten,  mit  dazwischen  hervor- \r\nstechendem grünen  Laub,  dem  Auge  sehr  erfreulich.  Aber \r\nnirgends  putzen  sie  mehr  als  bei  den  Fleischwaren,  nach \r\nwelchen  das  Auge  des  Volks  besonders  lüstern  gerichtet \r\nist,  weil  der  Appetit  durch  periodisches  Entbehren  nur \r\nmehr  gereizt  wird. \r\n\r\nIn  den  Fleischbänken  hängen  die  Teile  der  Ochsen,  Käl- \r\nber, Schöpse  niemals  aus,  ohne  daß  neben  dem  Fette  zu- \r\ngleich die  Seite  oder  die  Keule  stark  vergoldet  sei.  Es \r\nsind  verschiedene  Tage  im  Jahr,  besonders  die  Weih- \r\nnachtsfeiertage, als  Schmausfeste  berühmt;  alsdann  feiert \r\nman  eine  allgemeine  Cocagna,  wozu  sich  fünfhundert- \r\ntausend Menschen  das  Wort  gegeben  haben.  Dann  ist \r\naber  auch  die  Straße  Toledo  und  neben  ihr  mehrere \r\nStraßen  und  Plätze  auf  das  appetitlichste  verziert.  Die \r\nButiken,  wo  grüne  Sachen  verkauft  werden,  wo  Rosinen, \r\nMelonen  und  Feigen  aufgesetzt  sind,  erfreuen  das  Auge \r\nauf  das  allerangenehmste.  Die  Eßwaren  hängen  in  Gir- \r\nlanden über  die  Straßen  hinüber;  große  Paternoster  von \r\nvergoldeten,  mit  roten  Bändern  geschnürten  Würsten; \r\nwelsche  Hähne,  welche  alle  eine  rote  Fahne  unter  dem \r\nBürzel  stecken  haben.  Man  versicherte,  daß  deren  dreißig- \r\ntausend verkauft  worden,  ohne  die  zu  rechnen,  welche  die \r\nLeute  im  Hause  gemästet  hatten.  Außer  diesem  werden \r\nnoch  eine  Menge  Esel,  mit  grüner  Ware,  Kapaunen  und \r\njungen  Lämmern  beladen,  durch  die  Stadt  und  über  den \r\nMarkt  getrieben,  und  die  Haufen  Eier,  welche  man  hier \r\nund  da  sieht,  sind  so  groß,  daß  man  sich  ihrer  niemals \r\nso  viel  beisammen  gedacht  hat.  Und  nicht  genug,  daß \r\nalles  dieses  verzehrt  wird;  alle  Jahre  reitet  ein  Polizei- \r\ndiener mit  einem  Trompeter  durch  die  Stadt  und  ver- \r\nkündigt auf  allen  Plätzen  und  Kreuzwegen,  wie  viel \r\ntausend  Ochsen,  Kälber,  Lämmer,  Schweine  usw.  der \r\nNeapolitaner  verzehrt  habe.  Das  Volk  höret  aufmerksam \r\nzu,  freut  sich  unmäßig  über  die  großen  Zahlen,  und  jeder \r\nerinnert  sich  des  Anteils  an  diesem  Genüsse  mit  Ver- \r\ngnügen. \r\n\r\n\r\n36o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nWas  die  Mehl-  und  Milchspeisen  betrifft,  welche  unsere \r\nKöchinnen  so  mannigfaltig  zu  bereiten  wissen,  ist  für \r\njenes  Volk,  das  sich  in  dergleichen  Dingen  gerne  kurz \r\nfaßt  und  keine  wohleingerichtete  Küche  hat,  doppelt  ge- \r\nsorgt. Die  Makkaroni,  ein  zarter,  stark  durchgearbeiteter, \r\ngekochter,  in  gewisse  Gestalten  gepreßter  Teig  von  feinem \r\nMehle,  sind  von  allen  Sorten  überall  um  ein  geringes  zu \r\nhaben.  Sie  werden  meistens  nur  in  Wasser  abgekocht, \r\nund  der  geriebene  Käse  schmälzt  und  würzt  zugleich  die \r\nSchüssel.  Fast  an  der  Ecke  jeder  großen  Straße  sind  die \r\nBackwerksverfertiger  mit  ihren  Pfannen  voll  siedenden \r\nÖls,  besonders  an  Fasttagen,  beschäftigt,  Fische  und \r\nBackwerk  einem  jeden  nach  seinem  Verlangen  sogleich \r\nzu  bereiten.  Diese  Leute  haben  einen  unglaublichen \r\nAbgang,  und  viele  tausend  Menschen  tragen  ihr  Mittag- \r\nund  Abendessen  von  da  auf  einem  Stückchen  Papier \r\ndavon. \r\n\r\nDen  jo.  Mai. \r\nNachts  durch  die  Stadt  spazierend,  gelangt  ich  zum  Molo. \r\nDort  sah  ich  mit  einem  Blick  den  Mond,  den  Schein \r\ndesselben  auf  den  Wolkensäumen,  den  sanft  bewegten \r\nAbglanz  im  Meere,  heller  und  lebhafter  auf  dem  Saum \r\nder  nächsten  Welle.  Und  nun  die  Sterne  des  Himmels, \r\ndie  Lampen  des  Leuchtturms,  das  Feuer  des  Vesuvs,  den \r\nWiderschein  davon  im  Wasser  und  viele  einzelne  Lichter \r\nausgesät  über  die  Schitite.  Eine  so  mannigfaltige  Aufgabe \r\nhätt  ich  wohl  von  van  der  Neer  gelöst  sehen  mögen. \r\n\r\nDonnerstag  den  31.  Mal. \r\nIch  hatte  das  römische  Fronleichnamfcst  und  dabei  be- \r\nsonders die  nach  Raffael  gewirkten  Teppiche  so  fest  in \r\nden  Sinn  gefaßt,  daß  ich  mir  alle  diese  herrlichen  Natur- \r\nerscheinungen, ob  sie  schon  in  der  Welt  ihresgleichen \r\nnicht  haben  können,  keineswegs  irren  ließ,  sondern  die \r\nAnstalten  zur  Reise  hartnäckig  fortsetzte.  Ein  Paß  war \r\nbestellt,  ein  Vetturin  hatte  mir  den  Mietpfennig  gegeben; \r\ndenn  es  geschieht  dort  zur  Sicherheit  der  Reisenden  um- \r\ngekehrt als  bei  uns.     Kniep  war  beschäftigt,  sein  neues \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  361 \r\n\r\nQuartier  zu  beziehen,  an  Raum  und  Lage  viel  besser  als \r\ndas  vorige. \r\n\r\nSchon  früher,  als  diese  Veränderung  im  Werke  war,  hatte \r\nmir  der  Freund  einigemal  zu  bedenken  gegeben,  es  sei \r\ndoch  unangenehm  und  gewissermaßen  unanständig,  wenn \r\nman  in  ein  Haus  ziehe  und  gar  nichts  mitbringe;  selbst \r\nein  Bettgestell  flöße  den  Wirtsleuten  schon  einigen  Re- \r\nspekt ein.  Als  wir  nun  heute  durch  den  unendlichen  Trö- \r\ndel der  Kastellweitung  hindurchgingen,  sah  ich  so  ein \r\npaar  eiserne  Gestelle,  bronzeartig  angestrichen,  welche \r\nich  sogleich  feilschte  und  meinem  Freund  als  künftigen \r\nGrund  zu  einer  ruhigen  und  soliden  Schlafstätte  verehrte. \r\nEiner  der  allezeit  fertigen  Träger  brachte  sie  nebst  den \r\nerforderlichen  Brettern  in  das  neue  Quartier,  welche  An- \r\nstalt Kniepen  so  sehr  freute,  daß  er  sogleich  von  mir \r\nweg-  und  hier  einzuziehen  gedachte,  große  Reißbretter, \r\nPapier  und  alles  Nötige  schnell  anzuschaffen  besorgt  war. \r\nEinen  Teil  der  Konturen,  in  beiden  Sizilien  gezogen, \r\nübergab  ich  ihm  nach  unserer  Verabredung. \r\n\r\nDen  I.Juni. \r\n\r\nDie  Ankunft  des  Marquis  Lucchesini  hat  meine  Abreise \r\nauf  einige  Tage  weiter  geschoben;  ich  habe  viel  Freude \r\ngehabt,  ihn  kennen  zu  lernen.  Er  scheint  mir  einer  von \r\ndenen  Menschen  zu  sein,  die  einen  guten  moralischen \r\nMagen  haben,  um  an  dem  großen  Welttische  immer  mit- \r\ngenießen zu  können;  anstatt  daß  unsereiner,  wie  ein \r\nwiederkäuendes  Tier,  sich  zuzeiten  überfüllt  und  dann \r\nnichts  weiter  zu  sich  nehmen  kann,  bis  es  eine  wieder- \r\nholte Kauung  und  Verdauung  geendigt  hat.  Sie  gefällt \r\nmir  auch  recht  wohl;  sie  ist  ein  wackres,  deutsches \r\nWesen. \r\n\r\nIch  gehe  nun  gern  aus  Neapel,  ja  ich  muß  fort.  Diese \r\nletzten  Tage  überließ  ich  mich  der  Gefälligkeit,  Menschen \r\nzu  sehen.  Ich  habe  meist  interessante  Personen  kennen \r\nlernen  und  bin  mit  den  Stunden,  die  ich  ihnen  gewidmet, \r\nsehr  zufrieden;  aber  noch  vierzehn  Tage,  so  hätte  es  mich \r\nweiter  und  weiter  und  abwärts  von  meinem  Zwecke  ge- \r\nführt.   Und  dann  wird  man  hier  immer  untätiger.    Seit \r\n\r\n\r\n362  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nmeiner  Rückkunft  von  Pästum  habe  ich,  außer  den \r\nSchätzen  von  Portici,  wenig  gesehen,  und  es  bleibt  mir \r\nmanches  zurück,  um  dessentwillen  ich  nicht  den  Fuß \r\naufheben  mag.  Aber  jenes  Museum  ist  auch  das  0.  und  (u \r\naller  Antiquitätensammlungen;  da  sieht  man  recht,  was \r\ndie  alte  Welt  an  freudigem  Kunstsinn  voraus  war,  wenn \r\nsie  gleich  in  strenger  Handwerksfertigkeit  weit  hinter  uns \r\nzurückblieb. \r\n\r\nDer  Lohnbediente,  welcher  mir  den  ausgefertigten  Paß \r\nzustellte,  erzählte  zugleich,  meine  Abreise  bedauernd,  daß \r\neine  starke  Lava,  aus  dem  Vesuv  hervorgebrochen,  ihren \r\nWeg  nach  dem  Meer  zu  nehme;  an  den  steileren  Ab- \r\nhängen des  Berges  sei  sie  beinahe  schon  herab  und  könne \r\nwohl  in  einigen  Tagen  das  Ufer  erreichen.  Nun  befand \r\nich  mich  in  der  größten  Klemme.  Der  heutige  Tag  ging \r\nauf  Abschiedsbesuche  hin,  die  ich  so  vielen  wohlwollen- \r\nden und  befördernden  Personen  schuldig  war;  wie  es  mir \r\nmorgen  ergehen  wird,  sehe  ich  schon.  Einmal  kann  man \r\nsich  auf  seinem  Wege  den  Menschen  doch  nicht  völlig \r\nentziehen;  was  sie  uns  aber  auch  nutzen  und  zu  genießen \r\ngeben,  sie  reißen  uns  doch  zuletzt  von  unsern  ernstlichen \r\nZwecken  zur  Seite  hin,  ohne  daß  wir  die  ihrigen  fördern. \r\nIch  bin  äußerst  verdrießlich. \r\n\r\nAl>e?ids. \r\nAuch  meine  Dankbesuche  waren  nicht  ohne  Freude  und \r\nBelehrung:  man  zeigte  mir  noch  manches  freundlich  vor, \r\nwas  man  bisher  verschoben  oder  versäumt.  Cavaliere \r\nVenuti  ließ  mir  sogar  noch  verborgene  Schätze  sehen. \r\nIch  betrachtete  abermals  mit  großer  Verehrung  seinen, \r\nobgleich  verstümmelten,  doch  unschätzbaren  Ulysses.  Er \r\nführte  mich  zum  Abschied  in  die  Porzellainfabrik,  wo  ich \r\nmir  den  Herkules  möglichst  einprägte  und  mir  an  den \r\nkampanischen  Gefäßen  die  Augen  noch  einmal  recht \r\nvoll  sah. \r\n\r\nWahrhaft  gerührt  und  freundschaftlich  Abschied  nehmend, \r\nvertraute  er  mir  dann  noch  zuletzt,  wo  ihn  eigentlich  der \r\nSchuh  drücke,  und  wünschte  nichts  mehr,   als   daß  ich \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  363 \r\n\r\nnoch  eine  Zeitlang  mit  ihm  verweilen  könnte.  Mein  Ban- \r\nkier, bei  dem  ich  gegen  Tischzeit  eintraf,  ließ  mich  nicht \r\nlos.  Das  wäre  nun  alles  schön  und  gut  gewesen,  hätte \r\nnicht  die  Lava  meine  Einbildungskraft  an  sich  gezogen. \r\nUnter  mancherlei  Beschäftigungen,  Zahlungen  und  Ein- \r\npacken kam  die  Nacht  heran;  ich  aber  eilte  schnell  nach \r\ndem  Molo. \r\n\r\nHier  sah  ich  nun  alle  die  Feuer  und  Lichter  und  ihre \r\nWiderscheine,  nur  bei  bewegtem  Meer  noch  schwanken- \r\nder, den  Vollmond  in  seiner  ganzen  Herrlichkeit  neben \r\ndem  Sprühfeuer  des  Vulkans,  und  nun  die  Lava,  die  neu- \r\nlich fehlte,  auf  ihrem  glühenden  ernsten  Wege.  Ich  hätte \r\nnoch  hinausfahren  sollen,  aber  die  Anstalten  waren  zu \r\nweitschichtig,  ich  wäre  erst  am  Morgen  dort  angekommen. \r\nDen  Anblick,  wie  ich  ihn  genoß,  wollte  ich  mir  durch \r\nUngeduld  nicht  verderben:  ich  blieb  auf  dem  Molo  sitzen, \r\nbis  mir,  ohngeachtet  des  Zu-  und  Abströmens  der  Menge, \r\nihres  Deutens,  Erzählens,  Vergleichens,  Streitens,  wohin \r\ndie  Lava  strömen  werde,  und  was  dergleichen  Unfug  noch \r\nmehr  sein  mochte,  die  Augen  zufallen  wollten. \r\n\r\nSonnabend  den  2.  Juni. \r\nUnd  so  hätte  ich  auch  diesen  schönen  Tag  zwar  mit  vor- \r\nzüglichen Personen  vergnüglich  und  nützlich,  aber  doch \r\nganz  gegen  meine  Absichten  und  mit  schwerem  Herzen \r\nzugebracht.  Sehnsuchtsvoll  blickte  ich  nach  dem  Dampfe, \r\nder,  den  Berg  herab  langsam  nach  dem  Meere  ziehend, \r\nden  Weg  bezeichnete,  welchen  die  Lava  stündlich  nahm. \r\nAuch  der  Abend  sollte  nicht  frei  sein.  Ich  hatte  ver- \r\nsprochen, die  Herzogin  von  Giovane  zu  besuchen,  die  auf \r\ndem  Schlosse  wohnte,  wo  man  mich  denn  viele  Stufen \r\nhinauf  durch  manche  Gänge  wandern  ließ,  deren  oberste \r\nverengt  waren  durch  Kisten,  Schränke  und  alles  Miß- \r\nfällige eines  Hofgarderobewesens.  Ich  fand  in  einem \r\ngroßen  und  hohen  Zimmer,  das  keine  sonderliche  Aussicht \r\nhatte,  eine  wohlgestaltete  junge  Dame  von  sehr  zarter \r\nund  sittlicher  Unterhaltung.  Als  einer  gebornen  Deut- \r\nschen war  ihr  nicht  unbekannt,  wie  sich  unsere  Literatur \r\nzu  einer  freieren,  weit  umherblickenden  Humanität  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\n364  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nbildet:  Herders  Bemühungen,  und  was  ihnen  ähneUe, \r\nschätzte  sie  vorzüglich,  auch  Garvens  reiner  Verstand \r\nhatte  ihr  aufs  innigste  zugesagt.  Mit  den  deutsclicn \r\nSchriftstellerinnen  suchte  sie  gleichen  Schritt  zu  halten, \r\nund  es  ließ  sich  wohl  bemerken,  daß  es  ihr  Wunsch  sei, \r\neine  geübte  und  belobte  Feder  zu  führen.  Dahin  bezogen \r\nsich  ihre  Gespräche  und  verrieten  zugleich  die  Absicht, \r\nauf  die  Töchter  des  höchsten  Standes  zu  wirken.  Ein \r\nsolches  Gespräch  kennt  keine  Grenzen.  Die  Dämmerung \r\nwar  schon  eingebrochen,  und  man  hatte  noch  keine  Ker- \r\nzen gebracht.  Wir  gingen  im  Zimmer  auf  und  ab,  und \r\nsie,  einer  durch  Läden  verschlossenen  Fensterseite  sich \r\nnähernd,  stieß  einen  Laden  auf,  und  ich  erblickte,  was \r\nman  in  seinem  Leben  nur  einmal  sieht.  Tat  sie  es  ab- \r\nsichtlich, mich  zu  überraschen,  so  erreichte  sie  ihren \r\nZweck  vollkommen.  Wir  standen  an  einem  Fenster  des \r\noberen  Geschosses,  der  Vesuv  gerade  vor  uns;  die  herab- \r\nfließende Lava,  deren  Flamme  bei  längst  niedergegan- \r\ngener Sonne  schon  deutlich  glühte  und  ihren  begleitenden \r\nRauch  schon  zu  vergolden  anfing;  der  Berg  gewaltsam \r\ntobend,  über  ihm  eine  ungeheuere  feststehende  Dampf- \r\nwolke, ihre  verschiedenen  Massen  bei  jedem  Auswurf \r\nblitzartig  gesondert  und  körperhaft  erleuchtet.  Von  da \r\nherab  bis  gegen  das  Meer  ein  Streif  von  Gluten  und  glü- \r\nhenden Dünsten;  übrigens  Meer  und  Erde,  Fels  und \r\nWachstum  deutlich  in  der  Abenddämmerung,  klar  fried- \r\nlich, in  einer  zauberhaften  Ruhe.  Dies  alles  mit  einem \r\nBlick  zu  übersehen  und  den  hinter  dem  Bergrücken  hervor- \r\ntretenden Vollmond  als  die  Erfüllung  des  wunderbarsten \r\nBildes  zu  schauen,  mußte  wohl  Erstaunen  erregen. \r\nDies  alles  konnte  von  diesem  Standpunkt  das  Auge  mit \r\neinmal  fassen,  und  wenn  es  auch  die  einzelnen  Gegen- \r\nstände zu  mustern  nicht  imstande  war,  so  verlor  es  doch \r\nniemals  den  Eindruck  des  großen  Ganzen.  War  unser \r\nGespräch  durch  dieses  Schauspiel  unterbrochen,  so  nahm \r\nes  eine  desto  gemütlichere  Wendung.  Wir  hatten  nun \r\neinen  Text  vor  uns,  welchen  Jahrtausende  zu  kommen- \r\ntieren nicht  hinreichen.  Je  mehr  die  Nacht  wuchs,  desto \r\nmehr  schien  die  Gegend  an  Klarheit  zu  gewinnen,  der \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  1787  365 \r\n\r\nMond  leuchtete  wie  eine  zweite  Sonne;  die  Säulen  des \r\nRauchs,  dessen  Streifen  und  Massen  durchleuchtet,  bis \r\nins  einzelne  deutlich,  ja  man  glaubte  mit  halbweg  be- \r\nwaffnetem Auge  die  glühend  ausgeworfenen  Felsklumpen \r\nauf  der  Nacht  des  Kegelberges  zu  unterscheiden.  Meine \r\nWirtin  —  so  will  ich  sie  nennen,  weil  mir  nicht  leicht  ein \r\nköstlicheres  Abendmahl  zubereitet  war  — ■  ließ  die  Kerzen \r\nan  die  Gegenseite  des  Zimmers  stellen,  und  die  schöne \r\nFrau,  vom  Monde  beleuchtet,  als  Vordergrund  dieses  un- \r\nglaublichen Bildes,  schien  mir  immer  schöner  zu  werden, \r\nja  ihre  Lieblichkeit  vermehrte  sich  besonders  dadurch, \r\ndaß  ich  in  diesem  südlichen  Paradiese  eine  sehr  ange- \r\nnehme deutsche  Mundart  vernahm.  Ich  vergaß,  wie  spät \r\nes  war,  so  daß  sie  mich  zuletzt  aufmerksam  machte:  sie \r\nmüsse  mich,  wiewohl  ungerne,  entlassen;  die  Stunde  nahe \r\nschon,  wo  ihre  Galerien  klostermäßig  verschlossen  wür- \r\nden. Und  so  schied  ich  zaudernd  von  der  Ferne  und  von \r\nder  Nähe,  mein  Geschick  segnend,  das  mich  für  die  wider- \r\nwillige Artigkeit  des  Tages  noch  schön  am  Abend  belohnt \r\nhatte.  Unter  den  freien  Himmel  gelangt,  sagte  ich  mir \r\nvor,  daß  ich  in  der  Nähe  dieser  größern  Lava  doch  nur \r\ndie  Wiederholung  jener  kleinern  würde  gesehen  haben \r\nund  daß  mir  ein  solcher  Überblick,  ein  solcher  Abschied \r\naus  Neapel  nicht  anders  als  auf  diese  Weise  hätte  werden \r\nkönnen.  Anstatt  nach  Hause  zu  gehen,  richtete  ich  meine \r\nSchritte  nach  dem  Molo,  um  das  große  Schauspiel  mit \r\neinem  andern  Vordergrund  zu  sehen;  aber  ich  weiß  nicht, \r\nob  die  Ermüdung  nach  einem  so  reichen  Tage  oder  ein \r\nGefühl,  daß  man  das  letzte,  schöne  Bild  nicht  verwischen \r\nmüsse,  mich  wieder  nach  Moriconi  zurückzog,  wo  ich \r\ndenn  auch  Kniepen  fand,  der  aus  seinem  neu  bezognen \r\nQuartier  mir  einen  Abendbesuch  abstattete.  Bei  einer \r\nFlasche  Wein  besprachen  wir  unsere  künftigen  Verhält- \r\nnisse; ich  konnte  ihm  zusagen,  daß  er,  sobald  ich  etwas \r\nvon  seinen  Arbeiten  in  Deutschland  vorzeigen  könne,  ge- \r\nwiß dem  trefflichen  Herzog  Ernst  von  Gotha  empfohlen \r\nsein  und  von  dort  Bestellungen  erhalten  würde.  Und  so \r\nschieden  wir  mit  herzlicher  Freude,  mit  sicherer  Aussicht \r\nkünftiger  wechselseitig  wirkender  Tätigkeit. \r\n\r\n\r\n366  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  II \r\n\r\nSotititag  dot  3.  Juni.  Dreichiigkcitsfcst. \r\nUnd  so  fuhr  ich  denn  durch  das  unendliche  Leben  dieser \r\nunvergleichUchen  Stadt,  die  ich  wahrscheinhch  nicht \r\nwiedersehen  sollte,  halb  betäubt  hinaus;  vergnügt  jedoch, \r\ndaß  weder  Reue  noch  Schmerz  hinter  mir  blieb.  Ich \r\ndachte  an  den  guten  Kniep  und  gelobte  ihm  auch  in  der \r\nFerne  meine  beste  Vorsorge. \r\n\r\nAn  den  äußersten  Polizeischranken  der  Vorstadt  störte \r\nmich  einen  Augenblick  ein  Manjueur,  der  mir  freundlich \r\nins  Gesicht  sah,  aber  schnell  wieder  hinwegsprang.  Die \r\nZollmänner  waren  noch  nicht  mit  dem  Vetturin  fertig  ge- \r\nworden, als  aus  der  Kafifeebudentüre,  die  größte  chine- \r\nsische Tasse  voll  schwarzen  Kafitee  auf  einem  Präsentier- \r\nteller tragend,  Kniep  heraustrat.  Er  nahte  sich  dem \r\nWagenschlag  langsam  mit  einem  Ernst,  der,  von  Herzen \r\ngehend,  ihm  sehr  gut  kleidete.  Ich  war  erstaunt  und  ge- \r\nrührt, eine  solche  erkenntliche  Aufmerksamkeit  hat  nicht \r\nihresgleichen.  Sie  haben,  sagte  er,  mir  so  viel  Liebes  und \r\nGutes,  auf  mein  ganzes  Leben  Wirksames  erzeigt,  daß \r\nich  Ihnen  hier  ein  Gleichnis  anbieten  möchte,  was  ich \r\nIhnen  verdanke. \r\n\r\nDa  ich  in  solchen  Gelegenheiten  ohnehin  keine  Sprache \r\nhabe,  so  brachte  ich  nur  sehr  lakonisch  vor,  daß  er  durch \r\nseine  Tätigkeit  mich  schon  zum  Schuldner  gemacht  und \r\ndurch  Benutzung  und  Bearbeitung  unserer  gemeinsamen \r\nSchätze  mich  noch  immer  mehr  verbinden  werde. \r\nWir  schieden,  wie  Personen  selten  voneinander  scheiden, \r\ndie  sich  zufällig  auf  kurze  Zeit  verbunden.  Vielleicht \r\nhätte  man  viel  mehr  Dank  und  Vorteil  vom  Leben,  wenn \r\nman  sich  wechselsweise  gerade  heraus  spräche,  was  man \r\nvoneinander  erwartet.  Ist  das  geleistet,  so  sind  beide \r\nTeile  zufrieden,  und  das  Gemütliche,  was  das  Erste  und \r\nLetzte  von  allem  ist,  erscheint  als  reine  Zugabe. \r\n\r\nUiitcnoegs,  am  4.,  5.  iiiul  6.  Juni. \r\nDa  ich  diesmal  allein  reise,  habe  ich  Zeit  genug,  die  Ein- \r\ndrücke der  vergangenen  Monate  wieder  hervorzurufen; \r\nes  geschieht  mit  vielem  Behagen.    Und  doch  tritt  gar  oft \r\n\r\n\r\nNEAPEL  17S7  367 \r\n\r\ndas  Lückenhafte  der  Bemerkungen  hervor,  und  wenn  die \r\nReise  dem,  der  sie  vollbracht  hat,  in  einem  Flusse  vor- \r\nüberzuziehen scheint  und  in  der  Einbildungskraft  als  eine \r\nstetige  Folge  hervortritt,  so  fühlt  man  doch,  daß  eine \r\neigentliche  INIitteilung  unmöglich  sei.  Der  Erzählende \r\nmuß  alles  einzeln  hinstellen;  wie  soll  daraus  in  der  Seele \r\ndes  dritten  ein  Ganzes  gebildet  werden? \r\nDeshalb  konnte  mir  nichts  Tröstlicheres  und  Erfreulicheres \r\nbegegnen,  als  die  Versicherungen  eurer  letzten  Briefe: \r\ndaß  ihr  euch  fleißig  mit  Italien  und  Sizilien  beschäftigt, \r\nReisebeschreibungen  leset  und  Kupferwerke  betrachtet; \r\ndas  Zeugnis,  daß  dadurch  meine  Briefe  gewinnen,  ist \r\nmein  höchster  Trost.  Hättet  ihr  es  früher  getan  oder  aus- \r\ngesprochen, ich  wäre  noch  eifriger  gewesen,  als  ich  war. \r\nDaß  treffliche  Männer,  wie  Bartels,  Munter,  Architekten \r\nverschiedener  Nationen  vor  mir  hergingen,  die  gewiß \r\näußere  Zwecke  sorgfältiger  verfolgten  als  ich,  der  ich  nur \r\ndie  innerlichsten  im  Auge  hatte,  hat  mich  oft  beruhigt, \r\nwenn  ich  alle  meine  Bemühungen  für  unzulänglich  halten \r\nmußte. \r\n\r\nÜberhaupt,  wenn  jeder  Mensch  nur  als  ein  Supplement \r\naller  übrigen  zu  betrachten  ist  und  am  nützlichsten  und \r\nliebenswürdigsten  erscheint,  wenn  er  sich  als  einen  solchen \r\ngibt,  so  muß  dieses  vorzüglich  von  Reiseberichten  und \r\nReisenden  gültig  sein.  Persönlichkeit,  Zwecke,  Zeitver- \r\nhältnisse, Gunst  und  Ungunst  der  Zufälligkeiten,  alles  zeigt \r\nsich  bei  einem  jeden  anders.  Kenn  ich  seine  Vorgänger, \r\nso  werd  ich  auch  an  ihm  mich  freuen,  mich  mit  ihm  be- \r\nhelfen,  seinen  Nachfolger  erwarten  und  diesem,  wäre  mir \r\nsogar  inzwischen  das  Glück  geworden,  die  Gegend  selbst \r\nzu  besuchen,  gleichfalls  freundlich  begegnen. \r\n\r\n\r\nDRITTER  TEIL \r\n\r\n\r\nZWEITER  RÖMISCHER  AUFENTHALT \r\n\r\nvom  Juni  1787  bis  April  1788 \r\n\r\nLonga  Sit  hiiic  aetas  dotiiinaegne  potcntia  terrae \r\nSitque  sub  hac  oriens  occiduusqite  dies. \r\n\r\nJixni \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nRom,  den  8.  Juni  lySy. \r\n\r\nVORGESTERN  bin  ich  glücklich  wieder  hier  an- \r\ngelangt, und  gestern  hat  der  feierliche  Fronleich- \r\nnamstag mich  sogleich  wieder  zum  Römer  ein- \r\ngeweiht. Gern  will  ich  gestehen,  meine  Abreise  von \r\nNeapel  machte  mir  einige  Pein;  nicht  sowohl  die  herr- \r\nliche Gegend  als  eine  gewaltige  Lava  hinter  mir  lassend, \r\ndie  von  dem  Gipfel  aus  ihren  Weg  nach  dem  Meere  zu \r\nnahm,  die  ich  wohl  hätte  in  der  Nähe  betrachten,  deren  Art \r\nund  Weise,  von  der  man  so  viel  gelesen  und  erzählt  hat, \r\nich  in  meine  Erfahrungen  hätte  mit  aufnehmen  sollen. \r\nHeute  jedoch  ist  meine  Sehnsucht  nach  dieser  großen \r\nNaturszene  schon  wieder  ins  gleiche  gebracht;  nicht  so- \r\nwohl das  fromme  Festgewirre,  das  bei  einem  imposanten \r\nGanzen  doch  hie  und  da  durch  abgeschmacktes  Einzelne \r\nden  innern  Sinn  verletzt,  sondern  die  Anschauung  der \r\nTeppiche  nach  Raftaels  Kartonen  hat  mich  wieder  in \r\nden  Kreis  höherer  Betrachtungen  zurückgeführt.  Die \r\nvorzüglichsten,  die  ihm  am  gewissesten  ihren  Ursprung \r\nverdanken,  sind  zusammen  ausgebreitet,  andere,  wahr- \r\nscheinlich von  Schülern,  Zeit-  und  Kunstgenossen  er- \r\nfundene, schließen  sich  nicht  unwürdig  an  und  bedecken \r\ndie  grenzenlosen  Räume. \r\n\r\nDen  16.  Juni. \r\nLaßt  mich  auch  wieder,  meine  Lieben,  ein  Wort  zu  euch \r\nreden.  Mir  geht  es  sehr  wohl,  ich  finde  mich  immer \r\nmehr  in  mich  zurück  und  lerne  unterscheiden,  was  mir \r\neigen  und  was  mir  fremd  ist.  Ich  bin  fleißig  und  nehme \r\nvon  allen  Seiten  ein  und  wachse  von  innen  heraus.  Diese \r\nTage  war  ich  in  Tivoli  und  habe  eins  der  ersten  Natur- \r\nschauspiele gesehen.  Es  gehören  die  Wasserfälle  dort, \r\nmit  den  Ruinen  und  dem  ganzen  Komplex  der  Land- \r\n\r\n\r\n372  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nSchaft,  zu  denen  Gegenständen,  deren  Bekanntschaft  uns \r\nim  tiefsten  Grund  reicher  macht. \r\n\r\nAm  letzten  Posttage  habe  ich  versäumt,  zu  schreiben. \r\nIn  Tivoli  war  ich  sehr  müde  vom  Spazierengehen  und \r\nvom  Zeichnen  in  der  Hitze.  Ich  war  mit  Herrn  Hackert \r\ndraußen,  der  eine  unglaubliche  Meisterschaft  hat,  die \r\nNatur  abzuschreiben  und  der  Zeichnung  gleich  eine  Ge- \r\nstalt zu  geben.  Ich  habe  in  diesen  wenigen  Tagen  viel \r\nvon  ihm  gelernt. \r\n\r\nWeiter  mag  ich  gar  nichts  sagen.  Das  ist  wieder  ein \r\nGipfel  irdischer  Dinge.  Ein  sehr  komplizierter  Fall  in  der \r\nGegend  bringt  die  herrlichsten  Wirkungen  hervor. \r\nHerr  Hackert  hat  mich  gelobt  und  getadelt  und  mir \r\nweiter  geholfen.  Er  tat  mir  halb  im  Scherz,  halb  im  Ernst \r\nden  Vorschlag,  achtzehn  Monate  in  Italien  zu  bleiben \r\nund  mich  nach  guten  Grundsätzen  zu  üben;  nach  dieser \r\nZeit,  versprach  er  mir,  sollte  ich  Freude  an  meinen  Ar- \r\nbeiten haben.  Ich  sehe  auch  wohl,  was  und  wie  man \r\nstudieren  muß,  um  über  gewisse  Schwierigkeiten  hinaus- \r\nzukommen, unter  deren  Last  man  sonst  sein  ganzes  Le- \r\nben hinkriecht. \r\n\r\nNoch  eine  Bemerkung.  Jetzt  fangen  erst  die  Bäume,  die \r\nFelsen,  ja  Rom  selbst  an,  mir  lieb  zu  werden;  bisher  hab \r\nich  sie  immer  nur  als  fremd  gefühlt;  dagegen  freuten \r\nmich  geringe  Gegenstände,  die  mit  denen  Ähnlichkeit \r\nhatten,  die  ich  in  der  Jugend  sah.  Nun  muß  ich  auch \r\nerst  hier  zu  Hause  werden,  und  doch  kann  ichs  nie  so \r\ninnig  sein,  als  mit  jenen  ersten  Gegenständen  des  Lebens. \r\nIch  habe  verschiedenes  bezüglich  auf  Kunst  und  Nach- \r\nahmung bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  gedacht. \r\nWährend  meiner  Abwesenheit  hatte  Tischbein  ein  Ge- \r\nmälde von  Daniel  von  Volterra  im  Kloster  an  der  Porta \r\ndel  Popolo  entdeckt;  die  Geistlichen  wollten  es  für  tau- \r\nsend Scudi  hergeben,  welche  Tischbein  als  Künstler \r\nnicht  aufzutreiben  wußte.  Er  machte  daher  an  Madame \r\nAngelica  durch  Meyer  den  Vorschlag,  in  den  sie  willigte, \r\ngedachte  Summe  auszalilte,  das  Bild  zu  sich  nahm  und \r\nspäter  Tischbein  die  ihm  kontraktmäßige  Hälfte  um  ein \r\nnamhaftes  abkaufte.     Es  war  ein  vortreffliches  Bild,  die \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  373 \r\n\r\nGrablegung  vorstellend,  mit  vielen  Figuren.  Eine  von \r\nMeyer  darnach  sorgfältig  hergestellte  Zeichnung  ist  noch \r\nvorhanden. \r\n\r\nDen  20,  Juni. \r\nNun  hab  ich  hier  schon  wieder  treffliche  Kunstwerke \r\no-esehen,  und  mein  Geist  reinigt  und  bestimmt  sich.  Doch \r\nbrauchte  ich  wenigstens  noch  ein  Jahr  allein  in  Rom, \r\num  nach  meiner  Art  den  Aufenthalt  nutzen  zu  können, \r\nund  ihr  wißt,  ich  kann  nichts  auf  andre  Art.  Jetzt,  wenn \r\nich  scheide,  werde  ich  nur  wissen,  welcher  Sinn  mir \r\nnoch  nicht  aufgegangen  ist,  und  so  sei  es  denn  eine \r\nWeile  genug. \r\n\r\nDer  Herkules  Farnese  ist  fort;  ich  hab  ihn  noch  auf  sei- \r\nnen echten  Beinen  gesehen,  die  man  ihm  nach  so  langer \r\nZeit  wiedergab.  Nun  begreift  man  nicht,  wie  man  die \r\nersten,  von  Porta,  hat  so  lange  gut  linden  können.  Es \r\nist  nun  eins  der  vollkommensten  Werke  alter  Zeit.  In \r\nNeapel  wird  der  König  ein  Museum  bauen  lassen,  wo \r\nalles,  was  er  von  Kunstsachen  besitzt,  das  herkulanische \r\nMuseum,  die  Gemälde  von  Pompeji,  die  Gemälde  von \r\nCapo  di  Monte,  die  ganze  Farnesische  Erbschaft  ver- \r\neinigt aufgestellt  werden  sollen.  Es  ist  ein  großes  und \r\nschönes  Unternehmen.  Unser  Landsmann  Hackert  ist  die \r\nerste  Triebfeder  dieses  Werks.  Sogar  der  Toro  Farnese \r\nsoll  nach  Neapel  wandern  und  dort  auf  der  Promenade \r\naufgestellt  werden.  Könnten  sie  die  Carraccische  Galerie \r\naus  dem  Palaste  mitnehmen,  sie  tätens  auch. \r\n\r\nDen  2>].Juni. \r\nIch  war  mit  Hackert  in  der  Galerie  Colonna,  wo  Pous- \r\nsins,  Claudes,  Salvator  Rosas  Arbeiten  zusammen  hängen. \r\nEr  sagte  mir  viel  Gutes  und  gründlich  Gedachtes  über \r\ndiese  Bilder,  er  hat  einige  davon  kopiert  und  die  andern \r\nrecht  aus  dem  Fundament  studiert.  Es  freute  mich,  daß \r\nich  im  allgemeinen  bei  den  ersten  Besuchen  in  der  Ga- \r\nlerie eben  dieselbe  Vorstellung  gehabt  hatte.  Alles,  was \r\ner  mir  sagte,  hat  meine  Begriffe  nicht  geändert,  sondern \r\nnur  erweitert  und  bestimmt.  Wenn  man  nun  gleich  wie- \r\n\r\n\r\n3  7  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nder  die  Natur  ansehn  und  wieder  finden  und  lesen  kr.nn, \r\nwas  jene  gefunden  und  mehr  oder  weniger  nachgeahmt \r\nhaben,  das  muß  die  Seele  erweitern,   reinigen   und  ihr \r\nzuletzt  den  höchsten  anschauenden  Begriff  von  Natur  und \r\nKunst  geben.     Ich  will  auch  nicht  mehr  ruhen,  bis  mir \r\nnichts  mehr  Wort  und  Tradition,  sondern  lebendiger  Be- \r\ngriff ist.  Von  Jugend  auf  war  mir  dieses  mein  Trieb  und \r\nmeine  Plage;  jetzt,  da  das  Alter  kommt,  will  ich  wenig- \r\nstens das  Erreichbare  erreichen  und  das  Tuliche  tun,  da \r\nich  so  lange,  verdient  und  unverdient,  das  Schicksal 'des \r\nSisyphus  und  Tantalus  erduldet  habe. \r\nBleibt  in  der  Liebe  und  Glauben  an  mich.  Mit  den  Men- \r\nschen hab  ich  jetzt  ein  leidlich  Leben  und  eine  gute  Art \r\nOffenheit;  ich  bin  wohl  und  freue  mich  meiner  Tage. \r\nTischbein  ist  sehr  brav,  doch  fürchte  ich,   er  wird  nie \r\nin  einen  solchen  Zustand  kommen,  in  welchem  er  mit \r\nFreude  und  Freiheit  arbeiten  kann.    Mündlich  mehr  von \r\ndiesem  auch  wunderbaren  Menschen.   Mein  Porträt  wird \r\nglücklich;  es  gleicht  sehr,  und  der  Gedanke  gefällt  jeder- \r\nmann. Angelica  malt  mich  auch,  daraus  wird  aber  nichts; \r\nes  verdrießt  sie  sehr,  daß  es  nicht  gleichen  und  werden \r\nwill.  Es  ist  immer  ein  hübscher  Bursche,  aber  keine  Spur \r\nvon  mir. \r\n\r\nDen  jo.  Jiuü. \r\nDas  große  Fest  St.  Peter  und  Paul  ist  endlich  auch  her- \r\nangekommen; gestern  haben  wir  die  Erleuchtung  der \r\nKuppel  und  das  Feuerwerk  vom  Kastell  gesehn.  Die  Er- \r\nleuchtung ist  ein  Anblick  wie  ein  ungeheures  Märchen, \r\nman  traut  seinen  Augen  nicht.  Da  ich  neuerdings  nur \r\ndie  Sachen  und  nicht  wie  sonst  bei  und  mit  den  Sachen \r\nsehe,  was  nicht  da  ist,  so  müssen  mir  so  große  Schau- \r\nspiele kommen,  wenn  ich  mich  freuen  soU.  Ich  habe  auf \r\nmeiner  Reise  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  gezählt,  und  dieses \r\ndarf  allerdings  unter  den  ersten  stehn.  Die  schone  Forai \r\nder  Kolonnade,  der  Kirche  und  besonders  der  Kuppel, \r\nerst  in  einem  feurigen  Umrisse  und,  wenn  die  Stunde \r\nvorbei  ist,  in  einer  glühenden  Masse  zu  sehn,  ist  einzig \r\nund  herrlich.     Wenn  man  bedenkt,  daß  das  ungeheure \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  375 \r\n\r\nGebäude  in  diesem  Augenblick  nur  zum  Gerüste  dient, \r\nso  wird  man  wohl  begreifen,  daß  etwas  Ähnliches  in  der \r\nWelt  nicht  sein  kann.  Der  Himmel  war  rein  und  hell, \r\nder  Mond  schien  und  dämpfte  das  Feuer  der  Lampen \r\nzum  angenehmen  Schein;  zuletzt  aber,  wie  alles  durch \r\ndie  zweite  Erleuchtung  in  Glut  gesetzt  wurde,  ward  das \r\nLicht  des  Mondes  ausgelöscht.  Das  Feuerwerk  ist  wegen \r\ndes  Ortes  schön,  doch  lange  nicht  verhältnismäßig  zur \r\nErleuchtung.  Heute  abend  sehen  wir  beides  noch \r\neinmal. \r\n\r\nAuch  das  ist  vorüber.  Es  war  ein  schöner  klarer  Himmel \r\nund  der  Mond  voll,  dadurch  ward  die  Erleuchtung  sanf- \r\nter, und  es  sah  ganz  aus  wie  ein  Märchen.  Die  schöne \r\nForm  der  Kirche  und  der  Kuppel  gleichsam  in  einem \r\nfeurigen  Aufriß  zu  sehen,  ist  ein  großer  und  reizender \r\nAnblick. \r\n\r\nEnde  Juni. \r\nIch  habe  mich  in  eine  zu  große  Schule  begeben,  als  daß \r\nich  geschwind  wieder  aus  der  Lehre  gehen  dürfte.  Meine \r\nKunstkenntnisse,  meine  kleinen  Talente  müssen  hier  ganz \r\ndurchgearbeitet,  ganz  reif  werden,  sonst  bring  ich  wieder \r\neuch  einen  halben  Freund  zurück,  und  das  Sehnen,  Be- \r\nmühen, Krabbeln  und  Schleichen  geht  von  neuem  an. \r\nIch  würde  nicht  fertig  werden,  wenn  ich  euch  erzählen \r\nsollte,  wie  mir  auch  wieder  alles  diesen  Monat  hier  ge- \r\nglückt ist,  ja  wie  mir  alles  auf  einem  Teller  ist  präsentiert \r\nworden,  was  ich  nur  gewünscht  habe.  Ich  habe  ein  schönes \r\nQuartier,  gute  Hausleute.  Tischbein  geht  nach  Neapel, \r\nund  ich  beziehe  sein  Studium,  einen  großen  kühlen  Saal. \r\nWenn  ihr  mein  gedenkt,  so  denkt  an  mich  als  an  einen \r\nGlücklichen;  ich  will  oft  schreiben,  und  so  sind  und  bleiben \r\nwir  zusammen. \r\n\r\nAuch  neue  Gedanken  und  Einfälle  hab  ich  genug;  ich \r\nfinde  meine  erste  Jugend  bis  auf  Kleinigkeiten  wieder,  in- \r\ndem ich  mir  selbst  überlassen  bin,  und  dann  trägt  mich \r\ndie  Höhe  und  Würde  der  Gegenstände  wieder  so  hoch \r\nund  weit,  als   meine  letzte  Existenz  nur  reicht.     Mein \r\n\r\n\r\n376  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nAuge  bildet  sich  unglaublich,  und  meine  Hand  soll  nicht \r\nganz  zurückbleiben.  Es  ist  nur  ei7i  Rom  in  der  Welt,  und \r\nich  befinde  mich  hier  wie  der  Fisch  im  Wasser  und \r\nschwimme  oben  wie  eine  Stiickkugel  im  Quecksilber,  die \r\nin  jedem  andern  Fluidum  untergeht.  Nichts  trübt  die \r\nAtmosphäre  meiner  Gedanken,  als  daß  ich  mein  Glück \r\nnicht  mit  meinen  Geliebten  teilen  kann.  Der  Himmel  ist \r\njetzt  herrlich  heiter,  so  daß  Rom  nur  morgens  und  abends \r\neinigen  Nebel  hat.  Auf  den  Gebirgen  aber,  Albano, \r\nCastello,  Frascati,  wo  ich  vergangene  Woche  drei  Tage \r\nzubrachte,  ist  eine  immer  heitre  reine  Luft.  Da  ist  eine \r\nNatur  zu  studieren. \r\n\r\nBemerkung \r\nIndem  ich  nun  meine  Mitteilungen  den  damaligen  Zu- \r\nständen, Eindrücken  und  Gefühlen  gemäß  einrichten \r\nmöchte  und  daher  aus  eigenen  Briefen,  welche  freilich \r\nmehr  als  irgend  eine  spätere  Erzählung  das  Eigentümliche \r\ndes  Augenblicks  darstellen,  die  allgemein  interessanten \r\nStellen  auszuziehen  anfange,  so  find  ich  auch  Freundes- \r\nbriefe mir  unter  der  Hand,  welche  hiezu  noch  vorzüg- \r\nlicher dienen  möchten.  Deshalb  ich  denn  solche  briefliche \r\nDokumente  hie  und  da  einzuschalten  mich  entschließe  und \r\nhier  sogleich  damit  beginne,  von  dem  aus  Rom  scheiden- \r\nden, in  Neapel  anlangenden  Tischbein  die  lebhaftesten \r\nErzählungen  einzuführen.  Sie  gewähren  den  Vorteil,  den \r\nLeser  sogleich  in  jene  Gegenden  und  in  die  unmittel- \r\nbarsten Verhältnisse  der  Personen  zu  versetzen,  beson- \r\nders auch  den  Charakter  des  Künstlers  aufzuklären,  der \r\nso  lange  bedeutend  gewirkt  und,  wenn  er  auch  mitunter \r\ngar  wunderlich  erscheinen  mochte,  doch  immer  so  in \r\nseinem  Bestreben  als  in  seinem  Leisten  ein  dankbares \r\nErinnern  verdient. \r\n\r\nTischbein  a/i  Goethe \r\n\r\nNeapel,  den  ro.  Juli  i'j'^'j- \r\nUnsere  Reise  von  Rom  bis  Capua  war  selir  glücklich  und \r\nangenehm.    In  Albano  kam  Ilackert  zu  uns;   in  Velletri \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  377 \r\n\r\nspeisten  wir  bei  Kardinal  Borgia  und  besahen  dessen \r\nMuseum,  zu  meinem  besondern  Vergnügen,  weil  ich \r\nmanches  bemerkte,  das  ich  im  ersten  Mal  übergangen  hatte. \r\nUm  drei  Uhr  nachmittags  reisten  wir  wieder  ab,  durch \r\ndie  Pontinischen  Sümpfe,  die  mir  dieses  Mal  auch  viel \r\nbesser  gefielen  als  im  Winter,  weil  die  grünen  Bäume  und \r\nHecken  diesen  großen  Ebenen  eine  anmutige  Verschieden- \r\nheit geben.  Wir  fanden  uns  kurz  vor  der  Abenddämme- \r\nrung in  Mitte  der  Sümpfe,  wo  die  Post  wechselt.  Während \r\nder  Zeit  aber,  als  die  Postillons  alle  Beredsamkeit  an- \r\nwendeten, uns  Geld  abzunötigen,  fand  ein  mutiger  Schim- \r\nmelhengst Gelegenheit,  sich  loszureißen  und  fortzurennen; \r\ndas  gab  ein  Schauspiel,  welches  uns  viel  Vergnügen \r\nmachte.  Es  war  ein  schneeweißes  schönes  Pferd  von \r\nprächtiger  Gestalt;  er  zerriß  die  Zügel,  womit  er  ange- \r\nbunden war,  hackte  mit  den  Vorderfüßen  nach  dem,  der \r\nihn  aufhalten  wollte,  schlug  hinten  aus  und  machte  ein \r\nsolches  Geschrei  mit  Wiehern,  daß  alles  aus  Furcht  bei- \r\nseite trat.  Nun  sprang  er  übern  Graben  und  galoppierte \r\nüber  das  Feld,  beständig  schnaubend  und  wiehernd. \r\nSchweif  und  Mähnen  flatterten  hoch  in  die  Luft  auf,  und \r\nseine  Gestalt  in  freier  Bewegung  war  so  schön,  daß  alles \r\nausrief:  o  che  bellezze!  che  bellezze!  Dann  lief  er  nah  an \r\neinem  andern  Graben  hin  und  wider  und  suchte  eine \r\nschmale  Stelle,  um  überzuspringen  und  zu  den  Fohlen \r\nund  Stuten  zu  kommen,  deren  viele  Hundert  jenseits \r\nweideten.  Endlich  gelang  es  ihm,  hinüberzuspringen,  und \r\nnun  setzte  er  unter  die  Stuten,  die  ruhig  graseten.  Die \r\nerschraken  vor  seiner  Wildheit  und  seinem  Geschrei, \r\nliefen  in  langer  Reihe  und  flohen  über  das  flache  Feld \r\nvor  ihm  hin;  er  aber  immer  hinterdrein,  indem  er  aufzu- \r\nspringen versuchte. \r\n\r\nEndlich  trieb  er  eine  Stute  abseits;  die  eilte  nun  auf  ein \r\nander  Feld  zu  einer  andern  zahlreichen  Versammlung  von \r\nStuten.  Auch  diese,  von  Schrecken  ergrifien,  schlugen \r\nhinüber  zu  dem  ersten  Haufen.  Nun  war  das  Feld  schwarz \r\nvon  Pferden,  wo  der  weiße  Hengst  immer  drunter  her- \r\numsprang, alles  in  Schrecken  und  Wildheit.  Die  Herde \r\nlief  in  langen  Reihen  auf  dem  Felde  hin  und  her,  es  sauste \r\n\r\n\r\n378  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\ndie  Luft  und  donnerte  die  Erde,  wo  die  Kraft  der  schweren \r\nPferde  überhinflog.  Wir  sahen  lange  mit  Vergnügen  zu, \r\nwie  der  Trupp  von  so  vielen  Hunderten  auf  dem  Feld \r\nherumgaloppierte,  bald  in  einem  Klump,  bald  geteilt, \r\njetzt  zerstreut  einzeln  umherlaufend,  bald  in  langen  Reihen \r\nüber  den  Boden  hinrennend. \r\n\r\nEndlich  beraubte  uns  die  Dunkelheit  der  einbrechenden \r\nNacht  dieses  einzigen  Schauspiels,  und  als  der  klarste \r\nMond  hinter  den  Bergen  aufstieg,  verlosch  das  Licht \r\nunsrer  angezündeten  Laternen.  Doch  da  ich  mich  lange \r\nan  seinem  sanften  Schein  vergnügt  hatte,  konnte  ich  mich \r\ndes  Schlafs  nicht  mehr  erwehren,  und  mit  aller  Furcht \r\nvor  der  ungesunden  Luft  schlief  ich  länger  als  eine  Stunde \r\nund  erwachte  nicht  eher,  bis  wir  zu  Terracina  ankamen, \r\nwo  wir  die  Pferde  wechselten. \r\n\r\nliier  waren  die  Postillons  sehr  artig,  wegen  der  Furcht, \r\nwelche  ihnen  der  Marchese  Lucchesini  eingejagt  hatte; \r\nsie  gaben  uns  die  besten  Pferde  und  Führer,  weil  der \r\nWeg  zwischen  den  großen  Klippen  und  dem  Meer  ge- \r\nfährlich ist.  Hier  sind  schon  manche  Unglücke  geschehen, \r\nbesonders  nachts,  wo  die  Pferde  leicht  scheu  werden. \r\nWährend  des  Anspannens,  und  indessen  man  den  Paß \r\nan  die  letzte  römische  Wache  vorzeigte,  ging  ich  zwischen \r\nden  hohen  Felsen  und  dem  Meer  spazieren  und  erblickte \r\nden  größten  Effekt:  der  dunkle  Fels,  vom  Mond  glänzend \r\nerleuchtet,  der  eine  lebhaft  flimmernde  Säule  in  das  blaue \r\nMeer  warf  und  bis  auf  die  am  Ufer  schwankenden  Wellen \r\nheranflimmerte. \r\n\r\nDa  oben,  auf  der  Zinne  des  Berges,  im  dämmernden  Blau, \r\nlagen  die  Trümmer  von  Genserichs  zerfallener  Burg;  sie \r\nmachte  mich  an  vergangene  Zeiten  denken:  ich  fühlte \r\ndes  unglücklichen  Konradins  Sehnsucht,  sich  zu  retten, \r\nwie  des  Cicero  und  des  Marius,  die  sich  alle  in  dieser \r\nGegend  geängstigt  hatten. \r\n\r\n•  Schön  war  es,  nun  fernerhin  an  dem  Berg,  zwischen  den \r\ngroßen  herabgerollten  Felsenkhunpen  am  Saume  des  Meers \r\nim  Mondenlicht  herzufahren.  Deutlich  beleuchtet  waren \r\ndie  Gruppen  der  ülivenbäume,  Palmen  und  Pinien  bei \r\nFondi;   aber  die  Vorzüge  der  Zitronenwälder  vermißte \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  379 \r\n\r\nman;  sie  stehen  nur  in  ihrer  ganzen  Pracht,  wenn  die \r\nSonne  auf  die  goldglänzenden  Früchte  scheint.  Nun  ging \r\nes  über  den  Berg,  wo  die  vielen  Oliven-  und  Johannis- \r\nbrotbäume stehen,  und  es  war  schon  Tag  geworden,  als \r\nwir  bei  den  Ruinen  der  antiken  Stadt,  wo  die  vielen  Über- \r\nbleibsel von  Grabmälern  sind,  ankamen.  Das  größte  dar- \r\nunter soll  dem  Cicero  errichtet  worden  sein,  eben  an  dem \r\nOrt,  wo  er  ermordet  worden.  Es  war  schon  einige  Stunden \r\nTag,  als  wir  an  den  erfreulichen  Meerbusen  zu  Mola  di \r\nGaeta  ankamen.  Die  Fischer  mit  ihrer  Beute  kehrten \r\nschon  wieder  zurück,  das  machte  den  Strand  sehr  lebhaft. \r\nEinige  trugen  die  Fische  und  Meerfrüchte  in  Körben  weg, \r\ndie  andern  bereiteten  die  Garne  schon  wieder  auf  einen \r\nkünftigen  Fang.  Von  da  fuhren  wir  nach  Garigliano,  wo \r\nCavaliere  Venuti  graben  läßt.  Hier  verließ  uns  Hackert, \r\ndenn  er  eilte  nach  Caserta,  und  wir  gingen,  abwärts \r\nvon  der  Straße,  herunter  an  das  Meer,  wo  ein  Frühstück \r\nfür  uns  bereitet  war,  welches  wohl  für  ein  Mittagsessen \r\ngelten  konnte.  Hier  waren  die  ausgegrabenen  Antiken \r\naufgehoben,  die  aber  jämmerlich  zerschlagen  sind.  Unter \r\nandern  schönen  Sachen  findet  sich  ein  Bein  von  einer \r\nStatue,  die  dem  Apoll  von  Belvedere  nicht  viel  nach- \r\ngeben mag.  Es  war  ein  Glück,  wenn  man  das'  übrige \r\ndazu  fände. \r\n\r\nWir  hatten  uns  aus  Müdigkeit  etwas  schlafen  gelegt,  und \r\nda  wir  wieder  erwachten,  fanden  wir  uns  in  Gesellschaft \r\neiner  angenehmen  Familie,  die  in  dieser  Gegend  wohnt \r\nund  hierher  gekommen  war,  um  uns  ein  Mittagsmahl  zu \r\ngeben;  welche  Aufmerksamkeit  wir  freilich  Herrn  Hackert \r\nschuldig  sein  mochten,  der  sich  aber  schon  entfernt  hatte. \r\nEs  stand  also  wieder  aufs  neue  ein  Tisch  bereitet;  ich \r\naber  konnte  nicht  essen  noch  sitzen  bleiben,  so  gut  auch \r\ndie  Gesellschaft  war,  sondern  ging  am  Meer  spazieren \r\nzwischen  den  Steinen,  worunter  sich  sehr  wunderliche \r\nbefanden,  besonders  viele  durch  Meerinsekten  durch- \r\nlöchert, deren  einige  aussahen  wie  ein  Schwamm. \r\nHier  begegnete  mir  auch  etwas  recht  Vergnügliches.  Ein \r\nZiegenhirt  trieb  an  den  Strand  des  Meeres;  die  Ziegen \r\nkamen  in  das  Wasser  und  kühlten  sich  ab.     Nun  kam \r\n\r\n\r\n38o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nauch  der  Schweinehirt  dazu,  und  unter  der  Zeit,  daß  die \r\nbeiden  Herden  sich  in  den  Wellen  erfrischten,  setzten \r\nsich  beide  Hirten  in  den  Schatten  und  machten  Musik: \r\nder  Schweinehirt  auf  einer  Flöte,  der  Ziegenhirt  auf  dem \r\nDudelsack.  Endlich  ritt  ein  erwachsener  Knabe  nackend \r\nheran  und  ging  so  tief  in  das  Wasser,  so  tief,  daß  das \r\nPferd  mit  ihm  schwamm.  Das  sah  nun  gar  schön  aus, \r\nwenn  der  wohlgewachsene  Junge  so  nah  ans  Ufer  kam, \r\ndaß  man  seine  ganze  Gestalt  sah,  und  er  sodann  wieder \r\nin  das  tiefe  Meer  zurückkehrte,  wo  man  nichts  weiter  sah \r\nals  den  Kopf  des  schwimmenden  Pferdes,  ihn  aber  bis  an \r\ndie  Schultern. \r\n\r\nUm  drei  Uhr  nachmittags  fuhren  wir  weiter,  und  als  wir \r\nCapua  drei  Meilen  hinter  uns  gelassen  hatten — es  war \r\nschon  eine  Stunde  in  der  Nacht  — zerbrachen  wir  das \r\nHinterrad  unsres  Wagens.  Das  hielt  uns  einige  Stunden \r\nauf,  um  ein  andres  an  die  Stelle  zu  nehmen.  Da  aber \r\ndieses  geschehen  war  und  wir  abermals  einige  Meilen \r\nzurückgelegt  hatten,  brach  die  Achse.  Hierüber  wurden \r\nwir  sehr  verdrießlich;  wir  waren  so  nah  bei  Neapel  und \r\nkonnten  doch  unsre  Freunde  nicht  sprechen.  Endlich \r\nlangten  wir  einige  Stunden  nach  Mitternacht  daselbst  an, \r\nwo  wir  noch  so  viele  Menschen  auf  der  Straße  fanden, \r\nals  man  in  einer  andern  Stadt  kaum  um  Mittag  findet. \r\nHier  hab  ich  nun  alle  unsre  Freunde  gesund  und  wohl \r\nangetroffen,  die  sich  alle  freuten,  dasselbe  von  Ihnen  zu \r\nhören.  Ich  wohne  bei  Herrn  Hackert  im  Hause;  vor- \r\ngestern war  ich  mit  Ritter  Hamilton  zuPosilipo  auf  seinem \r\nLusthause.  Da  kann  man  denn  freilich  nichts  Herrlicheres \r\nauf  Gottes  Erdboden  schauen.  Nach  Tische  schwammen \r\nein  Dutzend  Jungen  in  dem  Meere,  das  war  schön  anzu- \r\nsehen. Die  vielen  Gruppen  und  Stellungen,  welche  sie \r\nin  ihren  Spielen  machten!  er  bezahlt  sie  dafür,  damit  er \r\njeden  Nachmittag  diese  Lust  habe.  Hamilton  gefällt  mir \r\naußerordentlich  wohl;  ich  sprach  vieles  mit  ihm,  sowohl \r\nhier  im  Haus,  als  auch  da  wir  auf  dem  Meer  spazieren \r\nfuhren.  Es  freute  mich  außerordentlich,  so  viel  von  ihm \r\nzu  erfahren,  und  hoffe  noch  viel  Gutes  von  diesem  Manne. \r\nSchreiben  Sie  mir  doch  die  Namen  Ihrer  übrigen  hiesigen \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  381 \r\n\r\nFreunde,  damit  ich  auch  sie  kennen  lernen  und  grüßen \r\nkann.  Bald  sollen  Sie  mehreres  von  hier  vernehmen. \r\nGrüßen  Sie  alle  Freunde,  besonders  Angelica  und  Reißen- \r\nstein. \r\n\r\nN.S.  Ich  finde  es  in  Neapel  sehr  viel  heißer  als  in  Rom, \r\nnur  mit  dem  Unterschied,  daß  die  Luft  gesünder  ist  und \r\nauch  beständig  etwas  frischer  Wind  weht,  aber  die  Sonne \r\nhat  viel  mehr  Kraft;  die  ersten  Tage  war  es  mir  fast \r\nunerträglich.  Ich  habe  bloß  von  Eis  und  Schneewasser \r\ngelebt. \r\n\r\nSpäter^  ohne  Datum. \r\nGestern  hätt  ich  Sie  in  Neapel  gewünscht:  einen  solchen \r\nLärmen,  eine  solche  Volksmenge,  die  nur  da  war,  um \r\nEßwaren  einzukaufen,  hab  ich  in  meinem  Leben  nicht \r\ngesehen;  aber  auch  so  viele  dieser  Eßwaren  sieht  man \r\nnie  wieder  beisammen.  Von  allen  Sorten  war  die  große \r\nStraße  Toledo  fast  bedeckt.  Hier  bekommt  man  erst  eine \r\nIdee  von  einem  Volk,  das  in  einer  so  glücklichen  Gegend \r\nwohnt,  wo  die  Jahrszeit  täglich  Früchte  wachsen  läßt. \r\nDenken  Sie  sich,  daß  heute  500000  Menschen  im \r\nSchmausen  begriffen  sind,  und  das  auf  Neapolitaner  Art. \r\nGestern  und  heute  war  ich  an  einer  Tafel,  wo  gefressen \r\nist  worden,  daß  ich  erstaunt  bin;  ein  sündiger  Überfluß \r\nwar  da.  Kniep  saß  auch  dabei  und  übernahm  sich  so \r\nvon  allen  den  leckern  Speisen  zu  essen,  daß  ich  fürchtete, \r\ner  platze;  aber  ihn  rührte  es  nicht,  und  er  erzählte  dabei \r\nimmer  von  dem  Appetit,  den  er  auf  dem  Schiff  und  in \r\nSizilien  gehabt  habe,  indessen  Sie  für  Ihr  gutes  Geld  teils \r\naus  Übelbefinden,  teils  aus  Vorsatz  gefastet  und  so  gut \r\nals  gehungert. \r\n\r\nHeute  ist  schon  alles  aufgefressen  worden,  was  gestern \r\nverkauft  wurde,  und  man  sagt,  morgen  sei  die  Straße \r\nwieder  so  voll,  als  sie  gestern  war.  Toledo  scheint  ein \r\nTheater,  wo  man  den  Überfluß  zeigen  will.  Die  Buti- \r\nken  sind  alle  ausgeziert  mit  Eßwaren,  die  sogar  über \r\ndie  Straße  in  Girlanden  hinüberhängen,  die  Würstchen \r\nzum  Teil  vergoldet  und  mit  roten  Bändern  gebunden;  die \r\nwelschen  Hahnen  haben  alle  eine  rote  Fahne  im  Hintern \r\n\r\n\r\n382  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nstecken;  deren  sind  gestern  dreißigtausend  verkauft  wor- \r\nden; dazu  rechne  man  die,  welche  die  Leute  im  Hause \r\nfett  machen.  Die  Zahl  der  Esel,  mit  Kapaunen  beladen, \r\nsowie  der  andern,  mit  kleinen  Pomeranzen  belastet,  die \r\ngroßen  auf  dem  Pflaster  aufgeschütteten  Haufen  solcher \r\nGoldfrüchte  erschreckten  einen.  Aber  am  schönsten \r\nmöchten  doch  die  Butiken  sein,  wo  grüne  Sachen  ver- \r\nkauft werden,  und  die,  wo  Rosinentrauben,  Feigen  und \r\nMelonen  aufgesetzt  sind:  alles  so  zierlich  zur  Schau  ge- \r\nordnet, daß  es  Auge  und  Herz  erfreut.  Neapel  ist  ein \r\nOrt,  wo  Gott  häufig  seinen  Segen  gibt  für  alle  Sinne. \r\n\r\nSpater,  o/iiie  Datum. \r\nHier  haben  Sie  eine  Zeichnung  von  den  Türken,  die  hier \r\ngefangen  liegen.  Der  Herkules,  wie  es  erst  hieß,  hat  sie \r\nnicht  genommen,  sondern  ein  Schiff,  welches  die  Ko- \r\nrallenfischer begleitete.  Die  Türken  sahen  dieses  christ- \r\nliche Fahrzeug  und  machten  sich  dran,  um  es  wegzu- \r\nnehmen, aber  sie  fanden  sich  betrogen;  denn  die  Cliristen \r\nwaren  stärker,  und  so  wurden  sie  überwältigt  und  ge- \r\nfangen hierher  geführt.  Es  waren  dreißig  Mann  auf  dem \r\nchristlichen  Schifte,  vierundzwanzig  auf  dem  türkischen; \r\nsechs  Türken  blieben  im  Gefechte,  einer  ist  verwundet; \r\nvon  den  Christen  ist  kein  einziger  geblieben,  die  Madonna \r\nhat  sie  beschützt. \r\n\r\nDer  Schifl;er  hat  eine  große  Beute  gemacht;  er  fand  sehr \r\nviel  Geld  und  Waren,  Seidenzeug  und  Kaftee,  auch  einen \r\nreichen  Schmuck,  welcher  einer  jungen  Mohrin  gehörte. \r\nEs  war  merkwürdig,  die  vielen  tausend  Menschen  zu \r\nsehen,  welche  Kahn  an  Kahn  dahinfuhren,  um  die  Ge- \r\nfangenen zu  beschauen,  besonders  die  Mohrin.  Es  fanden \r\nsich  verschiedene  Liebhaber,  die  sie  kaufen  wollten  und \r\nviel  Geld  boten,  aber  der  Kapitän  will  sie  nicht  weg- \r\ngeben. \r\n\r\nIch  fuhr  alle  Tage  hin  und  fand  einmal  den  Ritter  Ha- \r\nmilton und  Miß  Harte,  die  sehr  gerührt  war  und  weinte. \r\nDa  das  die  Mohrin  sah,  fing  sie  auch  an,  zu  weinen;  die \r\nMiß  wollte  sie  kaufen,  der  Kapitän  aber  hartnäckig  sie \r\n\r\n\r\nROM17S7  3«3 \r\n\r\nnicht  hergeben.  Jetzo  sind  sie  nicht  mehr  hier;  die  Zeich- \r\nnunsr  besaa:t  das  weitere. \r\n\r\n\r\nN'ac/itr(7g.    Päpstliche  7'cppiche \r\n\r\nDie  große  Aufopferung,  zu  der  ich  mich  entschloß,  eine \r\nvon  dem  Gipfel  des  Bergs  bis  beinahe  ans  Meer  herab- \r\nströmende Lava  hinter  mir  zu  lassen,  ward  mir  durch \r\nden  erreichten  Zweck  reichlich  vergolten,  durch  den  An- \r\nblick der  Teppiche,  welche,  am  Fronleichnamstag  auf- \r\ngehängt, uns  an  Rafiael,  seine  Schüler,  seine  Zeit  auf  das \r\nglänzendste  erinnerten. \r\n\r\nIn  den  Niederlanden  hatte  das  Teppichwirken  mit  ste- \r\nhendem Zettel,  Hautelisse  genannt,  sich  schon  auf  den \r\nhöchsten  Grad  erhoben.  Es  ist  mir  nicht  bekannt  ge- \r\nworden, wie  sich  nach  und  nach  die  Fertigung  der  Tep- \r\npiche entwickelt  und  gesteigert  hat.  In  dem  zwölften \r\nJahrhundert  mag  man  noch  die  einzelnen  Figuren  durch \r\nStickerei  oder  auf  sonst  eine  Weise  fertig  gemacht  und \r\nsodann  durch  besonders  gearbeitete  Zwischenstücke  zu- \r\nsammengesetzt haben.  Dergleichen  finden  wir  noch  über \r\nden  Chorstühlen  alter  Domkirchen,  und  hat  die  Arbeit \r\netwas  Ähnliches  mit  den  bunten  Fensterscheiben,  welche \r\nauch  zuerst  aus  ganz  kleinen  farbigen  Glasstückchen  ihre \r\nBilder  zusammengesetzt  haben.  Bei  den  Teppichen  ver- \r\ntrat Nadel  und  Faden  das  Lot  und  die  Zinnstäbchen. \r\nAlle  frühen  Anfänge  der  Kunst  imd  Technik  sind  von \r\ndieser  Art;  wir  haben  kostbare  chinesische  Teppiche,  auf \r\ngleiche  Weise  gefertigt,  vor  Augen  gehabt. \r\nWahrscheinlich  durch  orientalische  Muster  veranlaßt, \r\nhatte  man  in  den  handeis-  und  prachtreichen  Nieder- \r\nlanden zu  Anfang  des  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  diese \r\nkunstreiche  Technik  schon  aufs  höchste  getrieben;  der- \r\ngleichen Arbeiten  gingen  schon  wieder  nach  dem  Orient \r\nzurück  und  waren  gewiß  auch  in  Rom  bekannt,  wahr- \r\nscheinlich nach  unvollkommenen,  in  byzantinischem  Sinne \r\ngemodelten  Mustern  und  Zeichnungen.  Der  große  und \r\nin  manchem,  besonders  auch  ästhetischem  Sinn  freie  Geist \r\nLeo  X.  mochte  nun  auch,  was  er  auf  Wänden  abgebildet \r\n\r\n\r\n384  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nsah,  gleichmäßig  frei  und  groß  in  seiner  Umgebung  auf \r\nTeppichen  erblicken,  und  auf  seine  Veranlassung  fertigte \r\nRaffael  die  Kartone :  glücklicherweise  solche  Gegenstände, \r\nwelche  Christi  Bezug  zu  seinen  Aposteln,  sodann  aber  die \r\nWirkungen  solcher  begabten  Männer  nach  dem  Heim- \r\ngange des  Meisters  vorstellten. \r\n\r\nAm  Fronleichnamstage  nun  lernte  man  erst  die  wahre \r\nBestimmung  der  Teppiche  kennen  :  hier  machten  sie  Ko- \r\nlonnaden und  offene  Räume  zu  prächtigen  Sälen  und \r\nWandelgängen,  und  zwar  indem  sie  das  Vermögen  des \r\nbegabtesten  Mannes  uns  entschieden  vor  Augen  stellen \r\nund  uns  das  glücklichste  Beispiel  geben,  wo  Kunst  und \r\nHandwerk  in  beiderseitiger  Vollendung  sich  auf  ihrem \r\nhöchsten  Punkte  lebendig  begegnen. \r\nDie  Raftaelischen  Kartone,  wie  sie  bis  jetzt  in  England \r\nverwahrt  sind,  bleiben  noch  immer  die  Bewunderung  der \r\nWelt:  einige  rühren  gewiß  von  dem  Meister  allein  her, \r\nandere  mögen  nach  seinen  Zeichnungen,  seiner  Angabe, \r\nandere  sogar  erst,  nachdem  er  abgeschieden  war,  gefer- \r\ntigt sein.  Alles  bezeugte  große  übereintreffende  Kunst- \r\nbestimmung, und  die  Künstler  aller  Nationen  strömten \r\nhier  zusammen,  um  ihren  Geist  zu  erheben  und  ihre \r\nFähigkeiten  zu  steigern. \r\n\r\nDies  gibt  uns  Veranlassung,  über  die  Tendenz  der  deut- \r\nschen Künstler  zu  denken,  welche  Hochschätzung  und \r\nNeigung  gegen  seine  ersten  Werke  hinzog  und  wovon \r\nschon  damals  leise  Spuren  sich  bemerken  ließen. \r\nMit  einem  talentreichen  zarten  Jüngling,  der  im  Sanften, \r\nAnmutigen,  Natürlichen  verweilt,  fühlt  man  sich  in  jeder \r\nKunst  näher  verwandt;  man  wagt  es  zwar  nicht,  sich  mit \r\nihm  zu  vergleichen,  doch  im  stillen  mit  ihm  zu  wetteifern, \r\nvon  sich  zu  hoffen,  was  er  geleistet  hat. \r\nNicht  mit  gleichem  Behagen  wenden  wir  uns  an  den \r\nvollendeten  Mann;  denn  wir  ahnen  die  furchtbaren  Be- \r\ndingungen, unter  welchen  allein  sich  selbst  das  entschie- \r\ndenste Naturell  zum  Letztmöglichen  des  Gelingens  er- \r\nheben kann,  und  wollen  wir  nicht  verzweifeln,  so  müssen \r\nwir  uns  zurückwenden  und  uns  mit  dem  Strebenden,  dem \r\nWerdenden  vergleichen. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  385 \r\n\r\nDies  ist  die  Ursache,  warum  die  deutschen  Künstler  Nei- \r\ngung, Verehrung,  Zutrauen  zu  dem  Älteren,  Unvollkom- \r\nmenen wendeten,  weil  sie  sich  daneben  auch  für  etwas \r\nhalten  konnten  und  sich  mit  der  Hoffnung  schmeicheln \r\ndurften,  das  in  ihrer  Person  zu  leisten,  wozu  dennoch \r\neine  Folge  von  Jahrhunderten  erforderlich  gewesen. \r\nKehren  wir  zu  Rafiaeis  Kartonen  zurück  und  sprechen \r\naus,  daß  sie  alle  männlich  gedacht  sind:  sittlicher  Ernst, \r\nahnungsvolle  Größe  walten  überall,  und,  obgleich  hie \r\nund  da  geheimnisvoll,  werden  sie  doch  denjenigen  durch- \r\naus klar,  welche  von  dem  Abschiede  des  Erlösers  und  den \r\nwundervollen  Gaben,  die  er  seinen  Jüngern  hinterließ, \r\naus  den  heiligen  Schriften  genugsam  unterrichtet  sind. \r\nNehmen  wir  vor  allen  die  Beschämung  und  Bestrafung \r\ndes  Ananias  vor  Augen,  da  uns  denn  jederzeit  der  kleine, \r\ndem  Marc-Anton  nicht  unbillig  zugeschriebene  Kupfer- \r\nstich, nach  einer  ausführlichen  Zeichnung  Raftaels,  die \r\nNachbildung  der  Kartone  von  Dorigny  und  die  Ver- \r\ngleichung  beider  hinlänglichen  Dienst  leisten. \r\nWenig  Kompositionen  wird  man  dieser  an  die  Seite  setzen \r\nkönnen;  hier  ist  ein  großer  Begriff,  eine  in  ihrer  Eigen- \r\ntümlichkeit höchst  wichtige  Handlung  in  ihrer  vollkom- \r\nmensten Mannigfaltigkeit  auf  das  klarste  dargestellt. \r\nDie  Apostel,  als  fromme  Gabe  das  Eigentum  eines  jeden \r\nin  den  allgemeinen  Besitz  dargebracht  erwartend;  die \r\nheranbringenden  Gläubigen  auf  der  einen,  die  empfan- \r\ngenden Dürftigen  auf  der  andern  Seite,  und  in  der  Mitte \r\nder  Defraudierende,  gräßlich  bestraft:  eine  Anordnung, \r\nderen  Symmetrie  aus  dem  Gegebenen  hervorgeht  und \r\nwelche  wieder  durch  die  Erfordernisse  des  Darzustellen- \r\nden nicht  sowohl  verborgen  als  belebt  wird;  wie  ja  die \r\nunerläßliche  symmetrische  Proportion  des  menschlichen \r\nKörpers  erst  durch  mannigfaltige  Lebensbewegung  ein- \r\ndringliches Interesse  gewinnt. \r\n\r\nWenn  nun  bei  Anschauung  dieses  Kunstwerkes  der  Be- \r\nmerkungen kein  Ende  sein  würde,  so  wollen  wir  hier  nur \r\nnoch  ein  wichtiges  Verdienst  dieser  Darstellung  auszeich- \r\nnen. Zwei  männliche  Personen,  welche  herankommend \r\nzusammengepackte  Kleidungsstücke  tragen,  gehören  not- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  25 \r\n\r\n\r\n386  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nwendig  zu  Ananias;  aber  wie  will  man  hieraus  erkennen, \r\ndaß  ein  Teil  davon  zurückgeblieben  und  dem  Gemeingut \r\nunterschlagen  worden?  Hier  werden  wir  aber  auf  eine \r\njunge  hübsche  Weibsperson  aufmerksam  gemacht,  welche \r\nmit  einem  heitern  Gesichte  aus  der  rechten  Hand  Geld \r\nin  die  linke  zählt;  und  sogleich  erinnern  wir  uns  an  das \r\nedle  Wort:  'Die  Linke  soll  nicht  wissen,  was  die  Rechte \r\ngibt',  und  zweifeln  nicht,  daß  hier  Saphira  gemeint  sei, \r\nwelche  das  den  Aposteln  einzureichende  Geld  abzählt, \r\num  noch  einiges  zurückzubehalten,  welches  ihre  heiter \r\nlistige  Miene  anzudeuten  scheint.  Dieser  Gedanke  ist \r\nerstaunenswürdig  und  furchtbar,  wenn  man  sich  ihm  hin- \r\ngibt. Vor  uns  der  Gatte,  schon  verrenkt  und  bestraft, \r\nam  Boden  in  gräßlicher  Zuckung  sich  windend;  wenig \r\nhinterwärts,  das  Vorgehende  nicht  gewahr  werdend,  die \r\nGattin,  sicher  arglistig  sinnend,  die  Göttlichen  zu  bevor- \r\nteilen,  ohne  Ahnung,  welchem  Schicksal  sie  entgegengeht. \r\nÜberhaupt  steht  dieses  Bild  als  ein  ewiges  Problem  vor \r\nuns  da,  welches  wir  immer  mehr  bewundern,  je  mehr \r\nuns  dessen  Auflösung  möglich  und  klar  wird.  Die  Ver- \r\ngleichung  des  Marc-Antonischen  Kupfers  nach  einer \r\ngleich  großen  Zeichnung  Raftaels  und  des  größeren  von \r\nDorigny  nach  dem  Karton  führt  uns  abermals  in  die \r\nTiefe  der  Betrachtung,  mit  welcher  Weisheit  ein  solches \r\nTalent  bei  einer  zweiten  Behandlung  derselben  Kom- \r\nposition Veränderungen  und  Steigerungen  zu  bewirken \r\ngewußt  hat.  Bekennen  wir  gern,  daß  ein  solches  Stu- \r\ndium uns  zu  den  schönsten  Freuden  eines  langen  Lebens \r\ngedient  hat. \r\n\r\nJuli \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  5.  Juli. \r\nMein  jetziges  Leben  sieht  einem  Jugendtraume  völlig \r\nähnlich;  wir  wollen  sehen,  ob  ich  bestimmt  bin,  ihn  zu \r\ngenießen  oder  zu  erfahren,  daß  auch  dieses,  wie  so  vieles \r\nandre,  nur  eitel  ist.  Tischbein  ist  fort,  sein  Studium  auf- \r\ngeräumt, ausgestäubt  und  ausgewaschen,  so  daß  ich  nun \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  3S7 \r\n\r\ngerne  drin  sein  mag.  Wie  nötig  ists,  in  der  jetzigen  Zeit \r\nein  angenehmes  Zuhause  zu  haben!  Die  Hitze  ist  ge- \r\nwaltig. Morgens  mit  Sonnenaufgang  steh  ich  auf  und \r\ngehe  nach  der  Acqua  acetosa,  einem  Sauerbrunnen,  ohn- \r\ngefähr  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  dem  Tor,  an  dem  ich \r\nwohne,  trinke  das  Wasser,  das  wie  ein  schwacher  Schwal- \r\nbacher  schmeckt,  in  diesem  Klima  aber  schon  sehr  wirk- \r\nsam ist.  Gegen  acht  Uhr  bin  ich  wieder  zu  Hause  und \r\nbin  fleißig  auf  alle  Weise,  wie  es  die  Stimmung  nur  geben \r\nwill.  Ich  bin  recht  wohl.  Die  Hitze  schafft  alles  Fluß- \r\nartige weg  und  treibt,  was  Schärfe  im  Körper  ist,  nach \r\nder  Haut,  und  es  ist  besser,  daß  ein  Übel  juckt,  als  daß \r\nes  reißt  und  zieht.  Im  Zeichnen  fahr  ich  fort,  Geschmack \r\nund  Hand  zu  bilden;  ich  habe  Architektur  angefangen \r\nernstlicher  zu  treiben,  es  wird  mir  alles  erstaunend  leicht, \r\ndas  heißt  der  Begriff;  denn  die  Ausübung  erfordert  ein \r\nLeben.  Was  das  Beste  war:  ich  hatte  keinen  Eigendünkel \r\nund  keine  Prätension;  ich  hatte  nichts  zu  verlangen,  als \r\nich  herkam.  Und  nun  dringe  ich  nur  drauf,  daß  mir \r\nnichts  Name,  nichts  Wort  bleibe.  Was  schön,  groß,  ehr- \r\nwürdig gehalten  wird,  will  ich  mit  eignen  Augen  sehn \r\nund  erkennen.  Ohne  Nachahmung  ist  dies  nicht  möglich. \r\nNun  muß  ich  mich  an  die  Gipsköpfe  setzen.  (Die  rechte \r\nMethode  wird  mir  von  Künstlern  angedeutet.  Ich  halte \r\nmich  zusammen,  was  möglich  ist.)  Am  x\\nfang  der  Woche \r\nkönnt  ichs  nicht  absagen,  hier  und  da  zu  essen.  Nun \r\nwollen  sie  mich  hier-  und  dahin  haben;  ich  lasse  es  vor- \r\nübergehn  und  bleibe  in  meiner  Stille.  Moritz,  einige \r\nLandsleute  im  Hause,  ein  wackerer  Schweizer  sind  mein \r\ngewöhnlicher  Umgang.  Zu  Angelica  und  Rat  Reiffen- \r\nstein  geh  ich  auch:  überall  mit  meiner  nachdenklichen \r\nArt,  und  niemand  ist,  dem  ich  mich  eröflnete.  Lucchesini \r\nist  wieder  hier,  der  alle  Welt  sieht  und  den  man  sieht \r\nwie  alle  Welt.  Ein  Mann,  der  sein  Metier  recht  macht, \r\nwenn  ich  mich  nicht  sehr  irre.  Nächstens  schreib  ich  dir \r\nvon  einigen  Personen,  die  ich  bald  zu  kennen  hoö'e. \r\nEgmont  ist  in  der  Arbeit,  und  ich  hofte,  er  wird  geraten. \r\nWenigstens  hab  ich  immer  unter  dem  Machen  Sym- \r\nptome gehabt,  die  mich  nicht  betrogen  haben.     Es  ist \r\n\r\n\r\n388  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nrecht  sonderbar,  daß  ich  so  oft  bin  abgehahen  worden, \r\ndas  Stück  zu  endigen,  und  daß  es  nun  in  Rom  fertig \r\nwerden  soll.  Der  erste  Akt  ist  ins  reine  und  zur  Reife; \r\nes  sind  ganze  Szenen  im  Stücke,  an  die  ich  nicht  zu \r\nrühren  brauche. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  über  allerlei  Kunst  so  viel  Gelegenheit  zu  den- \r\nken, daß  mein  Wilhelm  Meister  recht  anschwillt.  Nun \r\nsollen  aber  die  alten  Sachen  voraus  weg;  ich  bin  alt \r\ngenug,  und  wenn  ich  noch  etwas  machen  will,  darf  ich \r\nmich  nicht  säumen.  Wie  du  dir  leicht  denken  kannsi, \r\nhab  ich  hundert  neue  Dinge  im  Kopfe,  und  es  kommi \r\nnicht  aufs  Denken,  es  kommt  aufs  Machen  an:  das  ist  ein \r\nverwünschtes  Ding,  die  Gegenstande  hinzusetzen,  daß  sie \r\nnun  einmal  so  und  nicht  anders  dastehen.  Ich  möchte \r\nnun  recht  viel  von  der  Kunst  sprechen,  doch  ohne  die \r\nKunstwerke,  was  will  man  sagen?  Ich  hoffe,  über  manche \r\nKleinheit  wegzurücken;  drum  gönnt  mir  meine  Zeit,  die \r\nich  hier  so  wunderbar  und  sonderbar  zubringe;  gönnt  mir \r\nsie  durch  den  Beifall  eurer  Liebe. \r\n\r\nIch  muß  diesmal  schließen  und  wider  Willen  eine  leere \r\nSeite  schicken.  Die  Hitze  des  Tages  war  groß,  und  gegen \r\nAbend  bin  ich  eingeschlafen. \r\n\r\nDen  g.  Juli. \r\nIch  will  künftig  einiges  die  Woche  über  schreiben,  daß \r\nnicht  die  Hitze  des  Posttags  oder  ein  andrer  Zufall  mich \r\nhindre,  euch  ein  vernünftiges  Wort  zu  sagen.  Gestern \r\nhab  ich  vieles  gesehen  und  wiedergesehen;  ich  bin  viel- \r\nleicht in  zwölf  Kirchen  gewesen,  wo  die  schönsten  Altar- \r\nblätter sind. \r\n\r\nDann  war  ich  mit  Angelica  bei  dem  Engländer  Moore, \r\neinem  Landschaftsmaler,  dessen  Bilder  meist  trefflich \r\ngedacht  sind.  Unter  andern  hat  er  eine  Sündflut  gemalt, \r\ndas  etwas  Einziges  ist.  Anstatt  daß  andere  ein  offnes \r\nMeer  genommen  haben,  das  immer  nur  die  Idee  von \r\neinem  weiten,  aber  nicht  hohen  Wasser  gibt,  hat  er  ein \r\ngeschlossenes  hohes  Bergtal  vorgestellt,  in  welches  die \r\nimmer  steigenden  Wasser  endlich  auch  hereinstürzen. \r\nMan  sieht  an  der  Form  der  Felsen,  daß  der  Wasserstand \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  389 \r\n\r\nsich  den  Gipfeln  nähert,  und  dadurch,  daß  es  hinten  quer- \r\nvor  zugeschlossen  ist,  die  Klippen  alle  steil  sind,  macht \r\nes  einen  fürchterlichen  Eflfekt.  Es  ist  gleichsam  nur  grau \r\nin  grau  gemalt:  das  schmutzige  aufgewühlte  Wasser,  der \r\ntriefende  Regen  verbinden  sich  aufs  innigste;  das  Wasser \r\nstürzt  und  trieft  von  den  Felsen,  als  wenn  die  ungeheuren \r\nMassen  sich  auch  in  dem  allgemeinen  Elemente  auflösen \r\nwollten,  und  die  Sonne  blickt  wie  ein  trüber  Mond  durch \r\nden  Wasserflor  durch,  ohne  zu  erleuchten,  und  doch  ist \r\nes  nicht  Nacht.  In  der  Mitte  des  Vordergrundes  ist  eine \r\nflache  isolierte  Felsenplatte,  auf  die  sich  einige  hülflose \r\nMenschen  retten  in  dem  Augenblick,  daß  die  Flut  her- \r\nanschwillt und  sie  bedecken  will.  Das  Ganze  ist  unglaub- \r\nlich gut  gedacht.  Das  Bild  ist  groß.  Es  kann  7 — 8  Fuß \r\nlang  und  5 — 6  Fuß  hoch  sein.  Von  den  andern  Bildern, \r\neinem  herrlich  schönen  Morgen,  einer  trefilichen  Nacht, \r\nsag  ich  gar  nichts. \r\n\r\nDrei  volle  Tage  war  Fest  auf  Ära  coeli  wegen  der  Beati- \r\nfikation  zweier  Heiligen  aus  dem  Orden  des  heiligen \r\nFranziskus.  Die  Dekoration  der  Kirche,  Musik,  Illumi- \r\nnation und  Feuerwerk  des  Nachts  zog  eine  große  Menge \r\nVolks  dahin.  Das  nah  gelegene  Kapitol  war  mit  erleuch- \r\ntet und  die  Feuerwerke  auf  dem  Platz  des  Kapitols  ab- \r\ngebrannt. Das  Ganze  zusammen  machte  sich  sehr  schön, \r\nobgleich  es  nur  ein  Nachspiel  von  St.  Peter  war.  Die \r\nRömerinnen  zeigen  sich  bei  dieser  Gelegenheit,  von  ihren \r\nMännern  oder  Freunden  begleitet,  des  Nachts  weiß  ge- \r\nkleidet mit  eineiii  schwarzen  Gürtel  und  sind  schön  und \r\nartig.  Auch  ist  im  Korso  jetzt  des  Nachts  häufiger  Spa- \r\nziergang und  Fahrt,  da  man  des  Tags  nicht  aus  dem \r\nHause  geht.  Die  Hitze  ist  sehr  leidlich  und  diese  Tage \r\nher  immer  ein  kühles  Windchen  wehend.  Ich  halte  mich \r\nin  meinem  kühlen  Saale  und  bin  still  und  vergnügt. \r\nIch  bin  fleißig,  mein  Egmont  rückt  sehr  vor.  Sonderbar \r\nists,  daß  sie  eben  jetzt  in  Brüssel  die  Szene  spielen,  wie \r\nich  sie  vor  zwölf  Jahren  aufschrieb;  man  wird  vieles  jetzt \r\nfür  Pasquill  halten. \r\n\r\n\r\n390  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDen  1 6.  Juli. \r\nEs  ist  schon  weit  in  der  Nacht,  und  man  merkt  es  nicht; \r\ndenn  die  Straße  ist  voll  Menschen,  die  singend,  auf \r\nZithern  und  Violinen  spielend,  miteinander  wechselnd; \r\nauf  und  ab  gehn.  Die  Nächte  sind  kühl  und  erquickend, \r\ndie  Tage  nicht  unleidlich  heiß. \r\n\r\nGestern  war  ich  mit  Angelica  in  der  Farnesina,  wo  die \r\nFabel  der  Psyche  gemalt  ist.  Wie  oft  und  unter  wie  man- \r\nchen Situationen  hab  ich  die  bunten  Kopien  dieser  Bilder \r\nin  meinen  Zimmern  mit  euch  angesehn!  Es  fiel  mir  recht \r\nauf,  da  ich  sie  eben  durch  jene  Kopien  fast  auswendig \r\nweiß.  Dieser  Saal  oder  vielmehr  Galerie  ist  das  Schönste, \r\nwas  ich  von  Dekoration  kenne,  soviel  auch  jetzt  dran \r\nverdorben  und  restauriert  ist. \r\n\r\nHeute  war  Tierhetze  in  dem  Grabmal  des  August.  Dieses \r\ngroße,  inwendig  leere,  oben  ofthe,  ganz  runde  Gebäude \r\nist  jetzt  zu  einem  Kampfplatz,  zu  einer  Ochsenhetze  ein- \r\ngerichtet, wie  eine  Art  Amphitheater.  Es  wird  vier-  bis \r\nfünftausend  Menschen  fassen  können.  Das  Schauspiel \r\nselbst  hat  mich  nicht  sehr  erbaut. \r\n\r\nDienstag  den  ly.  Juli \r\nwar  ich  abends  bei  Albacini,  dem  Restaurator  antiker \r\nStatuen,  um  einen  Torso  zu  sehen,  den  sie  unter  den \r\nFarnesinischen  Besitzungen,  die  nach  Neapel  gehen,  ge- \r\nfunden haben.  Es  ist  ein  Torso  eines  sitzenden  Apolls \r\nund  hat  an  Schönheit  vielleicht  nicht  seinesgleichen;  we- \r\nnigstens kann  er  unter  die  ersten  Sachen  gesetzt  werden, \r\ndie  vom  Altertum  übrig  sind. \r\n\r\nIch  speiste  bei  Graf  Frieß;  Abbate  Casti,  der  mit  ihm \r\nreist,  rezitierte  eine  seiner  Novellen:  \"Der  Erzbischof  von \r\nPrag\",  die  nicht  sehr  ehrbar,  aber  außerordentlich  schön \r\nin  Ottave  rime  geschrieben  ist.  Ich  schätzte  ihn  schon \r\nals  den  Verfasser  meines  beliebten  Re  Teodoro  in  Venezia. \r\nEr  hat  nun  einen  Re  Teodoro  in  Corsica  geschrieben, \r\nwovon  ich  den  ersten  Akt  gelesen  habe;  auch  ein  ganz \r\nallerliebstes  Werk. \r\nGraf  Frieß  kauft  viel  und  hat  unter  andern  eine  Madonna \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  391 \r\n\r\nvon  Andrea  del  Sarto  für  600  Zechinen  gekauft.  Im \r\nvergangenen  März  hatte  Angelica  schon  450  drauf  ge- \r\nboten, hätte  auch  das  Ganze  dafür  gegeben,  wenn  ihr \r\nattenter  Gemahl  nicht  etwas  einzuwenden  gehabt  hätte. \r\nNun  reut  sies  beide.  Es  ist  ein  unglaublich  schön  Bild; \r\nman  hat  keine  Idee  von  so  etwas,  ohne  es  gesehn  zu \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  kommt  tagtäglich  etwas  Neues  zum  Vorschein, \r\nwas,  zu  dem  Alten  und  Bleibenden  gesellt,  ein  großes \r\nVergnügen  gewährt.  Mein  Auge  bildet  sich  gut  aus,  mit \r\nder  Zeit  könnte  ich  Kenner  werden. \r\nTischbein  beschwert  sich  in  einem  Briefe  über  die  ent- \r\nsetzliche Hitze  in  Neapel.  Hier  ist  sie  auch  stark  genug. \r\nAm  Dienstag  soll  es  so  heiß  gewesen  sein,  als  Fremde \r\nes  nicht  in  Spanien  und  Portugal  empfunden. \r\nEgiBont  ist  schon  bis  in  den  vierten  Akt  gediehen;  ich \r\nhoffe,  er  soll  euch  Freude  machen.  In  drei  Wochen  denke \r\nich  fertig  zu  sein,  und  ich  schicke  ihn  gleich  an  Her- \r\ndern ab. \r\n\r\nGezeichnet  und  illuminiert  wird  auch  fleißig.  Man  kann \r\nnicht  aus  dem  Hause  gehn,  nicht  die  kleinste  Promenade \r\nmachen,  ohne  die  würdigsten  Gegenstände  zu  treffen. \r\nMeine  Vorstellung,  mein  Gedächtnis  füllt  sich  voll  un- \r\nendlich schöner  Gegenstände. \r\n\r\nDen  20.  Juli. \r\nIch  habe  recht  diese  Zeit  her  zwei  meiner  Kapitalfehler, \r\ndie  mich  mein  ganzes  Leben  verfolgt  und  gepeinigt  haben, \r\nentdecken  können.  Einer  ist,  daß  ich  nie  das  Handwerk \r\neiner  Sache,  die  ich  treiben  wollte  oder  sollte,  lernen \r\nmochte.  Daher  ist  gekommen,  daß  ich  mit  so  viel  natür- \r\nlicher Anlage  so  wenig  gemacht  und  getan  habe.  Ent- \r\nweder es  war  durch  die  Kraft  des  Geistes  gezwungen, \r\ngelang  oder  mißlang,  wie  Glück  und  Zufall  es  wollten; \r\noder  wenn  ich  eine  Sache  gut  und  mit  Überlegung  machen \r\nwollte,  war  ich  furchtsam  und  konnte  nicht  fertig  werden. \r\nDer  andere,  nah  verwandte  Fehler  ist,  daß  ich  nie  so  viel \r\nZeit  auf  eine  Arbeit  oder  Geschäft  wenden  mochte,  als \r\ndazu  erfordert  wird.  Da  ich  die  Glückseligkeit  genieße, \r\n\r\n\r\n392  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nsehr  viel  in  kurzer  Zeit  denken  und  kombinieren  zu  kön- \r\nnen, so  ist  mir  eine  schrittweise  Ausführung  nojos  und \r\nunerträglich.  Nun,  dächt  ich,  wäre  Zeit  und  Stunde  da, \r\nsich  zu  korrigieren.  Ich  bin  im  Land  der  Künste:  laßt \r\nuns  das  Fach  durcharbeiten,  damit  wir  für  unser  übriges \r\nLeben  Ruh  und  Freude  haben  und  an  was  anders  gehen \r\nkönnen. \r\n\r\nRom  ist  ein  herrlicher  Ort  dazu.  Nicht  allein  die  Gegen- \r\nstände aller  Art  sind  hier,  sondern  auch  Menschen  aller \r\nArt,  denen  es  Ernst  ist,  die  auf  den  rechten  Wegen  gehen, \r\nmit  denen  man  sich  unterhaltend  gar  bequem  und  schleu- \r\nnig weiterbringen  kann.  Gott  sei  Dank,  ich  fange  an,  von \r\nandern  lernen  und  annehmen  zu  können. \r\nUnd  so  befinde  ich  mich  an  Leib  und  Seele  wohler  als \r\njemals!  Möchtet  ihr  es  an  meinen  Produktionen  sehen \r\nund  meine  Abwesenheit  preisen.  Durch  das,  was  ich \r\nmache  und  denke,  häng  ich  mit  euch  zusammen;  übri- \r\ngens bin  ich  freilich  sehr  allein  und  muß  meine  Ge- \r\nspräche modifizieren.  Doch  das  ist  hier  leichter  als \r\nirgendwo,  weil  man  mit  jedem  etwas  Interessantes  zu \r\nreden  hat. \r\n\r\nMengs  sagt  irgendwo  vom  Apoll  von  Belvedere,  daß  eine \r\nStatue,  die  zu  gleich  großem  Stil  mehr  Wahrheit  des \r\nFleisches  gesellte,  das  Größte  wäre,  was  der  Mensch \r\nsich  denken  könnte.'  Und  durch  jenen  Torso  eines  Apolls \r\noder  Bacchus,  dessen  ich  schon  gedacht,  scheint  sein \r\nWunsch,  seine  Prophezeiung  erfüllt  zu  sein.  Mein  Auge \r\nist  nicht  genug  gebildet,  um  in  einer  so  delikaten  Materie \r\nzu  entscheiden;  aber  ich  bin  selbst  geneigt,  diesen  Rest \r\nfür  das  Schönste  zu  halten,  was  ich  je  gesehen  habe. \r\nLeider  ist  es  nicht  allein  nur  Torso,  sondern  auch  die \r\nEpiderm  ist  an  vielen  Orten  weggewaschen;  er  muß  unter \r\neiner  Traufe  gestanden  haben. \r\n\r\nSonntags  den  22.  fuli \r\naß  ich  bei  Angelica;  es  ist  nun  schon  hergebracht,  daß \r\nich  ihr  Sonntag.sgast  bin.  Vorher  fuhren  wir  nach  dem \r\nPalast  Barberini,  den  trefflichen  Leonard  da  Vinci  und \r\ndie    Geliebte    des   Rafifael,    von   ihm  selbst  gemalt,  zu \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  393 \r\n\r\nsehen.  Mit  Angelica  ist  es  gar  angenehm  Gemälde  zu \r\nbetrachten,  da  ihr  Auge  sehr  gebildet  und  ihre  mecha- \r\nnische Kunstkenntnis  so  groß  ist.  Dabei  ist  sie  sehr  für \r\nalles  Schöne,  Wahre,  Zarte  empfindlich  und  unglaublich \r\nbescheiden. \r\n\r\nNachmittags  war  ich  beim  Chevalier  d'Agincourt,  einem \r\nreichen  Franzosen,  der  seine  Zeit  und  sein  Geld  anwen- \r\ndet, eine  Geschichte  der  Kunst  von  ihrem  Verfall  bis \r\nzur  Auflebung  zu  schreiben.  Die  Sammlungen,  die  er \r\ngemacht  hat,  sind  höchst  interessant.  ]\\Ian  sieht,  wie  der \r\nMenschengeist  während  der  trüben  und  dunkeln  Zeit \r\nimmer  geschäftig  war.  Wenn  das  Werk  zusammenkömmt, \r\nwird  es  sehr  merkwürdig  sein. \r\n\r\nJetzt  habe  ich  etwas  vor,  daran  ich  viel  lerne:  ich  habe \r\neine  Landschaft  erfunden  und  gezeichnet,  die  ein  ge- \r\nschickter Künstler,  Dies,  in  meiner  Gegenwart  koloriert; \r\ndadurch  gewöhnt  sich  Auge  und  Geist  immer  mehr  an \r\nFarbe  und  Harmonie.  Überhaupt  geht  es  gut  fort,  ich \r\ntreibe  nur,  wie  immer,  zu  viel.  Meine  größte  Freude  ist, \r\ndaß  mein  Auge  sich  an  sichern  Formen  bildet  und  sich \r\nan  Gestalt  und  Verhältnis  leicht  gewöhnt  und  dabei  mein \r\nalt  Gefühl  für  Haltung  und  Ganzes  recht  lebhaft  wieder- \r\nkehrt. Auf  Übung  käme  nun  alles  an. \r\n\r\nMontag  doi  23.  Juli \r\nbestieg  ich  abends  die  Trajanische  Säule,  um  des  un- \r\nschätzbaren Anblicks  zu  genießen.  Von  dort  oben  herab, \r\nbei  untergehender  Sonne,  nimmt  sich  das  Coliseum  ganz \r\nherrlich  aus;  das  Kapitol  ganz  nahe,  der  Palatin  dahinter, \r\ndie  Stadt,  die  sich  anschließt.  Ich  ging  erst  spät  und  lang- \r\nsam durch  die  Straßen  zurück.  Ein  merkwürdiger  Gegen- \r\nstand ist  der  Platz  von  Monte  Cavallo  mit  dem  Obelisk. \r\n\r\nDienstag  den  24.  Juli. \r\nNach  der  Villa  Patrizzi,  um  die  Sonne  untergehen  zu \r\nsehen,  der  frischen  Luft  zu  genießen,  meinen  Geist  recht \r\nmit  dem  Bilde  der  großen  Stadt  anzufüllen,  durch  die \r\nlangen  Linien  meinen  Gesichtskreis  auszuweiten  und  zu \r\nvereinfachen,  durch  die  vielen  schönen  und  mannigfaltigen \r\n\r\n\r\n394  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nGegenstände  zu  bereichern.  Diesen  Abend  sah  ich  den \r\nPlatz  der  Antoninischen  Säule,  den  Palast  Chigi  vom \r\nMond  erleuchtet,  und  die  Säule,  von  Alter  schwarz,  vor \r\ndem  helleren  Nachthimmel,  mit  einem  weißen,  glänzenden \r\nPiedestal.  Und  wie  viel  andere  unzählige  schöne  einzelne \r\nGegenstände  trifft  man  auf  so  einer  Promenade  an.  Aber \r\nwie  viel  dazu  gehört,  sich  nur  einen  geringen  Teil  von \r\nallem  diesen  zuzueignen!  Es  gehört  ein  Menschenleben \r\ndazu,  ja  das  Leben  vieler  Menschen,  die  immer  stufen- \r\nweis voneinander  lernen. \r\n\r\nMittiiwch  den  25.  Juli. \r\nIch  war  mit  dem  Grafen  Frieß,  die  Gemmensammlung \r\ndes  Prinzen  von  Piombino  zu  sehen. \r\n\r\nFreitag  den  2'jsten. \r\nÜbrigens  helfen  mir  alle  Künstler,  alt  und  jung,  um  mein \r\nTalentchen  zuzustutzen  und  zu  erweitern.  In  der  Per- \r\nspektiv  und  Baukunst  bin  ich  vorgerückt,  auch  in  der \r\nKomposition  der  Landschaft.  An  den  lebendigen  Krea- \r\nturen hängts  noch,  da  ist  ein  Abgrund;  doch  wäre  mit \r\nErnst  und  Applikation  hier  auch  weiter  zu  kommen. \r\nIch  weiß  nicht,  ob  ich  ein  Wort  von  dem  Konzert  sagte, \r\ndas  ich  zu  Ende  voriger  Woche  gab.  Ich  lud  diejenigen \r\nPersonen  dazu,  die  mir  hier  manches  Vergnügen  ver- \r\nschafft haben,  und  ließ  durch  die  Sänger  der  komischen \r\nOper  die  besten  Stücke  der  letzten  Intermezzen  aufführen. \r\nJedermann  war  vergnügt  und  zufrieden. \r\nNun  ist  mein  Saal  schön  aufgeräumt  und  aufgeputzt:  es \r\nlebt  sich  bei  der  großen  Wärme  aufs  angenehmste  darin. \r\nWir  haben  einen  trüben,  einen  Regentag,  ein  Donner- \r\nwetter, nun  einige  heitere,  nicht  sehr  heiße  Tage  ge- \r\nhabt. \r\n\r\nSonntag  den  29.  Juli \r\nwar  ich  mit  Angelica  in  dem  Palast  Rondanini.  Ihr  wer- \r\ndet euch  aus  meinen  ersten  römischen  Briefen  einer \r\nMeduse  erinnern,  die  mir  damals  schon  so  sehr  einleuch- \r\ntete, jetzt  nun  aber  mir  die  größte  Freude  gibt.    Nur \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  395 \r\n\r\neinen  Begrifif  zu  haben,  daß  so  etwas  in  der  Welt  ist,  daß \r\nso  etwas  zu  machen  möglich  war,  macht  einen  zum  dop- \r\npelten Menschen.  Wie  gern  sagt  ich  etwas  drüber,  wenn \r\nnicht  alles,  was  man  über  so  ein  Werk  sagen  kann,  leerer \r\nWindhauch  wäre.  Die  Kunst  ist  deshalb  da,  daß  man  sie \r\nsehe,  nicht  davon  spreche,  als  höchstens  in  ihrer  Gegen- \r\nwart. Wie  schäme  ich  mich  alles  Kunstgeschwätzes,  in \r\ndas  ich  ehemals  einstimmte.  Wenn  es  möglich  ist,  einen \r\nguten  Gipsabguß  von  dieser  Meduse  zu  haben,  so  bring \r\nich  ihn  mit,  doch  sie  müßte  neu  geformt  werden.  Es  sind \r\neinige  hier  zu  Kaufe,  die  ich  nicht  möchte;  denn  sie  ver- \r\nderben mehr  die  Idee,  als  daß  sie  uns  den  Begriff  gäben \r\nund  erhielten.  Besonders  ist  der  Mund  unaussprechlich \r\nund  unnachahmlich  groß. \r\n\r\nMontag  den  ßosten \r\nblieb  ich  den  ganzen  Tag  zu  Hause  und  war  fleißig.  Eg- \r\nraont  ruckt  zum  Ende;  der  vierte  Akt  ist  so  gut  wie  fertig. \r\nSobald  er  abgeschrieben  ist,  schick  ich  ihn  mit  der  reiten- \r\nden Post.  Welche  Freude  wird  mirs  sein,  von  euch  zu \r\nhören,  daß  ihr  dieser  Produktion  einigen  Beifall  gebt.  Ich \r\nfühle  mich  recht  jung  wieder,  da  ich  das  Stück  schreibe; \r\nmöchte  es  auch  auf  den  Leser  einen  frischen  Eindruck \r\nmachen.  Abends  war  ein  kleiner  Ball  in  dem  Garten \r\nhinter  dem  Hause,  wozu  wir  auch  eingeladen  wurden. \r\nUngeachtet  jetzt  keine  Jahrszeit  des  Tanzes  ist,  so  war \r\nman  doch  ganz  lustig.  Die  italienischen  Mäuschen  haben \r\nihre  Eigentümlichkeiten:  vor  zehn  Jahren  hätten  einige \r\npassieren  können,  nun  ist  diese  Ader  vertrocknet,  und \r\nes  gab  mir  diese  kleine  Feierlichkeit  kaum  so  viel  Inter- \r\nesse, um  sie  bis  ans  Ende  auszuhalten.  Die  Mondnächte \r\nsind  ganz  unglaublich  schön,  der  Aufgang,  eh  sich  der \r\nMond  durch  die  Dünste  heraufgearbeitet  hat,  ganz  gelb \r\nund  warm,  come  il  sole  d'Inghilterra,  die  übrige  Nacht \r\nklar  und  freundlich.  Ein  kühler  Wind,  und  alles  fängt \r\nan,  zu  leben.  Bis  gegen  Morgen  sind  immer  Partien  auf \r\nder  Straße,  die  singen  und  spielen;  man  hört  manch- \r\nmal Duette,  so  schön  und  schöner  als  in  einer  Oper  oder \r\nKonzert. \r\n\r\n\r\n396  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDie?istag  den  31.  Juli \r\nwurden  einige  Mondscheine  aufs  Papier  gebracht,  dann \r\nsonst  allerlei  gute  Kunst  getrieben.  Abends  ging  ich  mit \r\neinem  Landsmann  spazieren,  und  wir  stritten  über  den \r\nVorzug  von  Michel  Angelo  und  Raffael;  ich  hielt  die  Par- \r\ntie des  ersten,  er  des  andern,  und  wir  schlössen  zuletzt \r\nmit  einem  gemeinschaftlichen  Lob  auf  Leonard  da  Vinci. \r\nWie  glücklich  bin  ich,  daß  nun  alle  diese  Namen  aufhören, \r\nNamen  zu  sein,  und  lebendige  Begriffe  des  Wertes  dieser \r\ntrefflichen  Menschen  nach  und  nach  vollständig  werden. \r\nNachts  in  die  komische  Oper.  Ein  neues  Intermezz  L'Im- \r\npresario  in  angustie,  ist  ganz  vortrefflich  und  wird  uns \r\nmanche  Nacht  unterhalten,  so  heiß  es  auch  im  Schauspiele \r\nsein  mag.  Ein  Quintett,  da  der  Poeta  sein  Stück  vorliest, \r\nder  Impresar  und  die  prima  donna  auf  der  einen  Seite \r\nihm  Beifall  geben,  der  Komponist  und  die  seconda  donna \r\nauf  der  andern  ihn  tadeln,  worüber  sie  zuletzt  in  einen \r\nallgemeinen  Streit  geraten,  ist  gar  glücklich.  Die  als \r\nFrauenzimmer  verkleideten  Kastraten  machen  ihre  Rollen \r\nimmer  besser  und  gefallen  immer  mehr.  Wirklich  für \r\neine  kleine  Sommertruppe,  die  sich  nur  so  zusammen- \r\ngefunden hat,  ist  sie  recht  artig.  Sie  spielen  mit  einer \r\ngroßen  Natürlichkeit  und  gutem  Humor.  Von  der  Hitze \r\nstehen  die  armen  Teufel  erbärmlich  aus. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nJuli \r\n\r\nUm  nachstehendes,  welches  ich  nunmehr  einzuführen  ge- \r\ndenke, schicklicherweise  vorzubereiten,  halte  für  nötig, \r\neinige  Stellen  aus  dem  vorigen  Bande,  welche  dort,  im \r\nLaufe  der  Ereignisse,  der  Aufmerksamkeit  möchten  eftt- \r\ngangen  sein,  hier  einzuschalten  und  die  mir  so  wichtige \r\nAngelegenheit  den  Freunden  der  Naturwissenschaft  da- \r\ndurch abermals  zu  empfehlen. \r\n\r\nPalermo^  Dienstag  den  ly.  April  lySy. \r\nEs  ist  ein  wahres  Unglück,  wenn  man  von  vielerlei  Geistern \r\nverfolgt  und  versucht  wird!    Heute  früh  ging  ich  mit  dem \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  397 \r\n\r\nfesten,  ruhigen  Vorsatz,  meine  dichterischen  Träume  fort- \r\nzusetzen, nach  dem  öffentlichen  Garten;  allein  eh  ich \r\nmichs  versah,  erhaschte  mich  ein  anderes  Gespenst,  das \r\nmir  schon  diese  Tage  nachgeschlichen.  Die  vielen  Pflanzen, \r\ndie  ich  sonst  nur  in  Kübeln  und  Töpfen,  ja  die  größte \r\nZeit  des  Jahres  nur  hinter  Glasfenstern  zu  sehen  gewohnt \r\nwar,  stehen  hier  froh  und  frisch  unter  freiem  Himmel, \r\nund  indem  sie  ihre  Bestimmung  vollkommen  erfüllen, \r\nwerden  sie  uns  deutlicher.  Im  Angesicht  so  vielerlei \r\nneuen  und  erneuten  Gebildes  fiel  mir  die  alte  Grille  wie- \r\nder ein,  ob  ich  nicht  unter  dieser  Schar  die  Urpflanze \r\nentdecken  könnte.  Eine  solche  muß  es  denn  doch  geben! \r\nWoran  würde  ich  sonst  erkennen,  daß  dieses  oder  jenes \r\nGebilde  eine  Pflanze  sei,  wenn  sie  nicht  alle  nach  einem \r\nMuster  gebildet  wären? \r\n\r\nIch  bemühte  mich,  zu  untersuchen,  worin  denn  die  vielen \r\nabweichenden  Gestalten  voneinander  unterschieden  seien. \r\nUnd  ich  fand  sie  immer  mehr  ähnlich  als  verschieden, \r\nund  wollte  ich  meine  botanische  Terminologie  anbringen, \r\nso  ging  das  wohl,  aber  es  fruchtete  nicht,  es  machte  mich \r\nimruhig,  ohne  daß  es  mir  weiter  half.  Gestört  war  mein \r\nguter  poetischer  Vorsatz;  der  Garten  des  Alkinous  war \r\nverschwunden,  ein  Weltgarten  hatte  sich  aufgetan.  War- \r\num sind  wir  Neueren  doch  so  zerstreut,  warum  gereizt \r\nzu  Forderungen,  die  wir  nicht  erreichen  noch  erfüllen \r\nkönnen! \r\n\r\nNeapel,  den  ly.  Mai  lySy. \r\nFerner  muß  ich  dir  vertrauen,  daß  ich  dem  Geheimnis \r\nder  Pflanzenzeugung  und  -Organisation  ganz  nahe  bin  und \r\ndaß  es  das  Einfachste  ist,  was  nur  gedacht  werden  kann. \r\nUnter  diesem  Himmel  kann  man  die  schönsten  Beob- \r\nachtungen machen.  Den  Hauptpunkt,  wo  der  Keim  steckt, \r\nhabe  ich  ganz  klar  und  zweifellos  gefunden;  alles  übrige \r\nseh  ich  auch  schon  im  ganzen,  und  nur  noch  einige  Punkte \r\nmüssen  bestimmter  werden.  Die  Urpflanze  wird  das \r\nwunderlichste  Geschöpf  von  der  Welt,  um  welches  mich \r\ndie  Natur  selbst  beneiden  soll.  Mit  diesem  Modell  und \r\ndem  Schlüssel  dazu  kann  man  alsdann  noch  Pflanzen  ins \r\n\r\n\r\n398  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nUnendliche  erfinden,  die  konsequent  sein  müssen,  das \r\nheißt:  die,  wenn  sie  auch  nicht  existieren,  doch  existieren \r\nkönnten  und  nicht  etwa  malerische  oder  dichterische \r\nSchatten  und  Scheine  sind,  sondern  eine  innerliche  Walir- \r\nheit  und  Notwendigkeit  haben.  Dasselbe  Gesetz  wird \r\nsich  auf  alles  übrige  Lebendige  anwenden  lassen. \r\n\r\nSo  viel  aber  sei  hier,  ferneres  Verständnis  vorzubereiten, \r\nkürzlich  ausgesprochen:  Es  war  mir  nämlich  aufgegangen, \r\ndaß  in  demjenigen  Organ  der  Pflanze,  welches  wir  als \r\nBlatt  gewöhnlich  anzusprechen  pflegen,  der  wahre  Proteus \r\nverborgen  liege,  der  sich  in  allen  Gestaltungen  verstecken \r\nund  off\"enbaren  könne.  Vorwärts  und  rückwärts  ist  die \r\nPflanze  immer  nur  Blatt,  mit  dem  künftigen  Keime  so \r\nunzertrennlich  vereint,  daß  man  eins  ohne  das  andere \r\nnicht  denken  darf.  Einen  solchen  Begriff  zu  fassen,  zu \r\nertragen,  ihn  in  der  Natur  aufzufinden,  ist  eine  Aufgabe, \r\ndie  uns  in  einen  peinlich  süßen  Zustand  versetzt. \r\n\r\nStörende  Naturbetrachtungen \r\n\r\nWer  an  sich  erfahren  hat,  was  ein  reichhaltiger  Gedanke \r\nheißen  will,  er  sei  nun  aus  uns  selbst  entsprungen  oder \r\nvon  andern  mitgeteilt  und  eingeimpft,  wird  gestehen,  was \r\ndadurch  für  eine  leidenschaftliche  Bewegung  in  unserm \r\nGeiste  hervorgebracht  werde,  wie  wir  uns  begeistert  fühlen, \r\nindem  wir  alles  dasjenige  in  Gesamtheit  vorausahnen,  was \r\nin  der  Folge  sich  mehr  und  mehr  entwickeln,  wozu  das \r\nEntwickelte  weiter  führen  soll.  Dieses  bedenkend,  wird \r\nman  mir  zugestehen,  daß  ich  von  einem  solchen  Gewalir- \r\nwerden  wie  von  einer  Leidenschaft  eingenommen  und \r\ngetrieben  worden  und,  wo  nicht  ausschließlich,  doch  durch \r\nalles  übrige  Leben  hindurch  mich  damit  beschäftigen \r\nmüssen. \r\n\r\nSo  sehr  nun  auch  diese  Neigung  mich  innerlichst  ergriffen \r\nhatte,  so  war  doch  an  kein  geregeltes  Studium  nach  meiner \r\nRückkehr  in  Rom  zu  denken;  Poesie,  Kunst  und  Alter- \r\ntum, jedes  forderte  mich  gewissermaßen  ganz,  und  ich \r\nhabe  in  meinem  Leben  nicht  leicht  operosere,  mühsamer \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  399 \r\n\r\nbeschäftigte  Tage  zugebracht.  Männern  vom  Fach  wird \r\nes  vielleicht  gar  zu  naiv  vorkommen,  wenn  ich  erzähle, \r\nwie  ich  tagtäglich,  in  einem  jeden  Garten,  auf  Spazier- \r\ngängen, kleinen  Lustfahrten,  mich  der  neben  mir  be- \r\nmerkten Pflanzen  bemächtigte.  Besonders  bei  der  ein- \r\ntretenden Samenreife  war  es  mir  wichtig,  zu  beobachten, \r\nwie  manche  davon  an  das  Tageslicht  hervortraten.  So \r\nwendete  ich  meine  Aufmerksamkeit  auf  das  Keimen  des \r\nwährend  seines  Wachstums  unförmlichen  Cactus  Opuntia \r\nund  sah  mit  Vergnügen,  daß  er  ganz  unschuldig  dikoty- \r\nledonisch  sich  in  zwei  zarten  Blättchen  enthüllte,  sodann \r\naber,  bei  fernerem  Wüchse,  sich  die  künftige  Unform \r\nentwickelte. \r\n\r\nAuch  mit  Samenkapseln  begegnete  mir  etwas  Auffallen- \r\ndes; ich  hatte  derselben  mehrere  von  Acanthus  moUis \r\nnach  Hause  getragen  und  in  einem  ofifenen  Kästchen \r\nniedergelegt;  nun  geschah  es  in  einer  Nacht,  daß  ich  ein \r\nKnistern  hörte  und  bald  darauf  das  Umherspringen  an \r\nDecke  und  Wände  wie  von  kleinen  Körpern.  Ich  erklärte \r\nmirs  nicht  gleich,  fand  aber  nachher  meine  Schoten  auf- \r\ngesprungen und  die  Samen  umher  zerstreut.  Die  Trockne \r\ndes  Zimmers  hatte  die  Reife  bis  zu  solcher  Elastizität  in \r\nwenigen  Tagen  vollendet. \r\n\r\nUnter  den  vielen  Samen,  die  ich  auf  diese  Weise  beob-- \r\nachtete,  muß  ich  einiger  noch  erwähnen,  weil  sie  zu \r\nmeinem  Andenken  kürzer  oder  länger  in  dem  alten  Rom \r\nfortwuchsen.  Pinienkerne  gingen  gar  merkwürdig  auf;  sie \r\nhüben  sich,  wie  in  einem  Ei  eingeschlossen,  empor,  warfen \r\naber  diese  Haube  bald  ab  und  zeigten  in  einem  Kranze \r\nvon  grünen  Nadeln  schon  die  Anfänge  ihrer  künftigen \r\nBestimmung. \r\n\r\nGalt  das  Bisherige  der  Fortpflanzung  durch  Samen,  so \r\nward  ich  auf  die  Fortpflanzung  durch  Augen  nicht  weniger \r\naufmerksam  gemacht,  und  zwar  durch  Rat  Reiflenstein, \r\nder  auf  allen  Spaziergängen,  hier  und  dort  einen  Zweig \r\nabreißend,  bis  zur  Pedanterie  behauptete,  in  die  Erde \r\ngesteckt  müsse  jeder  sogleich  fortwachsen.  Zum  ent- \r\nscheidenden Beweis  zeigte  er  dergleichen  Stecklinge  gar \r\nwohl  angeschlagen  in  seinem  Garten.   Und  wie  bedeutend \r\n\r\n\r\n400  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nist  nicht  in  der  Folgezeit  eine  solche  allgemein  versuchte \r\nVermehrung  für  die  botanische  Gärtnerei  geworden,  die \r\nich  ihm  wohl  zu  erleben  gewünscht  hätte. \r\nAm  auffallendsten  war  mir  jedoch  ein  strauchartig  in  die \r\nHöhe  gewachsener  Nelkenstock.  Man  kennt  die  gewaltige \r\nLebens-  und  Vermehrungskraft  dieser  Pflanze;  Auge  ist \r\nüber  Auge  an  ihren  Zweigen  gedrängt,  Knoten  in  Knoten \r\nhineingetrichtert;  dieses  wird  nun  hier  durch  Dauer  ge- \r\nsteigert und  die  Augen  aus  unerforschlicher  Enge  zur \r\nhöchstmöglichen  Entwickelimg  getrieben,  so  daß  selbst \r\ndie  vollendete  Blume  wieder  vier  vollendete  Blumen  aus \r\nihrem  Busen  hervorbrachte. \r\n\r\nZu  Aufbewahrung  dieser  Wundergestalt  kein  Mittel  vor \r\nmir  sehend,  unternahm  ich  es,  sie  genau  zu  zeichnen, \r\nwobei  ich  immer  zu  mehrerer  Einsicht  in  den  Grund- \r\nbegrifif  der  Metamorphose  gelangte.  Allein  die  Zerstreu- \r\nung durch  so  vielerlei  Obliegenheiten  ward  nur  desto \r\nzudringlicher  und  mein  Aufenthalt  in  Rom,  dessen  Ende \r\nich  voraussah,  immer  peinlicher  und  belasteter. \r\n\r\nNachdem  ich  mich  nun  so  geraume  Zeit  ganz  im  stillen \r\ngehalten  und  von  aller  höheren  zerstreuenden  Gesellschaft \r\nfern  geblieben,  begingen  wir  einen  Fehler,  der  die  Auf- \r\nmerksamkeit des  ganzen  Quartiers,  nicht  weniger  der \r\nnach  neuen  und  seltsamen  Vorfällen  sich  umschauenden \r\nSozietät  auf  uns  richtete.  Die  Sache  verhielt  sich  aber \r\nalso:  Angelica  kam  nie  ins  Theater;  wir  untersuchten \r\nnicht,  aus  welcher  Ursache,  aber  da  wir  als  leidenschaft- \r\nliche Bühnenfreunde  in  ihrer  Gegenwart  die  Anmut  und \r\nGewandtheit  der  Sänger,  sowie  die  Wirksamkeit  der  Musik \r\nunseres  Cimarosa  nicht  genugsam  zu  rühmen  wußten  und \r\nnichts  sehnlicher  wünschten,  als  sie  solcher  Genüsse  teil- \r\nhaftig zu  machen,  so  ergab  sich  eins  aus  dem  andern, \r\ndaß  nämlich  unsere  jungen  Leute,  besonders  Bury,  der \r\nmit  den  Sängern  und  Musikverwandten  in  dem  besten \r\nVernehmen  stand,  es  dahin  brachte,  daß  diese  sich  in \r\nheiterer  Gesinnung  erboten,  auch  vor  uns,  ihren  leiden- \r\nschaftlichen Freunden  und  entschieden  Beifall  Gebenden, \r\ngelegentlich  einmal  in  unserm  Saale  Musik  machen  und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  401 \r\n\r\nsingen  zu  wollen.  Dergleichen  Vorhaben,  öfter  besprochen, \r\n\r\nvorgeschlagen  und  verzögert,  gelangte  doch  endlich  nach \r\ndem  Wunsche  der  Jüngern  Teilnehmer  zur  fröhlichen \r\nWirklichkeit.  Konzertmeister  Kranz,  ein  geübter  Violi- \r\nnist, in  herzoglich  weimarischen  Diensten,  der  sich  in \r\nItalien  auszubilden  Urlaub  hatte,  gab  zuletzt  durch  seine \r\nunvermutete  Ankunft  eine  baldige  Entscheidung.  Sein \r\nTalent  legte  sich  auf  die  Wage  der  Musiklustigen,  und \r\nwir  sahen  uns  in  den  Fall  versetzt,  Madam  Angelica, \r\nihren  Gemahl,  Hofrat  Reifienstein,  die  Herren  Jenkins, \r\nVolpato,  und  wem  wir  sonst  eine  Artigkeit  schuldig  waren, \r\nzu  einem  anständigen  Feste  einladen  zu  können.  Juden \r\nund  Tapezier  hatten  den  Saal  geschmückt,  der  nächste \r\nKaffeewirt  die  Erfrischungen  übernommen,  und  so  ward \r\nein  glänzendes  Konzert  aufgeführt  in  der  schönsten \r\nSommernacht,  wo  sich  große  Massen  von  Menschen  unter \r\nden  offenen  Fenstern  versammelten  und,  als  wären  sie  im \r\nTheater  gegenwärtig,  die  Gesänge  gehörig  beklatschten. \r\nJa  was  das  Auffallendste  war,  ein  großer,  mit  einem  Or- \r\nchester von  Musikfreunden  besetzter  Gesellschaftswagen, \r\nder  soeben  durch  die  nächtliche  Stadt  seine  Lustrunde \r\nzu  machen  beliebte,  hielt  unter  unseren  Fenstern  stille, \r\nund  nachdem  er  den  obern  Bemühungen  lebhaften  Bei- \r\nfall geschenkt  hatte,  ließ  sich  eine  wackre  Baßstimme \r\nvernehmen,  die  eine  der  beliebtesten  Arien  eben  der  Oper, \r\nwelche  wir  stückweise  vortrugen,  von  allen  Instrumenten \r\nbegleitet  hinzugesellte.  Wir  erwiderten  den  vollsten  Bei- \r\nfall, das  Volk  klatschte  mit  drein,  und  jedermann  ver- \r\nsicherte, an  so  mancher  Nachtlust,  niemals  aber  an  einer \r\nso  vollkommenen,  zufällig  gelungenen  teilgenommen  zu \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nAuf  einmal  nun  zog  unsere  zwar  anständige,  aber  doch \r\nstille  Wohnung  dem  Palast  Rondanini  gegenüber  die  Auf- \r\nmerksamkeit des  Korso  auf  sich.  Ein  reicher  Milordo, \r\nhieß  es,  müsse  da  eingezogen  sein,  niemand  aber  wußte \r\nihn  unter  den  bekannten  Persönlichkeiten  zu  finden  und \r\nzu  entzifiern.  Freilich,  hätte  ein  dergleichen  Fest  sollen \r\nmit  barem  Gelde  geleistet  werden,  so  würde  dasjenige, \r\nwas  hier  von  Künstlern  Künstlern  zuliebe  geschah  und \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  c6 \r\n\r\n\r\n40  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nmit  mäßigem  Aufwand  zur  Ausführung  zu  bringen  war, \r\nbedeutende  Kosten  verursacht  haben.  Wir  setzten  nun \r\nzwar  unser  voriges  stilles  Leben  fort,  konnten  aber  das \r\nVorurteil  von  Reichtum  und  vornehmer  Geburt  nicht  mehr \r\nvon  uns  ablehnen. \r\n\r\nZu  einer  lebhaftem  Geselligkeit  gab  sodann  auch  die  An- \r\nkunft des  Grafen  Frieß  neuen  Anlaß.  Er  hatte  den  Abbate \r\nCasti  bei  sich,  welcher  durch  Vorlesung  seiner  damals \r\nnoch  ungedruckten  galanten  Erzählungen  große  Lust  er- \r\nregte; sein  heiterer  freier  Vortrag  schien  jene  geistreichen, \r\nübermäßig  genialen  Darstellungen  vollkommen  ins  Leben \r\nzu  bringen.  Wir  bedauerten  nur,  daß  ein  so  gut  gesinnter, \r\nreicher  Kunstliebhaber  nicht  immer  von  den  zuverlässig- \r\nsten Menschen  bedient  werde.  Der  Ankauf  eines  unter- \r\ngeschobenen geschnittenen  Steines  machte  viel  Reden \r\nund  Verdruß.  Er  konnte  sich  indessen  über  den  Ankauf \r\neiner  schönen  Statue  gar  wohl  erfreuen,  die  eiiien  Paris, \r\nnach  der  Auslegung  anderer  einen  Mithras  vorstellte. \r\nDas  Gegenbild  steht  jetzt  im  MuseoPio-Clementino;  beide \r\nwaren  zusammen  in  einer  Sandgrube  gefunden  worden. \r\nDoch  waren  es  nicht  die  Unterhändler  in  Kunstgeschäften \r\nallein,  die  ihm  auflauerten,  er  hatte  manches  Abenteuer \r\nzu  bestehen;  und  da  er  sich  überhaupt  in  der  heißen \r\nJahrszeit  nicht  zu  schonen  wußte,  so  könnt  es  nicht  fehlen, \r\ndaß  er  von  mancherlei  Übeln  angefallen  wurde,  welche \r\ndie  letzten  Tage  seines  Aufenthalts  verbitterten.  Mir \r\naber  war  es  um  so  schmerzlicher,  als  ich  seiner  Gefällig- \r\nkeit gar  manches  schuldig  geworden;  wie  ich  denn  auch \r\ndie  treffliche  Gemmensammlung  des  Prinzen  von  Piom- \r\nbino  mit  ihm  zu  betrachten  günstige  Gelegenheit  fand. \r\n\r\nBeim  Grafen  Frieß  fanden  sich  außer  den  Kunsthändlern \r\nauch  wohl  derart  Literaturen,  wie  sie  hier  in  Abbt^- \r\nTracht  herumwandern.  Mit  diesen  war  kein  angenehmes \r\nGespräch.  Kaum  hatte  man  von  nationaler  Dichtung  zu \r\nsprechen  angefangen  und  sich  über  ein  und  andern  Punkt \r\nzu  belehren  gesucht,  so  mußte  man  unmittelbar  und  ohne \r\nweiteres  die  Frage  vernehmen,  ob  man  Ariost  oder  Tasso, \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  403 \r\n\r\nwelchen  von  beiden  man  für  den  größten  Dichter  halte. \r\nAntwortete  man,  Gott  und  der  Natur  sei  zu  danken,  daß \r\nsie  zwei  solche  vorzügliche  Männer  einer  Nation  ge- \r\ngönnt, deren  jeder  uns,  nach  Zeit  und  Umständen,  nach \r\nLagen  und  Empfindungen,  die  herrlichsten  Augenblicke \r\nverliehen,  uns  beruhigt  und  entzückt — dies  vernünftige \r\nWort  ließ  niemand  gelten.  Nun  wurde  derjenige,  für  den \r\nman  sich  entschieden  hatte,  hoch  und  höher  gehoben, \r\nder  andere  tief  und  tiefer  dagegen  herabgesetzt.  Die \r\nersten  Male  sucht  ich  die  Verteidigung  des  Herabgesetz- \r\nten zu  übernehmen  und  seine  Vorzüge  geltend  zu  machen; \r\ndies  aber  verfing  nicht,  man  hatte  Partei  ergriffen  und \r\nblieb  auf  seinem  Sinne.  Da  nun  eben  dasselbe  immer \r\nfort  und  fort  sich  wiederholte  und  es  mir  zu  ernst  war, \r\num  dialektisch  über  dergleichen  Gegenstände  zu  kontro- \r\nversieren,  so  vermied  ich  ein  solches  Gespräch,  beson- \r\nders da  ich  merkte,  daß  es  nur  Phrasen  waren,  die  man, \r\nohne  eigentliches  Interesse  an  dem  Gegenstande  zu  fin- \r\nden, aussprach  und  behauptete. \r\n\r\nViel  schlimmer  aber  war  es,  wenn  Dante  zur  Sprache \r\nkam.  Ein  junger  Mann  von  Stande  und  Geist  und  wirk- \r\nlichem Anteil  an  jenem  außerordentlichen  Manne  nahm \r\nmeinen  Beifall  und  Billigung  nicht  zum  besten  auf,  in- \r\ndem er  ganz  unbewunden  versicherte,  jeder  Ausländer \r\nmüsse  Verzicht  tun  auf  das  Verständnis  eines  so  außer- \r\nordentlichen Geistes,  dem  ja  selbst  die  Italiener  nicht  in \r\nallem  folgen  könnten.  Nach  einigen  Hin-  und  Wider- \r\nreden verdroß  es  mich  denn  doch  zuletzt,  und  ich  sagte, \r\nich  müsse  bekennen,  daß  ich  geneigt  sei,  seinen  Äuße- \r\nrungen Beifall  zu  geben;  denn  ich  habe  nie  begreifen \r\nkönnen,  wie  man  sich  mit  diesen  Gedichten  beschäftigen \r\nmöge.  Mir  komme  die  Hölle  ganz  abscheulich  vor,  das \r\nFegefeuer  zweideutig  und  das  Paradies  langweilig;  wo- \r\nmit er  sehr  zufrieden  war,  indem  er  daraus  ein  Argument \r\nfür  seine  Behauptung  zog:  dies  eben  beweise,  daß  ich \r\nnicht  die  Tiefe  und  Höhe  dieser  Gedichte  zum  Verständ- \r\nnis bringen  könne.  Wir  schieden  als  die  besten  Freunde; \r\ner  versprach  mir  sogar,  einige  schwere  Stellen,  über  die \r\ner  lange  nachgedacht  und  über  deren  Sinn   er  endlich \r\n\r\n\r\n404  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nmit  sich  einig  geworden  sei,  mitzuteilen  und  zu  er- \r\nklären. \r\n\r\nLeider  war  die  Unterhaltung  mit  Künstlern  und  Kunst- \r\nfreunden nicht  erbaulicher.  Man  verzieh  jedoch  endlich \r\nandern  den  Fehler,  den  man  an  sich  bekennen  mußte. \r\nBald  war  es  Raffael,  bald  Michel  Angelo,  dem  man  den \r\nVorzug  gab,  woraus  denn  am  Schluß  nur  hervorging,  der \r\nMensch  sei  ein  so  beschränktes  Wesen,  daß,  wenn  sein \r\nGeist  sich  auch  dem  Großen  geöfthet  habe,  er  doch  nie- \r\nmals die  Großheiten  verschiedener  Art  ebenmäßig  zu \r\nwürdigen  und  anzuerkennen  Fähigkeit  erlange. \r\n\r\nWenn  wir  Tischbeins  Gegenwart  und  Einfluß  vermißten, \r\nso  hielt  er  uns  dagegen  durch  sehr  lebendige  Briefe  mög- \r\nlichst schadlos.  Außer  manchen  geistreich  aufgefaßten \r\nwunderlichen  Vorfällen  und  genialen  Ansichten  erfuhren \r\nwir  das  Nähere  durch  Zeichnung  und  Skizze  von  einem \r\nGemälde,  mit  welchem  er  sich  daselbst  hervortat.  In \r\nhalben  Figuren  sah  man  darauf  Oresten,  wie  er  am  Opfer- \r\naltar von  Iphigenien  erkannt  wird  und  die  ihn  bisher \r\nverfolgenden  Furien  soeben  entweichen.  Iphigenie  war \r\ndas  wohlgetroftene  Bildnis  der  Lady  Hamilton,  welche \r\ndamals  auf  dem  höchsten  Gipfel  der  Schönheit  und  des \r\nAnsehens  glänzte.  Auch  eine  der  Furien  war  durch  die \r\nÄhnlichkeit  mit  ihr  veredelt,  wie  sie  denn  überhaupt  als \r\nTypus  für  alle  Heroinen,  Musen  und  Halbgöttinnen  gel- \r\nten mußte.  Ein  Künstler,  der  dergleichen  vermochte, \r\nwar  in  dem  bedeutenden  geselligen  Kreise  eines  Ritter \r\nHamilton  sehr  wohl  aufgenommen. \r\n\r\nAugust \r\nKo)-rc$pondcnz \r\n\r\nDen  I.  Anfällst. \r\nDen  ganzen  Tag  fleißig  und  still  wegen  der  Hitze.  Meine \r\nbeste  Freude  bei  der  großen  Wärme  ist  die  Überzeugung, \r\ndaß  ihr  auch  einen  guten  Sommer  in  Deutschland  haben \r\nwerdet.  Hier  das  Heu  einführen  zu  sehen,  ist  die  größte \r\nLust,  da  es  in  dieser  Zeit  gar  nicht  regnet  und  so  der \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  405 \r\n\r\nFeldbau  nach  Willkür  behandelt  werden  kann,  wenn  sie \r\nnur  Feldbau  hätten. \r\n\r\nx\\bends  ward  in  der  Tiber  gebadet,  in  wohlangelegten \r\nsichern  Badhäuschen;  dann  auf  Trinitä  de'  Monti  spaziert \r\nund  frische  Luft  im  Mondschein  genossen.  Die  Mond- \r\nscheine sind  hier,  wie  man  sich  sie  denkt  oder  fabelt. \r\nDer  vierte  Akt  von  Egmont  ist  fertig;  im  nächsten  Brief \r\nhoff  ich  dir  den  Schluß  des  Stückes  anzukündigen. \r\n\r\nDen  II.  August. \r\nIch  bleibe  noch  bis  künftige  Ostern  in  Italien.  Ich  kann \r\njetzt  nicht  aus  der  Lehre  laufen.  Wenn  ich  aushalte, \r\nkomme  ich  gewiß  so  weit,  daß  ich  meinen  Freunden  mit \r\nmir  Freude  machen  kann.  Ihr  sollt  immer  Briefe  von  mir \r\nhaben,  meine  Schriften  kommen  nach  und  nach:  so  habt \r\nilir  den  Begriff  von  mir  als  eines  abwesend  Lebenden, \r\nda  ihr  mich  so  oft  als  einen  gegenwärtig  Toten  bedauert \r\nhabt. \r\n\r\nEgmont  ist  fertig  und  wird  zu  Ende  dieses  Monats  ab- \r\ngehen können.  Alsdann  erwarte  ich  mit  Schmerzen  euer \r\nUrteil. \r\n\r\nKein  Tag  vergeht,  daß  ich  nicht  in  Kenntnis  und  Aus- \r\nübung der  Kunst  zunehme.  Wie  eine  Flasche  sich  leicht \r\nfüllt,  die  man  oben  often  unter  das  Wasser  stößt,  so  kann \r\nman  hier  leicht  sich  ausfüllen,  wenn  man  empfänglich \r\nund  bereitet  ist;  es  drängt  das  Kunstelement  von  allen \r\nSeiten  zu. \r\n\r\nDen  guten  Sommer,  den  ihr  habt,  konnte  ich  hier  vor- \r\naussagen. Wir  haben  ganz  gleichen  reinen  Himmel  und \r\nam  hohen  Tag  entsetzliche  Hitze,  der  ich  in  meinem \r\nkühlen  Saale  ziemlich  entgehe.  September  und  Oktober \r\nwill  ich  auf  dem  Lande  zubringen  und  nach  der  Natur \r\nzeichnen.  Vielleicht  geh  ich  wieder  nach  Neapel,  um \r\nHackerts  Unterricht  zu  genießen.  Er  hat  mich  in  vier- \r\nzehn Tagen,  die  ich  mit  ihm  auf  dem  Lande  war,  weiter \r\ngebracht,  als  ich  in  Jahren  für  mich  würde  vorgerückt \r\nsein.  Noch  schicke  ich  dir  nichts  und  halte  ein  Dutzend \r\nkleine  Skizzchen  zurück,  um  dir  auf  einmal  etwas  Gutes \r\nzu  senden. \r\n\r\n\r\n4o6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDiese  Woche  ist  still  und  fleißig  hingegangen.  Beson- \r\nders hab  ich  in  der  Perspektiv  manches  gelernt.  Ver- \r\nschaftelt,  ein  Sohn  des  Mannheimer  Direktors,  hat  die.se \r\nLehre  recht  durchgedacht  und  teilt  mir  seine  Kunststücke \r\nmit.  Auch  sind  einige  Mondscheine  aufs  Brett  gekommen \r\nund  ausgetuscht  worden,  nebst  einigen  andern  Ideen,  die \r\nfast  zu  toll  sind,  als  daß  man  sie  mitteilen  sollte. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  der  Herzogin  einen  langen  Brief  geschrieben \r\nund  ihr  geraten,  die  Reise  nach  Italien  noch  ein  Jahr \r\nzu  verschieben.  Geht  sie  im  Oktober,  so  kommt  sie  ge- \r\nrade zur  Zeit  in  dies  schöne  Land,  wenn  sich  das  Wetter \r\numkehrt,  und  sie  hat  einen  bösen  Spaß.  Folgt  sie  mir  in \r\ndiesem  und  andrem,  so  kann  sie  Freude  haben,  wenn  das \r\nGlück  gut  ist.  Ich  gönne  ihr  herzlich  diese  Reise. \r\nEs  ist  sowohl  für  mich  als  für  andere  gesorgt,  und  die \r\nZukunft  wollen  wir  geruhig  erwarten.  Niemand  kann \r\nsich  umprägen  und  niemand  seinem  Schicksale  entgehn. \r\nAus  eben  diesem  Briefe  wirst  du  meinen  Plan  sehn  und \r\nihn  hoftentlich  billigen.  Ich  wiederhole  hier  nichts. \r\nIch  werde  oft  schreiben  und  den  Winter  durch  immer \r\nim  Geiste  unter  euch  sein.  Tasso  kommt  nach  dem  neuen \r\nJahre.  Faust  soll  auf  seinem  Mantel  als  Kurier  meine \r\nAnkunft  melden.  Ich  habe  alsdann  eine  Hauptepoche \r\nzurückgelegt,  rein  geendigt  und  kann  wieder  anfangen  vmd \r\neingreifen,  wo  es  nötig  ist.  Ich  fühle  mir  einen  leichtern \r\nSinn  und  bin  fast  ein  andrer  Mensch  als  vorm  Jahr. \r\nIch  lebe  in  Reichtum  und  Überfluß  alles  dessen,  was \r\nmir  eigens  lieb  und  wert  ist,  und  habe  erst  diese  paar \r\nMonate  meine  Zeit  hier  recht  genossen.  Denn  es  legt \r\nsich  nun  auseinander,  und  die  Kunst  wird  mir  wie  eine \r\nzweite  Natur,  die,  gleich  der  Minerva  aus  dem  Haupte \r\nJupiters,  so  aus  dem  Haupte  der  größten  Menschen  ge- \r\nboren worden.  Davon  sollt  ihr  in  der  Folge  tagelang, \r\nwohl  jahrelang  unterhalten  werden. \r\n\r\nIch  wünsche  euch  allen  einen  guten  September.  Am \r\nEnde  Augusts,  wo  alle  unsre  Geburtstage  zusammen- \r\ntreffen, will  ich  eurer  fleißig  gedenken.  Wie  die  Hitze  ab- \r\nnimmt, geh  ich  aufs  Land,   dort   zu  zeichnen;    indes  tu \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  407 \r\n\r\nich,  was  in  der  Stube  zu  tun  ist,  und  muß  oft  pausieren. \r\nAbends  besonders  muß  man  sich  vor  Verkältung  in  acht \r\nnehmen. \r\n\r\nDen  18.  August. \r\nDiese  Woche  hab  ich  einigermaßen  von  meiner  nordi- \r\nschen Geschäftigkeit  nachlassen  müssen;  die  ersten  Tage \r\nwaren  gar  zu  heiß.  Ich  habe  also  nicht  so  viel  getan, \r\nals  ich  wünschte.  Nun  haben  wir  seit  zwei  Tagen  die \r\nschönste  Tramontane  und  eine  gar  freie  Luft.  Septem- \r\nber und  Oktober  müssen  ein  paar  himmlische  Monate \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nGestern  fuhr  ich  vor  Sonnenaufgang  nach  Acqua  ace- \r\ntosa;  es  ist  wirklich  zum  Närrischwerden,  wenn  man  die \r\nKlarheit,  die  Mannigfaltigkeit,  duftige  Durchsichtigkeit \r\nund  himmlische  Färbung  der  Landschaft,  besonders  der \r\nFernen,  ansieht. \r\n\r\nMoritz  studiert  jetzt  die  Antiquitäten  und  wird  sie  zum \r\nGebrauch  der  Jugend  und  zum  Gebrauch  eines  jeden \r\nDenkenden  vermenschlichen  und  von  allem  Büchermoder \r\nund  Schulstaub  reinigen.  Er  hat  eine  gar  glückliche \r\nrichtige  Art,  die  Sachen  anzusehn;  ich  hoffe,  daß  er  sich \r\nauch  Zeit  nehmen  wird,  gründlich  zu  sein.  Wir  gehen \r\ndes  Abends  spazieren,  und  er  erzählt  mir,  welchen  Teil \r\ner  des  Tags  durchgedacht,  was  er  in  den  Autoren  ge- \r\nlesen; und  so  füllt  sich  auch  diese  Lücke  aus,  die  ich  bei \r\nmeinen  übrigen  Beschäftigimgen  lassen  müßte  und  nur \r\nspät  und  mit  Mühe  nachholen  könnte.  Ich  sehe  indes \r\nGebäude,  Straßen,  Gegend,  Monumente  an,  und  wenn \r\nich  abends  nach  Hause  komme,  wird  ein  Bild,  das  mir \r\nbesonders  aufgefallen,  unterm  Plaudern  aufs  Papier  ge- \r\nscherzt. Ich  lege  dir  eine  solche  Skizze  von  gestern \r\nabend  bei.  Es  ist  die  ungefähre  Idee,  wenn  man  von \r\nhinten  das  Kapitol  heraufkommt. \r\n\r\nMit  der  guten  Angelica  war  ich  Sonntags,  die  Gemälde \r\ndes  Prinzen  Aldobrandini,  besonders  einen  trefflichen \r\nLeonard  da  Vinci,  zu  sehen.  Sie  ist  nicht  glücklich, \r\nwie  sie  es  zu  sein  verdiente,  bei  dem  wirklich  großen \r\nTalent  und  bei  dem  Vermögen,   das  sich  täglich  mehrt. \r\n\r\n\r\n4o8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nSie  ist  müde,  auf  den  Kauf  zu  malen,  und  doch  findet \r\nihr  alter  Gatte  es  gar  zu  schön,  daß  so  schweres  Geld \r\nfür  oft  leichte  Arbeit  einkommt.  Sie  möchte  nun,  sich \r\nselbst  zur  Freude,  mit  mehr  Muße,  Sorgfalt  und  Studium \r\narbeiten,  und  könnte  es.  Sie  haben  keine  Kinder,  können \r\nihre  Interessen  nicht  verzehren,  und  sie  verdient  täglich \r\nauch  mit  mäßiger  Arbeit  noch  genug  hinzu.  Das  ist  nun \r\naber  nicht  und  wird  nicht.  Sie  spricht  sehr  aufrichtig \r\nmit  mir;  ich  hab  ihr  meine  Meinung  gesagt,  hab  ihr \r\nmeinen  Rat  gegeben  und  muntre  sie  auf,  wenn  ich  bei \r\nihr  bin.  Man  rede  von  Mangel  und  Unglück,  wenn  die, \r\nwelche  genug  besitzen,  es  nicht  brauchen  und  genießen \r\nkönnen!  Sie  hat  ein  unglaubliches  und  als  Weib  wirk- \r\nlich ungeheures  Talent.  Man  muß  sehen  und  schätzen, \r\nwas  sie  i?iackt,  nicht  das,  was  sie  zurückläßt.  Wie  vieler \r\nKünstler  Arbeiten  halten  Stich,  wenn  man  rechnen  will, \r\nwas  fehlt. \r\n\r\nUnd  so,  meine  Lieben,  wird  mir  Rom,  das  römische \r\nWesen,  Kunst  und  Künstler  immer  bekannter,  und  ich \r\nsehe  die  Verhältnisse  ein;  sie  werden  mir  nah  und  natür- \r\nlich, durchs  Mitleben  und  Hin-  und  Herwandeln.  Jeder \r\nbloße  Besuch  gibt  falsche  Begriffe.  Sie  möchten  mich \r\nauch  hier  aus  meiner  Stille  und  Ordnung  bringen  und  in \r\ndie  Welt  ziehen;  ich  wahre  mich,  so  gut  ich  kann — ver- \r\nspreche, verzögre,  weiche  aus,  verspreche  wieder  und \r\nspiele  den  Italiener  mit  den  Italienern.  Der  Kardinal \r\nStaatssekretär  Buoncompagni  hat  mir  es  gar  zu  nahe  legen \r\nlassen;  ich  werde  aber  ausweichen,  bis  ich  halb  Septem- \r\nber aufs  Land  gehe.  Ich  scheue  mich  vor  den  Herren \r\nund  Damen  wie  vor  einer  bösen  Krankheit;  es  wird  mir \r\nschon  weh,  wenn  ich  sie  fahren  sehe. \r\n\r\nDen  23.  August. \r\nEuren  lieben  Brief  Nr.  24  erhielt  ich  vorgestern,  eben \r\nals  ich  nach  dem  Vatikan  ging^  und  habe  ihn  unterwegs \r\nund  in  der  Si.xtinischen  Kapelle  aber-  und  abermals  ge- \r\nlesen, so  oft  ich  ausruhte  von  dem  Sehen  und  Aufmerken. \r\nIch  kann  euch  nicht  ausdrücken,  wie  sehr  ich  euch  zu \r\nmir  gewünscht  habe,  damit  ihr  nur  einen  Begriff  hättet, \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  409 \r\n\r\nwas  ein  einziger  und  ganzer  Mensch  machen  und  aus- \r\nrichten kann;  ohne  die  Sixtinische  Kapelle  gesehen  zu \r\nhaben,  kann  man  sich  keinen  anschauenden  Begriff  machen, \r\nwas  ein  Mensch  vermag.  Man  hört  und  liest  von  viel \r\ngroßen  und  braven  Leuten,  aber  hier  hat  man  es  noch \r\nganz  lebendig  über  dem  Haupte,  vor  den  Augen.  Ich \r\nhabe  mich  viel  mit  euch  unterhalten  und  wollte,  es  stünde \r\nalles  auf  dem  Blatte.  Ihr  wollt  von  mir  wissen!  Wie \r\nvieles  könnt  ich  sagen!  denn  ich  bin  wirklich  umgeboren \r\nund  erneuert  und  ausgefüllt.  Ich  fühle,  daß  sich  die \r\nSumme  meiner  Kräfte  zusammenschließt,  und  hoffe  noch \r\netwas  zu  tun.  Über  Landschaft  und  Architektur  habe  ich \r\ndiese  Zeit  her  ernstlich  nachgedacht,  auch  einiges  ver- \r\nsucht und  sehe  nun,  wo  es  damit  hinaus  will,  auch  wie \r\nweit  es  zu  bringen  wäre. \r\n\r\nNun  hat  mich  zuletzt  das  A  und  O  aller  uns  bekannten \r\nDinge,  die  menschliche  Figur,  angefaßt,  und  ich  sie,  und \r\nich  sage:  Herr,  ich  lasse  dich  nicht,  du  segnest  mich \r\ndenn,  und  sollt  ich  mich  lahm  ringen.  Mit  dem  Zeichnen \r\ngehl  es  gar  nicht,  und  ich  habe  also  mich  zum  Model- \r\nlieren entschlossen,  und  das  scheint  rücken  zu  wollen. \r\nWenigstens  bin  ich  auf  einen  Gedanken  gekommen,  der \r\nmir  vieles  erleichtert.  Es  wäre  zu  weitläufig,  es  zu  de- \r\ntaillieren, und  es  ist  besser,  zu  tun  als  zu  reden.  Genug, \r\nes  läuft  darauf  hinaus,  daß  mich  nun  mein  hartnäckig \r\nStudium  der  Natur,  meine  Sorgfalt,  mit  der  ich  in  der \r\nkomparierenden  Anatomie  zu  Werke  gegangen  bin,  nun- \r\nmehr in  den  Stand  setzen,  in  der  Natur  und  den  Antiken \r\nmanches  im  ganzen  zu  sehen,  was  den  Künstlern  im  ein- \r\nzelnen aufzusuchen  schwer  wird  und  das  sie,  wenn  sie  es \r\nendlich  erlangen,  nur  für  sich  besitzen  und  andern  nicht \r\nmitteilen  können. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  alle  meine  physiognomischen  Kunststückchen, \r\ndie  ich  aus  Pik  auf  den  Propheten  in  den  Winkel  gewor- \r\nfen, wieder  hervorgesucht,  und  sie  kommen  mir  gut  zu \r\npasse.  Ein  Herkuleskopf  ist  angefangen;  wenn  dieser \r\nglückt,  wollen  wir  weiter  gehen. \r\n\r\nSo  entfernt  bin  ich  jetzt  von  der  Welt  und  allen  welt- \r\nlichen Dingen;  es  kommt  mir  recht  wunderbar  vor,  wenn \r\n\r\n\r\n41  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  HI \r\n\r\nich  eine  Zeitung  lese.  Die  Gestalt  dieser  Welt  vergeht; \r\nich  möchte  mich  nur  mit  dem  beschäftigen,  was  bleibende \r\nVerhältnisse  sind,  und  so  nach  der  Lehre  des  ffl  meinem \r\nGeiste  erst  die  Ewigkeit  verschaffen. \r\nGestern  sah  ich  bei  Chevalier  von  Worthley,  der  eine \r\nReise  nach  Griechenland,  Ägypten  usw.  gemacht  hat, \r\nviele  Zeichnungen.  Was  mich  am  meisten  interessierte, \r\nwaren  Zeichnungen  nach  Basreliefs,  welche  im  Fries  des \r\nTempels  der  Minerva  zu  Athen  sind,  Arbeiten  des  Phi- \r\ndias.  Man  kann  sich  nichts  Schöneres  denken  als  die \r\nwenigen  einfachen  Figuren.  Übrigens  war  wenig  Rei- \r\nzendes an  den  vielen  gezeichneten  Gegenständen;  die \r\nGegenden  waren  nicht  glücklich,  die  Architektur  besser. \r\nLebe  wohl  für  heute.  Es  wird  meine  Büste  gemacht,  und \r\ndas  hat  mir  drei  Morgen  dieser  Woche  genommen. \r\n\r\nDen  28.  August. \r\nMir  ist  diese  Tage  manches  Gute  begegnet,  und  heute \r\nzum  Feste  kam  mir  Herders  Büchlein  voll  würdiger \r\nGottesgedanken.  Es  war  mir  tröstlich  und  erquicklich, \r\nsie  in  diesem  Babel,  der  Mutter  so  vieles  Betrugs  und \r\nIrrtums,  so  rein  und  schön  zu  lesen  und  zu  denken,  daß \r\ndoch  jetzt  die  Zeit  ist,  wo  sich  solche  Gesinnungen,  solche \r\nDenkarten  verbreiten  können  und  dürfen.  Ich  werde  das \r\nBüchlein  in  meiner  Einsamkeit  noch  oft  lesen  und  beher- \r\nzigen, auch  Anmerkungen  dazu  machen,  welche  Anlaß  zu \r\nkünftigen  Unterredungen  geben  können. \r\nIch  habe  diese  Tage  immer  weiter  um  mich  gegriften  in \r\nBetrachtung  der  Kunst  und  übersehe  nun  fast  das  ganze \r\nPensum,  das  mir  zu  absolvieren  bleibt;  und  wenn  es  ab- \r\nsolviert ist,  ist  noch  nichts  getan.  Vielleicht  gibts  an- \r\ndern Anlaß,  dasjenige  leichter  und  besser  zu  tun,  wozu \r\nTalen*  und  Geschick  bestimmt. \r\n\r\nDie  französische  Akademie  hat  ihre  Arbeiten  ausgestellt, \r\nes  sind  interessante  Sachen  drunter.  Pindar,  der  die \r\nGötter  um  ein  glückliches  Ende  bittet,  fällt  in  die  Arme \r\neines  Knaben,  den  er  sehr  liebt,  und  stirbt.  Es  ist  viel \r\nVerdienst  in  dem  Bilde.  Ein  Architekt  hat  eine  gar  artige \r\nIdee  ausgeführt:  er  hat  das  jetzige  Rom  von  einer  Seite \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  411 \r\n\r\ngezeichnet,  wo  es  sich  mit  allen  seinen  Teilen  gut  aus- \r\nnimmt. Dann  hat  er  auf  einem  andern  Blatte  das  alte \r\nRom  vorgestellt,  als  wenn  man  es  aus  demselben  Stand- \r\npunkt sähe.  Die  Orte,  wo  die  alten  Monumente  gestan- \r\nden, weiß  man,  ihre  Form  auch  meistens,  von  vielen \r\nstehen  noch  die  Ruinen.  Nun  hat  er  alles  Neue  weg- \r\ngetan und  das  Alte  wiederhergestellt,  wie  es  etwa  zu \r\nZeiten  Diocletians  ausgesehen  haben  mag,  und  mit  eben- \r\nsoviel Geschmack  als  Studium  und  allerliebst  gefärbt. \r\nWas  ich  tun  kann,  tu  ich  und  häufe  so  viel  von  allen  diesen \r\nBegriffen  und  Talenten  auf  mich,  als  ich  schleppen  kann, \r\nund  bringe  auf  diese  Weise  doch  das  Reellste  mit. \r\nHab  ich  dir  schon  gesagt,  daß  Trippel  meine  Büste  ar- \r\nbeitet? Der  Fürst  von  Waldeck  hat  sie  bei  ihm  bestellt. \r\nEr  ist  schon  meist  fertig,  und  es  macht  ein  gutes  Ganze. \r\nSie  ist  in  einem  sehr  soliden  Stil  gearbeitet.  Wenn  das \r\nModell  fertig  ist,  wird  er  eine  Gipsform  darüber  machen \r\nund  dann  gleich  den  Marmor  anfangen,  welchen  er  dann \r\nzuletzt  nach  dem  Leben  auszuarbeiten  wünscht;  denn  was \r\nsich  in  dieser  Materie  tun  läßt,  kann  man  in  keiner  an- \r\ndern erreichen. \r\n\r\nAngelica  malt  jetzt  ein  Bild,  das  sehr  glücken  wird:  die \r\nMutter  der  Gracchen,  wie  sie  einer  Freundin,  welche  ihre \r\nJuwelen  auskramte,  ihre  Kinder  als  die  besten  Schätze \r\nzeigt.  Es  ist  eine  natürliche  und  sehr  glückliche  Kom- \r\nposition. \r\n\r\nWie  schön  ist  es,  zu  säen,  damit  geerntet  werde!  Ich \r\nhabe  hier  durchaus  verschwiegen,  daß  heute  mein  Ge- \r\nburtstag sei,  und  dachte  beim  Aufstehen:  sollte  mir \r\ndenn  von  Hause  nichts  zur  Feier  kommen?  Und  siehe, \r\nda  wird  mir  euer  Paket  gebracht,  das  mich  unsäglich  er- \r\nfreut. Gleich  setzte  ich  mich  hin,  es  zu  lesen,  und  bin \r\nnun  zu  Ende  und  schreibe  gleich  meinen  herzlichsten \r\nDank  nieder. \r\n\r\nNun  möchte  ich  denn  erst  bei  euch  sein,  da  sollte  es  an \r\nein  Gespräch  gehen  zu  Ausführung  einiger  angedeuteten \r\nPunkte.  Genug,  das  wird  uns  auch  werden,  und  ich \r\ndanke  herzlich,  daß  eine  Säule  gesetzt  ist,  von  welcher \r\nan  wir  nun   unsre  Meilen  zählen  können.     Ich  wandle \r\n\r\n\r\n4 1 2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nstarken  Schrittes  in  den  Gefilden  der  Natur  und  Kunst \r\nherum  und  werde  dir  mit  Freuden  von  da  aus  entgegen- \r\nkommen. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  es  heute,  nach  Empfang  deines  Briefes,  noch \r\neinmal  durchgedacht  und  muß  darauf  beharren:  mein \r\nKunststudium,  mein  Autorwesen,  alles  fordert  noch  diese \r\nZeit.  In  der  Kunst  muß  ich  es  so  weit  bringen,  daß  alles \r\nanschauende  Kenntnis  werde,  nichts  Tradition  und  Name \r\nbleibe,  und  ich  zwinge  es  in  diesem  halben  Jahre;  auch \r\nist  es  nirgends  als  in  Rom  zu  zwingen.  Meine  Sächelchen \r\n— denn  sie  kommen  mir  sehr  im  Deminutiv  vor — muß \r\nich  wenigstens  mit  Sammlung  und  Freudigkeit  enden. \r\nDann  zieht  mich  alles  nach  dem  Vaterlande  zurück.  Und \r\nwenn  ich  auch  ein  isoliertes,  privates  Leben  führen  sollte, \r\nhabe  ich  so  viel  nachzuholen  und  zu  vereinigen,  daß  ich \r\nfür  zehn  Jahre  keine  Ruhe  sehe. \r\n\r\nIn  der  Naturgeschichte  bring  ich  dir  Sachen  mit,  die  du \r\nnicht  erwartest.  Ich  glaube  dem  Wie  der  Organisation \r\nsehr  nahe  zu  rücken.  Du  sollst  diese  Manifestationen \r\n—  nicht  Fulgurationen — unsres  Gottes  mit  Freuden \r\nbeschauen  und  mich  belehren,  wer  in  der  alten  und \r\nneuen  Zeit  dasselbe  gefunden,  gedacht,  es  von  eben  der \r\nSeite  oder  aus  einem  wenig  abweichenden  Standpunkte \r\nbetrachtet. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nAugust \r\nZu  Anfang  dieses  Monats  reifte  bei  mir  der  Vorsatz,  noch \r\nden  nächsten  Winter  in  Rom  zu  bleiben;  Gefühl  und \r\nEinsicht,  daß  ich  aus  diesem  Zustande  noch  völlig  unreif \r\nmich  entfernen,  auch  daß  ich  nirgends  solchen  Raum \r\nund  solche  Ruhe  für  den  Abschluß  meiner  Werke  finden \r\nwürde,  bestimmten  mich  endlich;  und  nun,  als  ich  sol- \r\nches nach  Hause  gemeldet  hatte,  begann  ein  Zeitraum \r\nneuer  Art. \r\n\r\nDie  große  Hitze,  welche  sich  nach  und  nach  steigerte \r\nund  einer  allzuraschen  Tätigkeit  Ziel  und  Maß  gab,  machte \r\nsolche  Räume  angenehm  und  wtuischenswert,  wo  man \r\nseine  Zeit  nützlich  in  Ruh  und  Kühlung  zubringen  konnte. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  413 \r\n\r\nDie  Sixtinische  Kapelle  gab  hiezu  die  schönste  Gelegen- \r\nheit. Gerade  zu  dieser  Zeit  hatte  Michel  Angelo  aufs \r\nneue  die  Verehrung  der  Künstler  gewonnen;  neben  seinen \r\nübrigen  großen  Eigenschaften  sollt  er  sogar  auch  im \r\nKolorit  nicht  übertreffen  worden  sein,  und  es  wurde \r\nMode,  zu  streiten,  ob  er  oder  Rafiael  mehr  Genie  gehabt. \r\nDie  Transfiguration  des  letzteren  wurde  mitunter  sehr \r\nstrenge  getadelt  und  die  Disputa  das  beste  seiner  Werke \r\ngenannt;  wodurch  sich  denn  schon  die  später  aufgekom- \r\nmene Vorliebe  für  Werke  der  alten  Schule  ankündigte, \r\nwelche  der  stille  Beobachter  nur  für  ein  Symptom  halber \r\nund  unfreier  Talente  betrachten  und  sich  niemals  damit \r\nbefreunden  konnte. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  so  schwer,  ein  großes  Talent  zu  fassen,  geschweige \r\ndenn  zwei  zugleich.  Wir  erleichtern  uns  dieses  durch \r\nParteilichkeit;  deshalb  denn  die  Schätzung  von  Künstlern \r\nund  Schriftstellern  immer  schwankt  und  einer  oder  der \r\nandere  immer  ausschließlich  den  Tag  beherrscht.  ]\\Iich \r\nkonnten  dergleichen  Streitigkeiten  nicht  irre  machen,  da \r\nich  sie  auf  sich  beruhen  ließ  und  mich  mit  unmittelbarer \r\nBetrachtung  alles  Werten  und  Würdigen  beschäftigte. \r\nDiese  Vorliebe  für  den  großen  Florentiner  teilte  sich \r\nvon  den  Künstlern  gar  bald  auch  den  Liebhabern  mit, \r\nda  denn  auch  gerade  zu  jener  Zeit  Bury  und  Lips \r\nAquarellkopien  in  der  Sixtinischen  Kapelle  für  Grafen \r\nFrieß  zu  fertigen  hatten.  Der  Kustode  ward  gut  bezahlt; \r\ner  ließ  uns  durch  die  Hintertür  neben  dem  Altar  hinein, \r\nund  wir  hauseten  darin  nach  Belieben.  Es  fehlte  nicht \r\nan  einiger  Nahrung,  und  ich  erinnere  mich,  ermüdet  von \r\ngroßer  Tageshitze,  auf  dem  päpstlichen  Stuhle  einem \r\nMittagsschlaf  nachgegeben  zu  haben. \r\nSorgfältige  Durchzeichnungen  der  unteren  Köpfe  und \r\nFiguren  des  Altarbildes,  die  man  mit  der  Leiter  erreichen \r\nkonnte,  wurden  gefertigt,  erst  mit  weißer  Kreide  auf \r\nschwarze  Florrahmen,  dann  mit  Rötel  auf  große  Papier- \r\nbogen durchgezeichnet. \r\n\r\nEbnermaßen  ward  denn  auch,  indem  man  sich  nach  dem \r\nAltern  hinwendete,  Leonard  da  Vinci  berühmt,  dessen \r\nhochgeschätztes  Bild,  Christus  unter  den  Pharisäern,  in \r\n\r\n\r\n414  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nder  Galerie  Aldobrandini  ich  mit  Angelica  besuchte.  Es \r\nwar  herkömmlich  geworden,  daß  sie  Sonntag  um  Mittag \r\nmit  ihrem  Gemahl  und  Rat  Reiftenstein  bei  mir  vorfuhr \r\nund  wir  sodann  mit  möglichster  Gemütsruhe  uns  durch \r\neine  Backofenhitze  in  irgend  eine  Sammlung  begaben, \r\ndort  einige  Stunden  verweilten  und  sodann  zu  einer \r\nwohlbesetzten  Mittagstafel  bei  ihr  einkehrten.  Es  war \r\nvorzüglich  belehrend,  mit  diesen  drei  Personen,  deren \r\neine  jede  in  ihrer  Art  theoretisch,  praktisch,  ästhetisch \r\nund  technisch  gebildet  war,  sich  in  Gegenwart  so  bedeu- \r\ntender Kunstwerke  zu  besprechen. \r\n\r\nRitter  Worthley,  der  aus  Griechenland  zurückgekommen \r\nwar,  ließ  uns  wohlwollend  seine  mitgebrachten  Zeich- \r\nnungen sehen,  unter  welchen  die  Nachbildungen  der \r\nArbeiten  des  Phidias  im  Fronton  der  Akropolis  einen \r\nentschiedenen  und  unauslöschlichen  Eindruck  in  mir  zu- \r\nrückließen, der  um  desto  starker  war,  als  ich,  durch  die \r\nmächtigen  Gestalten  des  Michel  Angelo  veranlaßt,  dem \r\nmenschlichen  Körper  mehr  als  bi.sher  Aufmerksamkeit \r\nund  Studium  zugewendet  hatte. \r\n\r\nEine  bedeutende  Epoche  jedoch  in  dem  regsamen  Kunst- \r\nleben machte  die  Ausstellung  der  französischen  Aka- \r\ndemie zu  Ende  des  Monats.  Durch  Davids  Horatier \r\nhatte  sich  das  Übergewicht  auf  die  Seite  der  Franzosen \r\nhingeneigt.  Tischbein  wurde  dadurch  veranlaßt,  seinen \r\nHektor,  der  den  Paris  in  Gegenwart  der  Helena  auf- \r\nfordert, lebensgroß  anzufangen.  Durch  Drouais,  Gag- \r\nneraux,  des  Mards,  Gauffier,  St.  Ours  erhält  sich  nun- \r\nmehr der  Ruhm  der  Franzosen,  und  Boguet  erwirbt \r\nals  Landschaftmaler  im  Sinne  Poussins  einen  guten \r\nNamen. \r\n\r\nIndessen  hatte  Moritz  sich  um  die  alte  Mythologie  be- \r\nmüht. Er  war  nach  Rom  gekommen,  um  nach  früherer \r\nArt  durch  eine  Reisebeschreibung  sich  die  Mittel  einer \r\nReise  zu  verschaffen.  Ein  Buchhändler  hatte  ihm  Vor- \r\nschuß geleistet;  aber  bei  seinem  Aufenthalt  in  Rom  wurde \r\ner  bald  gewahr,  daß  ein  leichtes  loses  Tagebuch  nicht \r\nungestraft  verfaßt  werden  könne.  I  )urrh  tagtägliche  Ge- \r\nspräche, durch  Anschauen  so  vieler  wichtiger  Kunstwerke \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  415 \r\n\r\nregte  sich  in  ihm  der  Gedanke,  eine  Götterlehre  der  Alten \r\nin  rein  menschlichem  Sinne  zu  schreiben  und  solche  mit \r\nbelehrenden  Umrissen  nach  geschnittenen  Steinen  künftig \r\nherauszugeben.  Er  arbeitete  fleißig  daran,  und  unser \r\nVerein  ermangelte  nicht,  sich  mit  demselben  einwirkend \r\ndarüber  zu  unterhalten. \r\n\r\nEine  höchst  angenehme,  belehrende  Unterhaltung,  mit \r\nmeinen  Wünschen  und  Zwecken  unmittelbar  zusammen- \r\ntreffend, knüpfte  ich  mit  dem  Bildhauer  Trippel  in  seiner \r\nWerkstatt  an,  als  er  meine  Büste  modellierte,  welche  er \r\nfür  den  Fürsten  von  Waldeck  in  Marmor  ausarbeiten \r\nsollte.  Gerade  zum  Studium  der  menschlichen  Gestalt, \r\nund  um  über  ihre  Proportionen,  als  Kanon  und  als  ab- \r\nweichender Charakter,  aufgeklärt  zu  werden,  war  nicht \r\nwohl  unter  andern  Bedingimgen  zu  kommen.  Dieser \r\nAugenblick  ward  auch  doppelt  interessant  dadurch,  daß \r\nTrippel  von  einem  Apollokopf  Kenntnis  erhielt,  der  sich \r\nin  der  Sammlung  des  Palasts  Giustiniani  bisher  unbe- \r\nachtet befunden  hatte.  Er  hielt  denselben  für  eins  der \r\nedelsten  Kunstwerke  und  hegte  Hoffnung,  ihn  zu  kaufen, \r\nwelches  jedoch  nicht  gelang.  Diese  Antike  ist  seitdem \r\nberühmt  geworden  und  später  an  Herrn  von  Pourtales \r\nnach  Neufchatel  gekommen. \r\n\r\nAber  wie  derjenige,  der  sich  einmal  zur  See  wagt,  durch \r\nWind  und  Wetter  bestimmt  wird,  seinen  Lauf  bald  dahin \r\nbald  dorthin  zu  nehmen,  so  erging  es  auch  mir.  Ver- \r\nschaffelt eröffnete  einen  Kurs  der  Perspektive,  wo  wir  uns \r\ndes  Abends  versammelten  und  eine  zahlreiche  Gesellschaft \r\nauf  seine  Lehren  horchte  und  sie  unmittelbar  ausübte. \r\nDas  Vorzüglichste  war  dabei,  daß  man  gerade  das  Hin- \r\nreichende und  nicht  zu  viel  lernte. \r\n\r\nAus  dieser  kontemplativ  tätigen,  geschäftigen  Ruhe  hätte \r\nman  mich  gerne  herausgerissen.  Das  unglückliche  Kon- \r\nzert war  in  Rom,  wo  das  Hin-  und  Widerreden  des  Tags \r\nwie  an  kleinen  Orten  herkömmlich  ist,  vielfach  bespro- \r\nchen; man  war  auf  mich  und  meine  schriftstellerischen \r\nArbeiten  aufmerksam  geworden;  ich  hatte  die  Iphigenie \r\nund  sonstiges  unter  Freunden  vorgelesen,  worüber  man \r\nsich  gleichfalls  besprach.    Kardinal  Buoncompagni  ver- \r\n\r\n\r\n41 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  ITT \r\n\r\nlangte  mich  zu  sehen,  ich  aber  hielt  fest  in  meiner  wohl- \r\nbekannten Einsiedelei,  und  ich  konnte  dies  um  so  eher, \r\nals  Rat  Reiftenstein  fest  und  eigensinnig  behauptete,  da \r\nich  mich  durch  ihn  nicht  habe  präsentieren  lassen,  so \r\nkönne  es  kein  anderer  tun.  Dies  gereichte  mir  sehr  zum \r\nVorteil,  und  ich  benutzte  immer  sein  Ansehn,  um  mich  in \r\neinmal  gewählter  und  ausgesprochener  Abgeschiedenheit \r\nzu  erhalten. \r\n\r\nSeptember \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  I.  September. \r\nHeute,  kann  ich  sagen,  ist  Egmont  fertig  geworden;  ich \r\nhabe  diese  Zeit  her  immer  noch  hier  und  da  daran  ge- \r\narbeitet. Ich  schicke  ihn  über  Zürich;  denn  ich  wünsche, \r\ndaß  Kayser  Zwischenakte  dazu,  und  was  sonst  von  Musik \r\nnötig  ist,  komponieren  möge.  Dann  wünsch  ich  euch \r\nFreude  daran. \r\n\r\nMeine  Kunststudien  gehen  sehr  vorwärts,  mein  Prinzip \r\npaßt  überall  und  schließt  mir  alles  auf.  Alles,  was  Künst- \r\nler nur  einzeln  mühsam  zusammensuchen  müssen,  liegt \r\nnun  zusammen  often  und  frei  vor  mir.  Ich  sehe  jetzt,  wie \r\nviel  ich  nicht  weiß,  und  der  Weg  ist  offen,  alles  zu  wissen \r\nund  zu  begreifen. \r\n\r\nMoritzen  hat  Herders  Gotteslehre  sehr  wohl  getan;  er \r\nzählt  gewiß  Epoche  seines  Lebens  davon,  er  hat  sein \r\nGemüt  dahin  geneigt  und  war  durch  meinen  Umgang \r\nvorbereitet;  er  schlug  gleich  wie  wohl  getrocknet  Holz  in \r\nlichte  Flammen. \r\n\r\nDe7i  3.  September. \r\nHeute  ist  es  jährig,  daß  ich  mich  aus  Karlsbad  entfernte. \r\nWelch  ein  Jahi\"!  und  welch  eine  sonderbare  Epoche  für \r\nmich  dieser  Tag,  des  Herzogs  Geburtstag  und  ein  Ge- \r\nburtstag für  mich  zu  einem  neuen  Leben.  Wie  ich  dieses \r\nJahr  genutzt,  kann  ich  jetzt  weder  mir  noch  andern  be- \r\nrechnen; ich  hofie,  es  wird  ihe  Zeit  kommen,  die  schöne \r\nStunde,  da  ich  mit  euch  alles  werde  summieren  können. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  417 \r\n\r\nJetzt  gehn  hier  erst  meine  Studien  an,  und  ich  hätte  Rom \r\ngar  nicht  gesehen,  wenn  ich  früher  weggegangen  wäre. \r\nMan  denkt  sich  gar  nicht,  was  hier  zu  sehen  und  zu \r\nlernen  ist;  auswärts  kann  man  keinen  Begiüff  davon \r\nhaben. \r\n\r\nIch  bin  wieder  in  die  ägyptischen  Sachen  gekommen. \r\nDiese  Tage  war  ich  einigemal  bei  dem  großen  Obelisk, \r\nder  noch  zerbrochen  zwischen  Schutt  und  Kot  in  einem \r\nHofe  liegt.  Es  war  der  Obelisk  des  Sesostris,  in  Rom  zu \r\nEhren  des  Augusts  aufgerichtet,  und  stand  als  Zeiger  der \r\ngroßen  Sonnenulir,  die  auf  dem  Boden  des  Campus  Mar- \r\ntins gezeichnet  war.  Dieses  älteste  und  herrlichste  vieler \r\nMonumente  liegt  nun  da  zerbrochen,  einige  Seiten  (wahr- \r\nscheinlich durchs  Feuer)  verunstaltet.  Und  doch  liegt  es \r\nnoch  da,  und  die  unzerstörten  Seiten  sind  noch  frisch, \r\nwie  gestern  gemacht,  und  von  der  schönsten  Arbeit,  in \r\nihrer  Art.  Ich  lasse  jetzt  eine  Sphinx  der  Spitze  und  die \r\nGesichter  von  Sphinxen,  Menschen,  Vögeln  abformen  und \r\nin  Gips  gießen.  Diese  unschätzbaren  Sachen  muß  man \r\nbesitzen,  besonders  da  man  sagt,  der  Papst  wolle  ihn \r\naufrichten  lassen,  da  man  denn  die  Hieroglyphen  nicht \r\nmehr  erreichen  kann.  So  will  ich  es  auch  mit  den  besten \r\nhetrurischen  Sachen  tun  usw.  Nun  modelliere  ich  nach \r\ndiesen  Bildungen  in  Ton,  um  mir  alles  recht  eigen  zu \r\nmachen. \r\n\r\nDen  5.  Sept Ollher. \r\nIch  muß  an  einem  Morgen  schreiben,  der  ein  festlicher \r\nMorgen  für  mich  wird.  Denn  heute  ist  Egmont  eigentlich \r\nrecht  völlig  fertig  geworden.  Der  Titel  und  die  Personen \r\nsind  geschrieben  und  einige  Lücken,  die  ich  gelassen \r\nhatte,  ausgefüllt  worden;  nun  freu  ich  mich  schon  zum \r\nvoraus  auf  die  Stunde,  in  welcher  ihr  ihn  erhalten  und \r\nlesen  werdet.  Es  sollen  auch  einige  Zeichnungen  bei- \r\ngelegt werden. \r\n\r\nDen  6.  September. \r\nIch  hatte  mir  vorgenommen,  euch  recht  viel  zu  schreiben \r\nund  auf  den  letzten  Brief  allerlei  zu  sagen;  nun  bin  ich \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  27 \r\n\r\n\r\n4 1 8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nunterbrochen  worden,  und  morgen  geh  ich  nach  Frascati. \r\nDieser  Brief  muß  Sonnabends  fort,  und  nun  sag  ich  nur \r\nnoch  zum  Abschied  wenige  Worte.  Wahrscheinlich  habt \r\nihr  jetzt  auch  schönes  Wetter,  wie  wir  es  unter  diesem \r\nfreieren  Himmel  genießen.  Ich  habe  immer  neue  Ge- \r\ndanken, und  da  die  Gegenstände  um  mich  tausendfach \r\nsind,  so  wecken  sie  mich  bald  zu  dieser,  bald  zu  jener \r\nIdee.  Von  vielen  Wegen  rückt  alles  gleichsam  auf  einen \r\nPunkt  zusammen,  ja  ich  kann  sagen,  daß  ich  nun  Licht \r\nsehe,  wo  es  mit  mir  und  meinen  Fähigkeiten  hinaus  will; \r\nso  alt  muß  man  werden,  um  nur  einen  leidlichen  Begrift\" \r\nvon  seinem  Zustande  zu  haben.  Es  sind  also  die  Schwaben \r\nnicht  allein,  die  vierzig  Jahre  brauchen,  um  klug  zu  wer- \r\nden. \r\n\r\nIch  höre,  daß  Herder  nicht  wohl  ist,  und  bin  darüber \r\nin  Sorge;  ich  hofte,  bald  bessere  Nachrichten  zu  ver- \r\nnehmen. \r\n\r\nMir  geht  es  immer  an  Leib  und  Seele  gut,  und  fast  kann \r\nich  hoffen,  radikaliter  kuriert  zu  werden:  alles  geht  mir \r\nleicht  von  der  Hand,  und  manchmal  kommt  ein  Hauch \r\nder  Jugendzeit,  mich  anzuwehen.  Egmont  geht  mit  diesem \r\nBrief  ab,  wird  aber  später  kommen,  weil  ich  ihn  auf  die \r\nfahrende  Post  gebe.  Recht  neugierig  und  verlangend  bin \r\nich,  was  ihr  dazu  sagen  werdet. \r\n\r\nVielleicht  wäre  gut,  mit  dem  Druck  bald  anzufangen.  Es \r\nwürde  mich  freuen,  wenn  das  Stück  so  frisch  ins  Publi- \r\nkum käme.  Seht,  wie  ihr  das  einrichtet;  ich  will  mit  dem \r\nRest  des  Bandes  nicht  zurückbleiben. \r\nDer  \"Gott\"  leistet  mir  die  beste  Gesellschaft.  Moritz  ist \r\ndadurch  wirklich  aufgebaut  worden:  es  fehlte  gleichsam \r\nnur  an  diesem  Werke,  das  nun  als  Schlußstein  seine  Ge- \r\ndanken schließt,  die  immer  auseinanderfallen  wollten. \r\nEs  wird  recht  brav.  Mich  hat  es  aufgemuntert,  in  natür- \r\nlichen Dingen  weiter  vorzudringen,  wo  ich  denn  besonders \r\nin  der  Botanik  auf  ein  ev  xat  Trav  gekommen  bin,  das \r\nmich  in  Erstaunen  setzt;  wie  weit  es  um  sich  greift,  kann \r\nich  selbst  noch  nicht  sehn. \r\n\r\nMein  Prinzip,  die  Kunstwerke  zu  erklären  und  das  auf \r\neinmal  aufzuschließen,  woran  Künstler  und  Kenner  sich \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  419 \r\n\r\nschon  seit  der  Wiederherstellung  der  Kunst  zersuchen \r\nund  zerstudieren,  find  ich  bei  jeder  Anwendung  richtiger. \r\nEigentlich  ists  auch  ein  Kolumbisches  Ei.  Ohne  zu  sagen, \r\ndaß  ich  einen  solchen  Kapitalschlüssel  besitze,  Sprech  ich \r\nnun  die  Teile  zweckmäßig  mit  den  Künstlern  diurch  und \r\nsehe,  wie  weit  sie  gekommen  sind,  was  sie  haben  und  wo \r\nes  widerstößt.  Die  Türe  hab  ich  oöen  und  stehe  auf  der \r\nSchwelle  und  werde  leider  mich  von  da  aus  nur  im  Tempel \r\numsehen  können  und  wieder  scheiden. \r\nSo  viel  ist  gewiß,  die  alten  Künstler  haben  ebenso  große \r\nKenntnis  der  Natur  und  eben  einen  so  sichern  Begrift' \r\nvon  dem,  was  sich  vorstellen  läßt  und  wie  es  vorgestellt \r\nwerden  muß,  gehabt,  als  Homer.  Leider  ist  die  Anzahl \r\nder  Kunstwerke  der  ersten  Klasse  gar  zu  klein.  Wenn \r\nman  aber  auch  diese  sieht,  so  hat  man  nichts  zu  wünschen, \r\nals  sie  recht  zu  erkennen  und  dann  in  Friede  hinzufahren. \r\nDiese  hohen  Kunstwerke  sind  zugleich  als  die  höchsten \r\nNaturwerke  von  Menschen  nach  wahren  und  natürlichen \r\nGesetzen  hervorgebracht  worden.  Alles  Willkürliche, \r\nEingebildete  fällt  zusammen:  da  ist  die  Notwendigkeit, \r\nda  ist  Gott. \r\n\r\nIn  einigen  Tagen  werde  ich  die  Arbeiten  eines  geschickten \r\nArchitekten  sehen,  der  selbst  in  Palmyra  war  und  die \r\nGegenstände  mit  großem  Verstand  und  Geschmack  ge- \r\nzeichnet hat.  Ich  gebe  gleich  Nachricht  davon  und  er- \r\nwarte mit  Verlangen  eure  Gedanken  über  diese  wichtigen \r\nRuinen. \r\n\r\nFreut  euch  mit  mir,  daß  ich  glücklich  bin;  ja,  ich  kann \r\nwohl  sagen,  ich  war  es  nie  in  dem  Maße:  mit  der  größten \r\nRuhe  und  Reinheit  eine  eingeborne  Leidenschaft  befrie- \r\ndigen zu  können  und  von  einem  anhaltenden  Vergnügen \r\neinen  dauernden  Nutzen  sich  versprechen  zu  dürfen,  ist \r\nwohl  nichts  Geringes.  Könnte  ich  meinen  Geliebten  nur \r\netwas  von  meinem  Genuß  und  meiner  Empfindung  mit- \r\nteilen. \r\n\r\nIch  hoffe,  die  trüben  Wolken  am  politischen  Himmel  sollen \r\nsich  zerstreuen.  Unsre  modernen  Kriege  machen  viele \r\nunglücklich,  indessen  sie  dauern,  und  niemand  glücklich, \r\nwenn  sie  vorbei  sind. \r\n\r\n\r\n42 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDen  14.  September, \r\nEs  bleibt  wohl  dabei,  meine  Lieben,  daß  ich  ein  Mensch \r\nbin,  der  von  der  Mühe  lebt.  Diese  Tage  her  habe  ich \r\nwieder  mehr  gearbeitet  als  genossen.  Nun  geht  die  Woche \r\nzu  Ende,  und  ihr  sollt  ein  Blatt  haben. \r\nEs  ist  ein  Leid,  daß  die  Aloe  in  Belvedere  eben  das  Jahr \r\nmeiner  Abwesenheit  wählt,  um  zu  blühen.  In  Sizihen \r\nwar  ich  zu  früh;  hier  blüht  dies  Jahr  nur  eine,  nicht  groß, \r\nund  sie  steht  so  hoch,  daß  man  nicht  dazu  kann.  Es  ist \r\nallerdings  ein  indianisch  Gewächs,  auch  in  diesen  Gegen- \r\nden nicht  recht  zu  Hause. \r\n\r\nDes  Engländers  Beschreibungen  machen  mir  wenig  Freude. \r\nDie  GeistHchen  müssen  sich  in  England  sehr  in  acht \r\nnehmen,  dagegen  haben  sie  auch  das  übrige  Publikum  in \r\nder  Flucht.  Der  freie  Engländer  muß  in  sittlichen  Schriften \r\nsehr  eingeschränkt  einhergehn. \r\n\r\nDie  Schwanzmenschen  wundern  mich  nicht,  nach  der  Be- \r\nschreibung ist  es  etwas  sehr  Natürliches.  Es  stehen  weit \r\nwunderbarere  Sachen  täglich  vor  unsern  Augen,  die  wir \r\nnicht  achten,  weil  sie  nicht  so  nah  mit  uns  verwandt \r\nsind. \r\n\r\nDaß  B.,  wie  mehr  Menschen,  die  kein  Gefühl  echter \r\nGottesverehrung  während  ihres  Lebens  gehabt  haben,  in \r\nihrem  Alter  ßw/im  werden,  wie  mans  heißt,  ist  auch  recht \r\ngut,  wenn  man  nur  sich  nicht  mit  ihnen  erbauen  soll. \r\nEinige  Tage  war  ich  in  Frascati  mit  Rat  Reilfenstein; \r\nAngelica  kam  Sonntags,  uns  abzuholen.  Es  ist  ein  Para- \r\ndies. \r\n\r\nErwin  und  Elmire  ist  zur  Hälfte  schon  umgeschrieben. \r\nIch  habe  gesucht,  dem  Stückchen  melir  Interesse  und \r\nLeben  zu  verschaften,  und  habe  den  äußerst  platten  Dialog \r\nganz  weggeschmissen.  Es  ist  Schülerarbeit  oder  vielmehr \r\nSudelei.  Die  artigen  Gesänge,  worauf  sich  alles  dreht, \r\nbleiben  alle;  wie  natürlich. \r\n\r\nDie  Künste  werden  auch  fortgetrieben,  daß  es  saust  und \r\nbraust. \r\n\r\nMeine  Büste  ist  sehr  gut  geraten;  jedermann  ist  damit \r\nzufrieden.    Gewiß  ist  sie  in  einem  schönen  und  edlen  Stil \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  421 \r\n\r\ngearbeitet,  und  ich  habe  nichts  dagegen,  daß  die  Idee, \r\nals  hätte  ich  so  ausgesehen,  in  der  Welt  bleibt.  Sie  wird \r\nnun  gleich  in  Marmor  angefangen  und  zuletzt  auch  in  den \r\nMarmor  nach  der  Natur  gearbeitet.  Der  Transport  ist \r\nso  lästig,  sonst  schickte  ich  gleich  einen  Abguß;  vielleicht \r\neinmal  mit  einem  Schiftstransport,  denn  einige  Kisten \r\nwerd  ich  doch  zuletzt  zusammenpacken. \r\nIst  denn  Kranz  noch  nicht  angekommen,  dem  ich  eine \r\nSchachtel  für  die  Kinder  mitgab? \r\n\r\nSie  haben  jetzt  wieder  eine  gar  graziöse  Operette  auf  dem \r\nTheater  in  Valle,  nachdem  zwei  jämmerlich  verunglückt \r\nwaren.  Die  Leute  spielen  mit  viel  Lust,  und  es  harmo- \r\nniert alles  zusammen.  Nun  wird  es  bald  aufs  Land  gehen. \r\nEs  hat  einigemal  geregnet,  das  Wetter  ist  abgekühlt,  und \r\ndie  Gegend  macht  sich  wieder  grün. \r\nVon  der  großen  Eruption  des  Ätna  werden  euch  die \r\nZeitungen  gesagt  haben  oder  sagen. \r\n\r\nDen  15.  September. \r\nNun  hab  ich  auch  Trencks  Leben  gelesen;  es  ist  inter- \r\nessant genug,  und  lassen  sich  Reflexionen  genug  darüber \r\nmachen. \r\n\r\nMein  nächster  Brief  wird  meine  Bekanntschaft  mit  einem \r\nmerkwürdigen  Reisenden  erzählen,  die  ich  morgen  machen \r\nsoll. \r\n\r\nFreuet  euch  übrigens  meines  hiesigen  Aufenthalts.  Rom \r\nist  mir  nun  ganz  familiär,  und  ich  habe  fast  nichts  mehr \r\ndrin,  was  mich  überspannte.  Die  Gegenstände  haben \r\nmich  nach  und  nach  zu  sich  hinaufgehoben.  Ich  genieße \r\nimmer  reiner,  immer  mit  mehr  Kenntnis;  das  gute  Glück \r\nwird  immer  weiter  helfen. \r\n\r\nHier  liegt  ein  Blatt  bei,  das  ich  abgeschrieben  den  Freun- \r\nden mitzuteilen  bitte.  Auch  darum  ist  der  Aufenthalt  in \r\nRom  so  interessant,  weil  es  ein  Mittelpunkt  ist,  nach  dem \r\nsich  so  vieles  hinzieht.  Die  Sachen  des  Cassas  sind  außer- \r\nordentlich schön.  Ich  habe  ihm  manches  in  Gedanken \r\ngestohlen,  das  ich  euch  mitbringen  will. \r\nIch  bin  immer  fleißig.  Nun  hab  ich  ein  Köpfchen  nach \r\nGips  gezeichnet,  um  zu  sehen,  ob  mein  Prinzipium  Stich \r\n\r\n\r\n42  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nhält.  Ich  finde,  es  paßt  vollkommen  und  erleichtert  er- \r\nstaunend das  Machen.  Man  wollte  nicht  glauben,  daß \r\nichs  gemacht  habe,  und  doch  ist  es  noch  nichts.  Ich  sehe \r\nnun  wohl,  wie  weit  sichs  mit  Applikation  bringen  ließe. \r\nMontag  geht  es  wieder  nach  Frascati.  Ich  will  sorgen, \r\ndaß  doch  heute  über  acht  Tage  ein  Brief  abgehen  kann. \r\nDann  werd  ich  wohl  nach  Albano  gehen.  Es  wird  recht \r\nfleißig  nach  der  Natur  gezeichnet  werden.  Ich  mag  nun \r\nvon  gar  nichts  mehr  wissen,  als  etwas  hervorzubringen \r\nund  meinen  Sinn  recht  zu  üben.  Ich  liege  an  dieser \r\nKrankheit  von  Jugend  auf  krank,  und  gebe  Gott,  daß  sie \r\nsich  einmal  auflöse. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  September. \r\nGestern  war  eine  Prozession,  wo  sie  das  Blut  des  heiligen \r\nFranziskus  herumtrugen;  ich  spekulierte  auf  Köpfe  und \r\nGesichter,  indes  die  Reihen  von  Ordensgeistlichen  vor- \r\nbeizogen. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  mir  eine  Sammlung  von  zweihundert  der  besten \r\nAntiken -Gemmen -Abdrücke,  angeschaft't.  Es  ist  das \r\nSchönste,  was  man  von  alter  Arbeit  hat,  und  zum  Teil \r\nsind  sie  auch  wegen  der  artigen  Gedanken  gewählt.  Man \r\nkann  von  Rom  nichts  Kostbareres  mitnehmen,  besonders \r\nda  die  Abdrücke  so  außerordentlich  schön  und  scharf \r\nsind. \r\n\r\nWie  manches  Gute  werd  ich  mitbringen,  wenn  ich  mit \r\nmeinem  Schiffchen  zurückkehre;  doch  vor  allem  ein  fröh- \r\nliches Herz,  fähiger,  das  Glück,  was  mir  Liebe  und  Freund- \r\nschaft zudenkt,  zu  genießen.  Nur  muß  ich  nichts  wieder \r\nunternehmen,  was  außer  dem  Kreise  meiner  Fähigkeit \r\nliegt,  wo  ich  mich  nur  al)arbc'ite  und  niclits  fruchte. \r\n\r\nNoch  ein  Blatt,  meine  Lieben,  muß  ich  euch  mit  dieser \r\nPost  eilig  schicken.  Heute  war  mir  ein  sehr  merkwürdiger \r\nTag.  Briefe  von  vielen  Freunden,  von  der  Herzogin- \r\nMutter,  Nachricht  von  meinem  gefeierten  Geburtsfeste \r\nund  endlich  meine  Schriften. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  mir  wirklich  sonderbar  zumute,  daß  diese  vier \r\nzarten  Bändthen,  die  Resultate  eines  halben  Lebens,  mich \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  423 \r\n\r\nin  Rom  aufsuchen.  Ich  kann  wohl  sagen:  es  ist  kein \r\nBuchstabe  drin,  der  nicht  gelebt,  empfunden,  genossen, \r\ngelitten,  gedacht  wäre;  und  sie  sprechen  mich  nun  alle \r\ndesto  lebhafter  an.  Meine  Sorge  und  Hoffnung  ist,  daß \r\ndie  vier  folgenden  nicht  hinter  diesen  bleiben.  Ich  danke \r\neuch  für  alles,  was  ihr  an  diesen  Blättern  getan  habt,  tmd \r\nwünsche  euch  auch  Freude  bringen  zu  können.  Sorgt \r\nauch  für  die  folgenden  mit  treuen  Herzen. \r\nIhr  vexiert  mich  über  die  \"Provinzen\",  und  ich  gestehe, \r\nder  Ausdruck  ist  sehr  uneigentlich.  Da  kann  man  aber \r\nsehen,  wie  man  sich  in  Rom  angewöhnt,  alles  grandios \r\nzu  denken.  Wirklich  schein  ich  mich  zu  nationalisieren; \r\ndenn  man  gibt  den  Römern  schuld,  daß  sie  nur  von  cose \r\ngrosse  wissen  und  reden  mögen. \r\n\r\nIch  bin  immer  fleißig  und  halte  mich  nun  an  die  mensch- \r\nliche Figur.  O  wie  weit  und  lang  ist  die  Kunst,  und  wie \r\nunendlich  wird  die  Welt,  wenn  man  sich  nur  einmal  recht \r\nans  Endliche  halten  mag. \r\n\r\nDienstag  den  2  5  sten  geh  ich  nach  Frascati  und  werde \r\nauch  dort  mühen  und  arbeiten.  Es  fängt  nun  an,  zu  gehen. \r\nWenn  es  nur  einmal  recht  ginge. \r\n\r\nMir  ist  aufgefallen,  daß  in  einer  großen  Stadt,  in  einem \r\nweiten  Kreis  auch  der  Ärmste,  der  Geringste  sich  emp- \r\nfindet und  an  einem  kleinen  Orte  der  Beste,  der  Reichste \r\nsich  nicht  fühlen,  nicht  Atem  schöpfen  kann. \r\n\r\nFrascati^  den  28.  September. \r\nIch  bin  hier  sehr  glücklich:  es  wird  den  ganzen  Tag  bis \r\nin  die  Nacht  gezeichnet,  gemalt,  getuscht,  geklebt,  Hand- \r\nwerk und  Kunst  recht  ex  professo  getrieben.  Rat  Reiffen- \r\nstein,  mein  Wirt,  leistet  Gesellschaft,  und  wir  sind  munter \r\nund  lustig.  Abends  werden  die  Villen  im  Mondschein \r\nbesucht  und  sogar  im  Dunkeln  die  frappantesten  Motive \r\nnachgezeichnet.  Einige  haben  wir  aufgejagt,  die  ich  nur \r\neinmal  auszuführen  wünsche.  Nun  hoff  ich,  daß  auch  die \r\nZeit  des  Vollendens  kommen  wird.  Die  Vollendung  liegt \r\nnur  zu  weit,  wenn  man  weit  sieht. \r\n\r\nGestern  fuhren  wir  nach  Albano  und  wieder  zurück;  auch \r\nauf  diesem  Wege  sind  viele  Vögel  im  Fluge  geschossen \r\n\r\n\r\n42  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nworden.  Hier,  wo  man  recht  in  der  Fülle  sitzt,  kann \r\nman  sich  was  zugute  tun;  auch  brenne  ich  recht  vor \r\nLeidenschaft,  mir  alles  zuzueignen,  und  ich  fühle,  daß \r\nsich  mein  Geschmack  reinigt,  nach  dem  Maße,  wie \r\nmeine  Seele  mehr  Gegenstände  faßt.  Wenn  ich  nur \r\nstatt  all  des  Redens  einmal  etwas  Gutes  schicken  könnte. \r\nEinige  Kleinigkeiten  gehen  mit  einem  Landsmann  an \r\neuch  ab. \r\n\r\nWahrscheinlich  hab  ich  die  Freude,  Kaysern  in  Rom  zu \r\nsehen.  So  wird  sich  denn  auch  noch  die  Musik  zu  mir \r\ngesellen,  um  den  Reihen  zu  schließen,  den  die  Künste \r\num  mich  ziehen,  gleichsam  als  wollten  sie  mich  verhin- \r\ndern, nach  meinen  Freunden  zu  sehen.  Und  doch  darf \r\nich  kaum  das  Kapitel  berühren,  wie  sehr  allein  ich  mich \r\noft  fühle,  und  welche  Sehnsucht  mich  ergreift,  bei  euch \r\nzu  sein.  Ich  lebe  doch  nur  im  Grunde  im  Taumel  weg, \r\nwill  und  kann  nicht  weiter  denken. \r\n\r\nMit  Moritz  hab  ich  recht  gute  Stunden  und  habe  ange- \r\nfangen, ihm  mein  Pflanzensystem  zu  erklären  und  jedes- \r\nmal in  seiner  Gegenwart  aufzusclireiben,  wie  weit  wir \r\ngekommen  sind.  Auf  diese  Art  könnt  ich  allein  etwas \r\nvon  meinen  Gedanken  zu  Pai)ier  bringen.  Wie  faßlich \r\naber  das  Abstrakteste  von  dieser  Vorstellungsart  wird, \r\nwenn  es  mit  der  rechten  Methode  vorgetragen  wird  und \r\neine  vorbereitete  Seele  findet,  seh  ich  an  meinem  neuen \r\nSchüler.  Er  hat  eine  große  Freude  daran  und  ruckt \r\nimmer  selbst  mit  Schlüssen  vorwärts.  Doch  auf  alle  Fälle \r\nists  schwer  zu  schreiben  und  unmöglich  aus  dem  bloßen \r\nLesen  zu  begreifen,  wenn  auch  alles  noch  so  eigentlich \r\nund  scharf  geschrieben  wäre. \r\n\r\nSo  lebe  ich  denn  glücklich,  weil  ich  in  dem  bin,  was \r\nmeines  Vaters  ist.  Grüßt  alle,  die  mirs  gönnen  und  mir \r\ndirekt  oder  indirekt  helfen,  mich  fördern  und  erhalten. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nSeptember \r\n\r\nDer  3.  September  war  mir  heute  doppelt  und  dreifach \r\n\r\nmerkwürdig,  um  ihn  zu  feiern.    Es  war  der  Geburtstag \r\n\r\nmeines  Fürsten,  welcher  eine  treue  Neigung  mit  so  man- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  425 \r\n\r\nnigfaltigem  Guten  zu  erwidern  wußte;  es  war  der  Jahres- \r\ntag meiner  Hegire  von  Karlsbad,  und  noch  durfte  ich \r\nnicht  zurückschauen,  was  ein  so  bedeutend  durchlebter, \r\nvöllig  fremder  Zustand  auf  mich  gewirkt,  mir  gebracht \r\nund  verliehen;  wie  mir  auch  nicht  Raum  zu  vielem  Nach- \r\ndenken übrig  blieb. \r\n\r\nRom  hat  den  eignen  großen  Vorzug,  daß  es  als  Mittel- \r\npunkt künstlerischer  Tätigkeit  anzusehen  ist.  Gebildete \r\nReisende  sprechen  ein;  sie  sind  ihrem  kürzeren  oder \r\nlängeren  Aufenthalte  hier  gar  vieles  schuldig;  sie  ziehen \r\nweiter,  wirken  und  sammeln,  und  wenn  sie  bereichert \r\nnach  Hause  kommen,  so  rechnen  sie  sichs  zur  Ehre  und \r\nFreude,  das  Erworbene  auszulegen  und  ein  Opfer  der \r\nDankbarkeit  ihren  entfernten  und  gegenwärtigen  Lehrern \r\ndarzubringen. \r\n\r\nEin  französischer  Architekt,  mit  Namen  Cassas,  kam  von \r\nseiner  Reise  in  den  Orient  zurück;  er  hatte  die  wichtig- \r\nsten alten  Monumente,  besonders  die  noch  nicht  heraus- \r\ngegebenen, gemessen,  auch  die  Gegenden,  wie  sie  an- \r\nzuschauen sind,  gezeichnet,  nicht  weniger  alte  zerfallene \r\nund  zerstörte  Zustände  bildlich  wieder  hergestellt  und \r\neinen  Teil  seiner  Zeichnungen,  von  großer  Präzision  und \r\nGeschmack,  mit  der  Feder  umrissen  und,  mit  Aquarell- \r\nfarben belebt,  dem  Auge  dargestellt. \r\nI.  Das  Serail  von  Konstantinopel  von  der  Seeseite  mit \r\neinem  Teil  der  Stadt  und  der  Sophienmoschee.  Auf  der \r\nreizendsten  Spitze  von  Europa  ist  der  Wohnort  des  Groß- \r\nherrn  so  lustig  angebaut,  als  man  es  nur  denken  kann. \r\nHohe  und  immer  respektierte  Bäume  stehen  in  großen \r\nmeist  verbundenen  Gruppen  hintereinander;  darunter \r\nsieht  man  nicht  etwa  große  Mauern  und  Paläste,  sondern \r\nHäuschen,  Gitterwerke,  Gänge,  Kiosken,  ausgespannte \r\nTeppiche,  so  häuslich  klein  und  freundlich  durcheinander \r\ngemischt,  daß  es  eine  Lust  ist.  Da  die  Zeichnung  mit \r\nFarben  ausgeführt  ist,  macht  es  einen  gar  freundlichen \r\nEffekt.  Eine  schöne  Strecke  Meer  bespült  die  so  bebaute \r\nKüste.  Gegenüber  liegt  Asien,  und  man  sieht  in  die  Meer- \r\nenge, die  nach  den  Dardanellen  führt.  Die  Zeichnung  ist \r\nbei  sieben  Fuß  lansr  und  drei  bis  vier  hoch. \r\n\r\n\r\n42  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\n2.  Generalaussicht  der  Ruinen  von  Palmyra,  in  derselben \r\nGröße.  Er  zeigte  uns  vorher  einen  Grundriß  der  Stadt, \r\nwie  er  ihn  aus  den  Trümmern  herausgesucht.  Eine  Ko- \r\nlonnade, auf  eine  italienische  Meile  lang,  ging  vom  Tore \r\ndurch  die  Stadt  bis  zum  Sonnentempel;  nicht  in  ganz \r\ngerader  Linie,  sie  macht  in  der  Mitte  ein  sanftes  Knie. \r\nDie  Kolonnade  war  von  vier  Säulenreihen,  die  Säule \r\nzehn  Diameter  hoch.  Man  sieht  nicht,  daß  sie  oben  be- \r\ndeckt gewesen;  er  glaubt,  es  sei  durch  Teppiche  ge- \r\nschehen. Auf  der  großen  Zeichnung  erscheint  ein  Teil \r\nder  Kolonnade  noch  aufrecht  stehend  im  Vordergrunde. \r\nEine  Karawane,  die  eben  quer  durchzieht,  ist  mit  vielem \r\nGlück  angebracht.  Im  Hintergrunde  steht  der  Sonnen- \r\ntempel, und  auf  der  rechten  Seite  zieht  sich  eine  große \r\nFläche  hin,  auf  welcher  einige  Janitscharen  in  Karriere \r\nforteilen.  Das  sonderbarste  Phänomen  ist:  eine  blaue \r\nLinie,  wie  eine  Meereslinie,  schließt  das  Bild.  Er  er- \r\nklärte es  uns,  daß  der  Horizont  der  Wüste,  der  in  der \r\nFerne  blau  werden  muß,  so  völlig  wie  das  Meer  den \r\nGesichtskreis  schließt,  daß  es  ebenso  in  der  Natur  das \r\nAuge  trügt,  wie  es  uns  im  Bilde  anfangs  getrogen,  da \r\nwir  doch  wußten,  daß  Palmyra  vom  Meer  entfernt  ge- \r\nnug sei. \r\n\r\n3.  Gräber  von  Palmyra. \r\n\r\n4.  Restauration  des  Sonnentempels  zu  Baalbek;  auch  eine \r\nLandschaft  mit  den  Ruinen,  wie  sie  stehen. \r\n\r\n5.  Die  große  Moschee  zu  Jerusalem,  auf  den  Grund  des \r\nSalomonischen  Tempels  gebaut. \r\n\r\n6.  Ruinen  eines  kleinen  Tempels  in  Phönizien. \r\n\r\n7.  Gegend  am  Fuße  des  Bergs  Libanon,  anmutig,  wie \r\nman  sie  denken  mag.  Ein  Pinienwäldchen,  ein  Wasser, \r\ndaran  Hängeweiden  und  Gräber  drunter,  der  Berg  in  der \r\nEntfernung. \r\n\r\n8.  Türkische  Gräber.  Jeder  Grabstein  trägt  den  Haupt- \r\nschmuck des  Verstorbenen,  und  da  sich  die  Türken  durch \r\nden  Kopfschmuck  unterscheiden,  so  sieht  man  gleich  die \r\nWürde  des  Begrabenen.  Auf  den  Gräbern  der  Jungfrauen \r\nwerden  Blumen  mit  großer  Sorgfalt  erzogen. \r\n\r\n9.  Ägyptische  Pyramide  mit  dem  großen  Sphinxkopfe. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  427 \r\n\r\nEr  sei,  sagt  Cassas,  in  einen  Kalkfelsen  gehauen,  und \r\nweil  derselbe  Sprünge  gehabt  und  Ungleichheiten,  habe \r\nman  den  Koloß  mit  Stuck  überzogen  und  gemalt,  wie \r\nman  noch  in  den  Falten  des  Kopfschmuckes  bemerke. \r\nEine  Gesichtspartie  ist  etwa  zehn  Schuh  hoch.  Auf  der \r\nUnterlippe  hat  er  bequem  spazieren  können. \r\n10.  Eine  Pyramide,  nach  einigen  Urkunden,  Anlässen \r\nund  Mutmaßungen  restauriert.  Sie  hat  von  vier  Seiten \r\nvorspringende  Hallen  mit  daneben  stehenden  Obelisken; \r\nnach  den  Hallen  gehen  Gänge  hin,  mit  Sphinxen  besetzt, \r\nwie  sich  solche  noch  in  Oberägypten  befinden.  Es  ist \r\ndiese  Zeichnung  die  ungeheuerste  Architektur-Idee,  die \r\nich  zeitlebens  gesehen,  und  ich  glaube  nicht,  daß  man \r\nweiter  kann. \r\n\r\nAbends,  nachdem  wir  alle  diese  schönen  Sachen  mit  be- \r\nhaglicher Muße  betrachtet,  gingen  wir  in  die  Gärten  auf \r\ndem  Palatin,  wodurch  die  Räume  zwischen  den  Ruinen \r\nder  Kaiserpaläste  urbar  und  anmutig  gemacht  worden. \r\nDort  auf  einem  freien  Gesellschaftsplatze,  wo  man  unter \r\nherrlichen  Bäumen  die  Fragmente  verzierter  Kapitaler, \r\nglatter  und  kannelierter  Säulen,  zerstückte  Basreliefe,  und \r\nwas  noch  derart  im  weiten  Kreise  umhergelegt  hatte,  wie \r\nman  sonsten  Tische,  Stühle  und  Bänke  zu  heiterer  Ver- \r\nsammlung im  Freien  anzubringen  pflegt — dort  genossen \r\nwir  der  reizenden  Zeit  nach  Herzenslust,  und  als  wir  die \r\nmannigfaltigste  Aussicht  mit  frisch  gewaschenen  und  ge- \r\nbildeten Augen  bei  Sonnenuntergang  überschauten,  muß- \r\nten wir  gestehen,  daß  dieses  Bild  auf  alle  die  andern,  die \r\nman  uns  heute  gezeigt,  noch  recht  gut  anzusehen  sei.  In \r\ndemselbigen  Geschmack  von  Cassas  gezeichnet  und  ge- \r\nfärbt würde  es  überall  Entzücken  erregen.  Und  so  wird \r\nuns  durch  künstlerische  Arbeiten  nach  und  nach  das  Auge \r\nso  gestimmt,  daß  wir  für  die  Gegenwart  der  Natur  immer \r\nempfänglicher  und  für  die  Schönheiten,  die  sie  darbietet, \r\nimmer  offener  werden. \r\n\r\nNun  aber  mußte  des  nächsten  Tages  uns  zu  scherzhaften \r\nUnterhaltungen  dienen,  daß  gerade  das,  was  wir  bei  dem \r\nKünstler  Großes  und  Grenzenloses  gesehen,  uns  in  eine \r\nniedrige,  unwürdige  Enge  zu  begeben  veranlassen  sollte. \r\n\r\n\r\n4 2  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDie  herrlichen  ägyptischen  Denkmale  erinnerten  uns  an \r\nden  mächtigen  Obelisk,  der,  auf  dem  Marsfelde  durch \r\nAugust  errichtet,  als  Sonnenweiser  diente,  nunmehr  aber \r\nin  Stücken,  umzäunt  von  einem  Bretterverschlag,  in  einem \r\nschmutzigen  Winkel  auf  den  kühnen  Architekten  wartete, \r\nder  ihn  aufzuerstehen  berufen  möchte.  (NB.  Jetzt  ist  er \r\nauf  dem  Platz  Monte  Citorio  wieder  aufgerichtet  und \r\ndient,  wie  zur  Römerzeit,  abermals  als  Sonnenweiser.) \r\nEr  ist  aus  dem  echtesten  ägyptischen  Granit  gehauen, \r\nüberall  mit  zierlichen  naiven  Figuren,  obgleich  in  dem \r\nbekannten  Stil,  übersäet.  Merkwürdig  war  es,  als  wir \r\nneben  der  sonst  in  die  Luft  gerichteten  Spitze  standen, \r\nauf  den  Zuschärfungen  derselben  Sphinx  nach  Sphinxen \r\nauf  das  zierlichste  abgebildet  zu  sehen,  früher  keinem \r\nmenschlichen  Auge,  sondern  nur  den  Strahlen  der  Sonne \r\nerreichbar.  Hier  tritt  der  Fall  ein,  daß  das  Gottesdienst- \r\nliche der  Kunst  nicht  auf  einen  Effekt  berechnet  ist,  den \r\nes  auf  den  menschlichen  Anblick  machen  soll.  Wir  mach- \r\nten Anstalt,  diese  heiligen  Bilder  abgießen  zu  lassen,  um \r\ndas  bequem  nah  vor  Augen  zu  sehen,  was  sonst  gegen \r\ndie  Wolkenregion  hinaufgerichtet  war. \r\nIn  dem  widerwärtigen  Räume,  worin  wir  uns  mit  dem \r\nwürdigsten  Werke  befanden,  konnten  wir  uns  nicht  ent- \r\nbrechen,  Rom  als  ein  Quodlibet  anzusehen,  aber  als  ein \r\neinziges  in  seiner  Art;  denn  auch  in  diesem  Sinne  hat \r\ndiese  ungeheure  Lokalität  die  größten  Vorzüge.  Hier \r\nbrachte  der  Zufall  nichts  hervor,  er  zerstörte  nur;  alles \r\nauf  den  Füßen  Stehende  ist  herrlich,  alles  Zertrümmerte \r\nist  ehrwürdig,  die  Unform  der  Ruinen  deutet  auf  uralte \r\nRegelmäßigkeit,  welche  sich  in  neuen  großen  Formen \r\nder  Kirchen  und  Paläste  wieder  hervortat. \r\nJene  bald  gefertigten  Abgüsse  brachten  in  Erinnerung, \r\ndaß  in  der  großen  Dehnischen  Pastensammlung,  wovon \r\ndie  Abdrücke  im  ganzen  und  teilweise  verkäuflich  waren, \r\nauch  einiges  Ägyptische  zu  sehen  sei;  und  wie  sich  denn \r\neins  aus  dem  andern  ergibt,  so  wählte  ich  aus  gedachter \r\nSammlung  die  vorzüglichsten  und  bestellte  solche  bei  den \r\nInhabern.  Solche  Abdrücke  sind  der  größte  Schatz  und \r\nein  Fundament,  das  der  in  seinen  Mitteln  beschränkte \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  429 \r\n\r\nLiebhaber  zu  künftigem  großen  mannigfaltigen  Vorteil \r\nbei  sich  niederlegen  kann. \r\n\r\nDie  vier  ersten  Bände  meiner  Schriften,  bei  Göschen, \r\nwaren  angekommen  und  das  Prachtexemplar  sogleich  in \r\ndie  Hände  Angelicas  gegeben,  die  daran  ihre  Mutter- \r\nsprache aufs  neue  zu  beloben  Ursach  zu  finden  glaubte. \r\nIch  aber  durfte  den  Betrachtungen  nicht  nachhängen,  die \r\nsich  mir  bei  dem  Rückblick  auf  meine  früheren  Tätig- \r\nkeiten lebhaft  aufdrangen.  Ich  wußte  nicht,  wie  weit  der \r\neingeschlagene  Weg  mich  führen  würde;  ich  konnte  nicht \r\neinsehen,  inwiefern  jenes  frühere  Bestreben  gelingen  und \r\nwiefern  der  Erfolg  dieses  Sehnens  und  Wandeins  die  auf- \r\ngewendete Mühe  belohnen  würde. \r\n\r\nAber  es  blieb  mir  auch  weder  Zeit  noch  Raum,  rück- \r\nwärts zu  schauen  und  zu  denken.  Die  über  organische \r\nNatur,  deren  Bilden  und  Umbilden  mir  gleichsam  ein- \r\ngeimpften Ideen  erlaubten  keinen  Stillstand,  und  indem \r\nmir  Nachdenkendem  eine  Folge  nach  der  andern  sich \r\nentwickelte,  so  bedurfte  ich,  zu  eigner  Ausbildung,  täg- \r\nlich und  stündlich  irgend  einer  Art  von  Mitteilung.  Ich \r\nversuchte  es  mit  Moritz  und  trug  ihm,  soviel  ich  ver- \r\nmochte, die  Metamorphose  der  Pflanzen  vor;  und  er,  ein \r\nseltsames  Gefäß,  das  immer  leer  und  inhaltsbedürftig \r\nnach  Gegenständen  lechzte,  die  er  sich  aneignen  könnte, \r\ngriff  redlich  mit  ein,  dergestalt  wenigstens,  daß  ich  meine \r\nVorträge  fortzusetzen  Mut  behielt. \r\n\r\nHier  kam  uns  ein  merkwürdiges  Buch,  ich  will  nicht  fra- \r\ngen, ob  zustatten,  aber  doch  zu  bedeutender  Anregung: \r\nHerders  Werk,  das  unter  einem  lakonischen  Titel  über \r\nGott  und  göttliche  Dinge  die  verschiedenen  Ansichten  in \r\nGesprächsform  vorzutragen  bemüht  war.  Mich  versetzte \r\ndiese  Mitteilung  in  jene  Zeiten,  wo  ich,  an  der  Seite  des \r\ntrefflichen  Freundes,  über  diese  Angelegenheiten  mich \r\nmündlich  zu  imterhalten  oft  veranlaßt  war.  Wundersam \r\njedoch  kontrastierte  dieser  in  den  höchsten  frommen \r\nBetrachtungen  versierende  Band  mit  der  Verehrung,  zu \r\nder  uns  das  Fest  eines  besondern  Heiligen  aufrief. \r\nAm  21.  September  ward  das  Andenken  des  heiligen \r\nFranziskus  gefeiert  und  sein  Blut  in  langgedehnter  Pro- \r\n\r\n\r\n43 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nZession  von  Mönchen  und  Gläubigen  in  der  Stadt  um- \r\nhergetragen. Aufmerksam  ward  ich  bei  dem  Vorbeiziehen \r\nso  vieler  Mönche,  deren  einfache  Kleidung  das  Auge  nur \r\nauf  die  Betrachtung  des  Kopfes  hinzog.  Es  war  mir  auf- \r\nfallend, daß  eigentlich  Haar  und  Bart  dazu  gehören,  um \r\nsich  von  dem  männlichen  Individuum  einen  Begriff  zu \r\nmachen.  Erst  mit  Aufmerksamkeit,  dann  mit  Erstaunen \r\nmusterte  ich  die  vor  mir  vorüberziehende  Reihe  und  war \r\nwirklich  entzückt,  zu  sehen,  daß  ein  Gesicht,  von  Haar \r\nund  Bart  in  einen  Rahmen  eingefaßt,  sich  ganz  anders \r\nausnahm  als  das  bartlose  Volk  umher.  Und  ich  konnte \r\nnun  wohl  finden,  daß  dergleichen  Gesichter,  in  Gemälden \r\ndargestellt,  einen  ganz  unnennbaren  Reiz  auf  den  Be- \r\nschauer ausüben  mußten. \r\n\r\nHofrat  Reiftenstein,  welcher  sein  Amt,  Fremde  zu  führen \r\nund  zu  unterhalten,  gehörig  ausstudiert  hatte,  konnte \r\nfreilich  im  Laufe  seines  Geschäfts  nur  allzubald  gewahr \r\nwerden,  daß  Personen,  welche  wenig  mehr  nach  Rom \r\nbringen  als  Lust,  zu  sehen  und  sich  zu  zerstreuen,  mit- \r\nunter an  der  grimmigsten  Langweile  zu  leiden  haben, \r\nindem  ihnen  die  gewohnte  Ausfüllung  müßiger  Stunden \r\nin  einem  fremden  Lande  durchaus  zu  fehlen  pflegt.  Auch \r\nwar  dem  praktischen  Menschenkenner  gar  wohl  bekannt, \r\nwie  sehr  ein  bloßes  Beschauen  ermüde  und  wie  nötig  es \r\nsei,  seine  Freunde  durch  irgend  eine  Selbsttätigkeit  zu \r\nunterhalten  und  zu  beruhigen.  Zwei  Gegenstände  hatte \r\ner  sich  deshalb  ausersehn,  worauf  er  ihre  Geschäftigkeit \r\nzu  richten  pflegte:  die  Wachsmalerei  und  die  Pasten- \r\nfabrikation. Jene  Kunst,  eine  Wachsseife  zum  Bindemittel \r\nder  Farben  anzuwenden,  war  erst  vor  kurzem  wieder  in \r\nden  Gang  gekommen,  imd  da  es  in  der  Kunstwelt  haupt- \r\nsächlich darum  zu  tun  ist,  die  Künstler  auf  irgend  eine \r\nWeise  zu  beschäftigen,  so  gibt  eine  neue  Art,  das  Ge- \r\nwohnte zu  tun,  immer  wieder  frische  Aufmerksamkeit \r\nund  lebhaften  Anlaß,  etwas,  was  man  auf  die  alte  Weise \r\nzu  unternehmen  nicht  Lust  hätte,  in  einer  neuen  zu  ver- \r\nsuchen. \r\n\r\nDas  kühne  Unternehmen,  für  die  Kaiserin  Katharina  die \r\nRaftaelschen  Logen  in  einer  Kopie  zu  verwirklichen  und \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  431 \r\n\r\ndie  Wiederholung  sämtlicher  Architektur  mit  der  Fülle \r\nilxrer  Zieraten  in  Petersburg  möglich  zu  machen,  ward \r\ndurch  diese  neue  Technik  begünstigt,  ja  wäre  vielleicht \r\nohne  dieselbe  nicht  auszuführen  gewesen.  Man  ließ  die- \r\nselben Felder,  VVandteile,  Sockel,  Pilaster,  Kapitaler, \r\nGesimse  aus  den  stärksten  Bohlen  und  Klötzen  eines \r\ndauerhaften  Kastanienholzes  verfertigen,  überzog  sie  mit \r\nLeinwand,  welche  grundiert  sodann  der  Enkaustik  zur \r\nsichern  Unterlage  diente.  Dieses  Werk,  womit  sich  be- \r\nsonders Unterberger,  nach  Anleitung  Reiffensteins,  meh- \r\nrere Jahre  beschäftigt  hatte,  mit  großer  Gewissenhaftig- \r\nkeit ausgeführt,  war  schon  abgegangen,  als  ich  ankam, \r\nund  es  konnte  mir  nur,  was  von  jenem  großen  Unter- \r\nnehmen übrig  blieb,  bekannt  und  anschaulich  werden. \r\nNun  aber  war  durch  eine  solche  Ausführung  die  Enkau- \r\nstik zu  hohen  Ehren  gelangt:  Fremde  von  einigem  Talent \r\nsollten  praktisch  damit  bekannt  werden;  zugerichtete \r\nFarbengarnituren  waren  um  leichten  Preis  zu  haben;  man \r\nkochte  die  Seife  selbst,  genug,  man  hatte  immer  etwas \r\nzu  tun  und  zu  kramen,  wo  sich  nur  ein  müßiger  loser \r\nAugenblick  zeigte.  Auch  mittlere  Künstler  wurden  als \r\nLehrende  und  Nachhelfende  beschäftigt,  und  ich  habe \r\nwohl  einigemal  Fremde  gesehen,  welche  ihre  römischen \r\nenkaustischen  Arbeiten  höchst  behaglich  als  selbstver- \r\nfertigt einpackten  und  mit  zurück  ins  Vaterlandnahmen. \r\nDie  andere  Beschäftigimg,  Pasten  zu  fabrizieren,  war \r\nmehr  für  Männer  geeignet.  Ein  großes  altes  Küchen- \r\ngewölbe im  Reiftensteinischen  Quartier  gab  dazu  die \r\nbeste  Gelegenheit.  Hier  hatte  man  mehr  als  nötigen \r\nRaum  zu  einem  solchen  Geschäft.  Die  refraktäre,  in \r\nFeuer  unschmelzbare  Masse  wurde  aufs  zarteste  pulve- \r\nrisiert und  durchgesiebt,  der  daraus  geknetete  Teig  in \r\nPasten  eingedruckt,  sorgfältig  getrocknet  und  sodann,  mit \r\neinem  eisernen  Ring  umgeben,  in  die  Glut  gebracht, \r\nferner  die  geschmolzene  Glasmasse  darauf  gedruckt,  wo- \r\ndurch doch  immer  ein  kleines  Kunstwerk  zum  Vorschein \r\nkam,  das  einen  jeden  freuen  mußte,  der  es  seinen  eignen \r\nFingern  zu  verdanken  hatte. \r\nHofrat  Reiftenstein,  welcher  mich  zwar  willig  und  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\n432  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nschäftig  in  diese  Tätigkeiten  eingeführt  hatte,  merkte  gar \r\nbald,  daß  mir  eine  fortgesetzte  Beschäftigung  der  Art \r\nnicht  zusagte,  daß  mein  eigentlicher  Trieb  war,  durch \r\nNachbildung  von  Natur-  und  Kunstgegenständen  Hand \r\nund  Augen  möglichst  zu  steigern.  Auch  war  die  große \r\nHitze  kaum  vorübergegangen,  als  er  mich  schon,  in  Ge- \r\nsellschaft von  einigen  Künstlern,  nach  Frascati  führte, \r\nwo  man  in  einem  wohleingerichteten  Privathause  Unter- \r\nkommen und  das  nächste  Bedürfnis  fand  und  nun,  den \r\nganzen  Tag  im  Freien,  sich  abends  gern  um  einen  großen \r\nAhomtisch  versammelte.  Georg  Schütz,  ein  Frankfurter, \r\ngeschickt  ohne  eminentes  Talent,  eher  einem  gewissen \r\nanständigen  Behagen  als  anhaltender  künstlerischer  Tätig- \r\nkeit ergeben,  weswegen  ihn  die  Römer  auch  il  Barone \r\nnannten,  begleitete  mich  auf  meinen  Wanderungen  und \r\nward  mir  vielfach  nützlich.  Wenn  man  bedenkt,  daß \r\nJahrhunderte  hier  im  höchsten  Sinne  architektonisch  ge- \r\nwaltet, daß  auf  übrig  gebliebenen  mächtigen  Substruk- \r\ntionen  die  künstlerischen  Gedanken  vorzüglicher  Geister \r\nsich  hervorgehoben  und  den  Augen  dargestellt,  so  wird \r\nman  begreifen,  wie  sich  Geist  und  Aug  entzücken  müssen, \r\nwenn  man  unter  jedei  Beleuchtung  diese  vielfachen \r\nhorizontalen  und  tausend  vertikalen  Linien  unterbrochen \r\nund  geschmückt  wie  eine  stumme  Musik  mit  den  Augen \r\nauffaßt  und  wie  alles,  was  klein  und  beschränkt  in  uns \r\nist,  nicht  ohne  Schmerz  erregt  und  ausgetrieben  wird. \r\nBesonders  ist  die  Fülle  der  Mondscheinbilder  über  alle \r\nBegriffe,  wo  das  einzeln  Unterhaltende,  vielleicht  störend \r\nzu  Nennende  durchaus  zurücktritt  und  nur  die  großen \r\nMassen  von  Licht  und  Schatten  ungeheuer  anmutige, \r\nsymmetrisch  harmonische  Riesenkörper  dem  Auge  ent- \r\ngegentragen. Dagegen  fehlte  es  denn  auch  abends  nicht \r\nan  unterrichtender,  oft  aber  auch  neckischer  Unter- \r\nhaltung. \r\n\r\nSo  darf  man  nicht  verschweigen,  daß  junge  Künstler,  die \r\nEigenheitendes  wackern  Reiftensteins,  die  man  Schwach- \r\nheiten zu  nennen  pflegt,  kennend  und  bemerkend,  dar- \r\nüber sich  oft  im  stillen  scherzhaft  und  spottend  unter- \r\nhielten. Nun  war  eines  Abends  der  Apoll  von  Belvedere, \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  433 \r\n\r\nals  eine  unversiegbare  Quelle  künstlerischer  Unterhaltung, \r\nwieder  zum  Gespräch  gelangt,  und  bei  der  Bemerkung, \r\ndaß  die  Ohren  an  diesem  trefflichen  Kopfe  doch  nicht \r\nsonderlich  gearbeitet  seien,  kam  die  Rede  ganz  natürlich \r\nauf  die  Würde  und  Schönheit  dieses  Organs,  die  Schwie- \r\nrigkeit, ein  schönes  in  der  Natur  zu  finden  und  es  künst- \r\nlerisch ebenmäßig  nachzubilden.  Da  nun  Schütz  wegen \r\nseiner  hübschen  Ohren  bekannt  war,  ersuchte  ich  ihn, \r\nmir  bei  der  Lampe  zu  sitzen,  bis  ich  das  vorzüglich  gut \r\ngebildete — es  war  ohne  Frage  das  rechte — sorgfältig  ab- \r\ngezeichnet hätte.  Nun  kam  er  mit  seiner  starren  Modell- \r\nstellung gerade  dem  Rat  Reiffenstein  gegenüber  zu  sitzen, \r\nvon  welchem  er  die  Augen  nicht  abwenden  konnte  noch \r\ndurfte.  Jener  fing  nun  an,  seine  wiederholt  angepriesenen \r\nLehren  vorzutragen:  man  müßte  sich  nämlich  nicht  gleich \r\nunmittelbar  an  das  Beste  wenden,  sondern  erst  bei  den \r\nCarraccis  anfangen,  und  zwar  in  der  Farnesischen  Gale- \r\nrie, dann  zum  Raffael  übergehen  und  zuletzt  den  Apoll \r\nvon  Belvedere  so  oft  zeichnen,  bis  man  ihn  auswendig \r\nkönne,  da  denn  nicht  viel  Weiteres  zu  wünschen  und  zu \r\nhoffen  sein  würde. \r\n\r\nDer  gute  Schütz  ward  von  einem  solchen  innerlichen \r\nAnfall  von  Lachen  ergriffen,  den  er  äußerlich  kaum  zu \r\nbergen  wußte,  welche  Pein  sich  immer  vermehrte,  je \r\nlänger  ich  ihn  in  ruhiger  Stellung  zu  halten  trachtete.  So \r\nkann  sich  der  Lehrer,  der  Wohltäter  immer  wegen  seines \r\nindividuellen,  unbillig  aufgenommenen  Zustandes  einer \r\nspöttischen  Undankbarkeit  erwarten. \r\nEine  herrliche,  obgleich  nicht  unerwartete  Aussicht  ward \r\nuns  aus  den  Fenstern  der  Villa  des  Fürsten  Aldobrandini, \r\nder,  gerade  auf  dem  Lande  gegenwärtig,  uns  freundlich \r\neinlud  und  uns  in  Gesellschaft  seiner  geistlichen  und  welt- \r\nlichen Hausgenossen  an  einer  gutbesetzten  Tafel  festlich \r\nbewirtete.  Es  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  man  das  Schloß \r\ndergestalt  angelegt  hat,  die  Herrlichkeit  der  Hügel  und \r\ndes  flachen  Landes  mit  einem  Blick  übersehen  zu  können. \r\nMan  spricht  viel  von  Lusthäusern;  aber  man  müßte  von \r\nhier  aus  umherblicken,  um  sich  zu  überzeugen,  daß  nicht \r\nleicht  ein  Haus  lustiger  gelegen  sein  könne. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  28 \r\n\r\n\r\n434  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nHier  aber  finde  ich  mich  gedrängt,  eine  Betrachtung  ein- \r\nzufügen, deren  ernste  Bedeutung  ich  wohl  empfehlen \r\ndarf.  Sie  gibt  Licht  über  das  Vorgetragene  und  ver- \r\nbreitets  über  das  Folgende;  auch  wird  mancher  gute, \r\nsich  heranbildende  Geist  Anlaß  daher  zur  Selbstprüfung \r\ngewinnen. \r\n\r\nLebhaft  vordringende  Geister  begnügen  sich  nicht  mit \r\ndem  Genüsse,  sie  verlangen  Kenntnis.  Diese  treibt  sie \r\nzur  Selbsttätigkeit,  und  wie  es  ihr  nun  auch  gelingen \r\nmöge,  so  fühlt  man  zuletzt,  daß  man  nichts  richtig  be- \r\ntu-teilt,  als  was  man  selbst  hervorbringen  kann.  Doch \r\nhierüber  kommt  der  Mensch  nicht  leicht  ins  klare,  und \r\ndaraus  entstehen  gewisse  falsche  Bestrebungen,  welche \r\num  desto  ängstlicher  werden,  je  redlicher  und  reiner  die \r\nAbsicht  ist.  Indes  fingen  mir  in  dieser  Zeit  an  Zweifel \r\nund  Vermutungen  aufzusteigen,  die  mich  mitten  in  die- \r\nsen angenehmen  Zuständen  beunruhigten;  denn  ich  mußte \r\nbald  empfinden,  daß  der  eigentliche  Wunsch  und  die \r\nAbsicht  meines  Hierseins  schwerlich  erfüllt  werden \r\ndürfte. \r\n\r\nNunmehr  aber,  nach  Verlauf  einiger  vergnügter  Tage, \r\nkehrten  wir  nach  Rom  zurück,  wo  wir  durch  eine  neue \r\nhöchst  anmutige  Oper  im  hellen  vollgedrängten  Saal  für \r\ndie  vermißte  Himmelsfreiheit  entschädigt  werden  sollten. \r\nDie  deutsche  Künstlerbank,  eine  der  vordersten  im  Par- \r\nterre, war  wie  sonst  dicht  besetzt,  und  auch  diesmal \r\nfehlte  es  nicht  an  Beifallklatschen  und  Rufen,  um  sowohl \r\nwegen  der  gegenwärtigen  als  vergangenen  Genüsse  unsre \r\nSchuldigkeit  abzutragen.  Ja  wir  hatten  es  erreicht,  daß \r\nwir  durch  ein  künstliches,  erst  leiseres,  dann  stärkeres, \r\nzuletzt  gebietendes  Zitti-Rufen  jederzeit  mit  dem  Ritor- \r\nnell  einer  eintretenden  beliebten  Arie  oder  sonst  gefälli- \r\ngen Partie  das  ganze  laut  schwätzende  Publikum  zum \r\nSchweigen  brachten,  weshalb  uns  denn  unsere  Freunde \r\nvon  oben  die  Artigkeit  erwiesen,  die  interessantesten  Ex- \r\nhibitionen  nach  unsrer  Seite  zu  richten. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  435 \r\n\r\nOktober \r\n\r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nFrascati,  den  2.  Oktober. \r\nIch  muß  beizeiten  ein  Blättchen  anfangen,  wenn  ihr  es \r\nzur  rechten  Zeit  erhalten  sollt.  Eigentlich  hab  ich  viel \r\nund  nicht  viel  zu  sagen.  Es  wird  immerfort  gezeichnet, \r\nund  ich  denke  dabei  im  stillen  an  meine  Freunde.  Diese \r\nTage  empfand  ich  wieder  viel  Sehnsucht  nach  Hause, \r\nvielleicht  eben  weil  es  mir  hier  so  wohl  geht  und  ich \r\ndoch  fühle,  daß  mir  mein  Liebstes  fehlt. \r\nIch  bin  in  einer  recht  wunderlichen  Lage  und  will  mich \r\neben  zusammennehm^en,  jeden  Tag  nutzen,  tun,  was  zu \r\ntun  ist,  und  so  diesen  Winter  durch  arbeiten. \r\nIhr  glaubt  nicht,  wie  nützlich,  aber  auch  wie  schwer  es \r\nmir  war,  dieses  ganze  Jahr  absolut  unter  fremden  Men- \r\nschen zu  leben,  besonders  da  Tischbein — dies  sei  unter \r\nuns  gesagt— nicht  so  einschlug,  wie  ich  hoffte.  Es  ist \r\nein  wirklich  guter  Mensch,  aber  er  ist  nicht  so  rein,  so \r\nnatürlich,  so  offen  wie  seine  Briefe.  Seinen  Charakter \r\nkann  ich  nur  mündlich  schildern,  um  ihm  nicht  unrecht \r\nzu  tun;  und  was  will  eine  Schilderung  heißen,  die  man \r\nso  macht.  Das  Leben  eines  Menschen  ist  sein  Charakter. \r\nNun  hab  ich  Hoffnung,  Kaysem  zu  besitzen;  dieser  wird \r\nmir  zu  großer  Freude  sein.  Gebe  der  Himmel,  daß  sich \r\nnichts  dazwischen  stelle! \r\n\r\nMeine  erste  Angelegenheit  ist  und  bleibt,  daß  ich  es  im \r\nZeichnen  zu  einem  gewissen  Grade  bringe,  wo  man  mit \r\nLeichtigkeit  etwas  macht  und  nicht  wieder  zurücklernt \r\nnoch  so  lange  still  steht,  wie  ich  wohl  leider  die  schönste \r\nZeit  des  Lebens  versäumt  habe.  Doch  muß  man  sich \r\nselbst  entschuldigen.  Zeichnen,  um  zu  zeichnen,  wäre \r\nwie  reden,  um  zu  reden.  Wenn  ich  nichts  auszudrücken \r\nhabe,  wenn  mich  nichts  anreizt,  wenn  ich  würdige  Gegen- \r\nstände erst  mühsam  aufsuchen  muß,  ja  mit  allem  Suchen \r\nsie  kaum  finde,  wo  soll  da  der  Nachahmungstrieb  her- \r\nkommen? In  diesen  Gegenden  muß  man  zum  Künstler \r\nwerden:  so  dringt  sich  alles  auf,  man  wird  voller  und \r\nvoller  und  gezwungen,  etwas  zu  machen.     Nach  meiner \r\n\r\n\r\n436  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nAnlage  und  meiner  Kenntnis  des  Weges  bin  ich  über- \r\nzeugt, daß  ich  hier  in  einigen  Jahren  sehr  weit  kommen \r\nmüßte. \r\n\r\nIhr  verlangt,  meine  Lieben,  daß  ich  von  mir  selbst \r\nschreibe,  und  seht,  wie  ichs  tue;  wenn  wir  wieder  zu- \r\nsammenkommen, sollt  ihr  gar  manches  hören.  Ich  habe \r\nGelegenheit  gehabt,  über  mich  selbst  und  andre,  über \r\nWelt  und  Geschichte  viel  nachzudenken,  wovon  ich  man- \r\nches Gute,  wenn  gleich  nicht  Neue,  auf  meine  Art  mit- \r\nteilen werde.  Zuletzt  wird  alles  im  Wilhelm  gefaßt  und \r\ngeschlossen. \r\n\r\nMoritz  ist  bisher  mein  liebster  Gesellschafter  geblieben, \r\nob  ich  gleich  bei  ihm  fürchtete  und  fast  noch  fürchte,  er \r\nmöchte  aus  meinem  Umgange  nur  klüger  und  weder  rich- \r\ntiger, besser,  noch  glücklicher  werden — eine  Sorge,  die \r\nmich  immer  zurückhält,  ganz  often  zu  sein. \r\nAuch  im  allgemeinen  mit  mehreren  Menschen  zu  leben, \r\ngeht  mir  ganz  gut.  Ich  sehe  eines  jeden  Gemütsart  und \r\nHandelsweise.  Der  eine  spielt  sein  Spiel,  der  andre \r\nnicht;  dieser  wird  vorwärts  kommen,  jener  schwerlich. \r\nEiner  sammelt,  einer  zerstreut.  Einem  genügt  alles,  dem \r\nandern  nichts.  Der  hat  Talent  und  übts  nicht,  jener  hat \r\nkeins  und  ist  fleißig  usw.  usw.  Das  alles  sehe  ich  und \r\nmich  mitten  drin;  es  vergnügt  mich  und  gibt  mir,  da  ich \r\nkeinen  Teil  an  den  Menschen,  nichts  an  ihnen  zu  ver- \r\nantworten habe,  keinen  bösen  Humor.  Nur  alsdann, \r\nmeine  Lieben,  wenn  jeder  nach  seiner  Weise  handelt \r\nund  zuletzt  noch  prätendiert,  daß  ein  Ganzes  werden, \r\nsein  und  bleiben  solle,  es  zunächst  von  mir  prätendiert, \r\ndann  bleibt  einem  nichts  übrig,  als  zu  scheiden  oder  toll \r\nzu  werden. \r\n\r\nAlbano,  den  5.  Oktober. \r\nIch  will  sehen,  daß  ich  diesen  Brief  noch  zur  morgen- \r\nden Post  nach  Rom  schaffe,  daß  ich  auf  diesem  Blatt \r\nnur  den  tausendsten  Teil  sage  von  dem,  was  ich  zu  sagen \r\nhabe. \r\n\r\nEure  Blätter  hab  ich  zu  gleicher  Zeit  mit  den  zerstreuten, \r\nbesser  gesammelten  Blättern,  den  Ideen  und  den  vier  Saf- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  437 \r\n\r\nfianbänden  erhalten,  gestern  als  ich  im  Begriff  war,  von \r\nFrascati  abzufahren.     Es  ist  mir  nun  ein  Schatz  auf  die \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Persepolis\"  habe  ich  gestern  nacht  gelesen.  Es  freut  mich \r\nunendlich,  und  ich  kann  nichts  dazu  setzen,  indem  jene \r\nArt  und  Kunst  nicht  herübergekommen  ist.  Ich  will  nun \r\ndie  angeführten  Bücher  auf  irgend  einer  Bibliothek  sehen \r\nund  euch  aufs  neue  danken.  Fahret  fort,  ich  bitte  euch, \r\noder  fahret  fort,  weil  ihr  müßt,  beleuchtet  alles  mit  eurem \r\nLichte. \r\n\r\nDie  Ideen^  die  Gedichte  sind  noch  nicht  berührt.  Meine \r\nSchriften  mögen  nun  gehen,  ich  will  treulich  fortfahren. \r\nDie  vier  Kupfer  zu  den  letzten  Bänden  sollen  hier \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nMit  den  Genannten  war  unser  Verhältnis  nur  ein  gut- \r\nmütiger Waffenstillstand  von  beiden  Seiten:  ich  habe  das \r\nwohl  gewußt;  nur  was  werden  kann,  kann  werden.  Es \r\nwird  immer  weitere  Entfernung  und  endlich,  wenns  recht \r\ngut  geht,  leise,  lose  Trennung  werden.  Der  eine  ist  ein \r\nNarr,  der  voller  Einfaltsprätensionen  steckt.  'Meine \r\nMutter  hat  Gänse!'  singt  sich  mit  bequemerer  Naivetät \r\nals  ein:  'Allein  Gott  in  der  Höh  sei  Ehr!'  Er  ist  einmal \r\nauch  ein — :  'Sie  lassen  sich  das  Heu  und  Stroh,  das  Heu \r\nund  Stroh  nicht  irren  usw.  usw.'  Bleibt  von  diesem  Volke! \r\nder  erste  Undank  ist  besser  als  der  letzte.  Der  andere \r\ndenkt,  er  komme  aus  einem  fremden  Lande  zu  den  Sei- \r\nnigen ^  und  er  kommt  zu  Menschen,  die  sich  selbst  suchen^ \r\nohne  es  gestehn  zu  wollen.  Er  wird  sich  fremd  finden \r\nund  vielleicht  nicht  wissen,  warum.  Ich  müßte  mich  sehr \r\nirren,  oder  die  Großmut  des  Alcihiades  ist  ein  Taschen- \r\nspielerstreich des  Züricher  Propheten,  der  klug  genug \r\nund  gewandt  genug  ist,  große  und  kleine  Kugeln  mit \r\nunglaublicher  Behendigkeit  einander  zu  substituieren, \r\ndurcheinander  zu  mischen,  um  das  Wahre  und  Falsche \r\nnach  seinem  theologischen  Dichtergemüt  gelten  und  ver- \r\nschwinden zu  machen.  Hole  oder  erhalte  ihn  der  Teufel, \r\nder  ein  Freund  der  Lügen,  Dämonologie,  Ahnungen, \r\nSehnsuchten  usw.  ist  von  Anfang! \r\nUnd  ich  muß  ein  neues  Blatt  nehmen  und  bitten,  daß  ihr \r\n\r\n\r\n438  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nlest,  wie  ich  schreibe:  mit  dem  Geiste  mehr  als  den  Augen, \r\nv/ie  ich  mit  der  Seele  mehr  als  den  Händen. \r\nFahre  du  fort,  lieber  Bruder,  zu  sinnen,  zu  finden,  zu \r\nvereinigen,  zu  dichten,  zu  schreiben,  ohne  dich  um  andre \r\nzu  bekümmern.  Man  muß  schreiben,  wie  man  lebt,  erst \r\num  sein  selbst  willen,  und  dann  existiert  man  auch  für \r\nverwandte  Wesen. \r\n\r\nPlato  wollte  keinen  dYe(ü[J-£Tpr|TOV  in  seiner  Schule  leiden; \r\nwäre  ich  imstande,  eine  zu  machen,  ich  litte  keinen,  der \r\nsich  nicht  irgend  ein  Naturstudium  ernst  und  eigentlich \r\ngewählt.  Neulich  fand  ich  in  einer  leidig  apostolisch- \r\nkapuzinermäßigen  Deklamation  des  Zürcher  Propheten \r\ndie  unsinnigen  Worte:  'Alles,  was  Leben  hat,  lebt  durch \r\netwas  außer  sich.'  Oder  so  ohngefähr  klangs.  Das  kann \r\nnun  so  ein  Heidenbekehrer  hinschreiben,  und  bei  der \r\nRevision  zupft  ihn  der  Genius  nicht  beim  Ärmel.  Nicht \r\ndie  ersten,  simpelsten  Naturwahrheiten  haben  sie  gefaßt, \r\nund  möchten  doch  gar  zu  gern  auf  den  Stühlen  um  den \r\nThron  sitzen,  wo  andre  Leute  hingehören  oder  keiner \r\nhingehört.  Laß  das  alles  gut  sein,  wie  ich  auch  tue,  der \r\nich  es  freilich  jetzt  leichter  habe! \r\n\r\nIch  mag  von  meinem  Leben  keine  Beschreibung  machen, \r\nes  sieht  gar  zu  lustig  aus.  Vor  allem  beschäftigt  mich  das \r\nLandschaftszeichnen,  wozu  dieser  Himmel  und  diese  Erde \r\nvorzüglich  einlädt.  Sogar  hab  ich  einige  Idyllen  gefunden. \r\nWas  werd  ich  nicht  noch  alles  machen.  Das  seh  ich  wohl: \r\nunsereiner  muß  nur  immer  neue  Gegenstände  um  sich \r\nhaben,  dann  ist  er  geborgen. \r\n\r\nLebt  wohl  und  vergnügt,  und  wenn  es  euch  weh  werden \r\nwill,  so  fühlt  nur  recht,  daß  ihr  beisammen  seid  und  was \r\nihr  einander  seid,  indes  ich,  durch  eignen  Willen  exiliert, \r\nmit  Vorsatz  irrend,  zweckmäßig  unklug,  überall  fremd \r\nund  überall  zu  Hause,  mein  Leben  mehr  laufen  lasse  als \r\nflihre  und  auf  alle  Fälle  nicht  weiß,  wo  es  hinaus  will. \r\nLebt  wohl,  empfehlt  mich  der  Frau  Herzogin.  Ich  habe \r\nmit  Rat  Reiffenstein  in  Frascati  ihren  ganzen  Aufenthalt \r\nprojektiert.  Wenn  alles  gelingt,  so  ists  ein  Meisterstück. \r\nWir  sind  jetzt  in  Negotiation  wegen  einer  Villa  begriften, \r\nwelche  gewissermaßen  secjuestriert  ist  und  also  vermietet \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  439 \r\n\r\nwird,  anstatt  daß  die  andern  entweder  besetzt  sind  oder \r\nvon  den  großen  Familien  nur  aus  Gefälligkeit  abgetreten \r\nwürden,  dagegen  man  in  Obligationen  und  Relationen \r\ngerät.  Ich  schreibe,  sobald  nur  etwas  Gewisseres  zu  sagen \r\nist.  In  Rom  ist  auch  ein  schönes  freiliegendes  Quartier \r\nmit  einem  Garten  für  sie  bereit.  Und  so  wünscht  ich, \r\ndaß  sie  sich  überall  zu  Hause  fände,  denn  sonst  genießt \r\nsie  nichts:  die  Zeit  verstreicht,  das  Geld  ist  ausgegeben, \r\nund  man  sieht  sich  um  wie  nach  einem  Vogel,  der  einem \r\naus  der  Hand  entwischt  ist.  Wenn  ich  ihr  alles  einrichten \r\nkann,  daß  ihr  Fuß  an  keinen  Stein  stoße,  so  will  ich  es \r\ntun. \r\n\r\nNun  kann  ich  nicht  weiter,  wenngleich  noch  Raum  da  ist. \r\nLebt  wohl  und  verzeiht  die  Eilfertigkeit  dieser  Zeilen. \r\n\r\nCastcl  Gaiidolfo, \r\nden  8.  Oktober,  eigentlich  den  i2ten, \r\ndenn  diese  Woche  ist  hingegangen,  ohne  daß  ich  zum \r\nSchreiben  kommen  konnte.  Also  geht  dieses  Blättchen \r\nnur  eilig  nach  Rom,  daß  es  noch  zu  euch  gelange. \r\nWir  leben  hier,  wie  man  in  Bädern  lebt;  nur  mache  ich \r\nmich  des  Morgens  beiseite,  um  zu  zeichnen.  Dann  muß \r\nman  den  ganzen  Tag  der  Gesellschaft  sein,  welches  mir \r\ndenn  auch  ganz  recht  ist  für  diese  kurze  Zeit:  ich  sehe \r\ndoch  auch  einmal  Menschen  ohne  großen  Zeitverlust  und \r\nviele  auf  einmal. \r\n\r\nAngelica  ist  auch  hier  und  wohnt  in  der  Nähe;  dann  sind \r\neinige  muntere  Mädchen,  einige  Frauen,  Herr  vonMaron, \r\nSchwager  von  Mengs,  mit  der  seinigen,  teils  im  Hause, \r\nteils  in  der  Nachbarschaft;  die  Gesellschaft  ist  lustig,  und \r\nes  gibt  immer  was  zu  lachen.  Abends  geht  man  in  die \r\nKomödie,  wo  Pulcinell  die  Hauptperson  ist,  und  trägt \r\nsich  dann  einen  Tag  mit  den  Bonmots  des  vergangnen \r\nAbends.  Tout  comme  chez  nous — nur  unter  einem  heitern \r\nköstlichen  Himmel.  Heute  hat  sich  ein  Wind  erhoben, \r\nder  mich  zu  Hause  hält.  W  enn  man  mich  außer  mir  selbst \r\nherausbringen  könnte,  müßten  es  diese  Tage  tun;  aber \r\nich  falle  immer  wieder  in  mich  zurück,  und  meine  ganze \r\nNeigung  ist  auf  die  Kunst  gerichtet.    Jeden  Tag  geht  mir \r\n\r\n\r\n440  ITAT.IENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nein  neues  Licht  auf,  und  es  scheint,  als  wenn  ich  wenig- \r\nstens würde  sehen  lernen. \r\n\r\nErwin  und  Elmire  ist  so  gut  als  fertig,  es  kommt  auf  ein \r\npaar  schreibselige  Morgen  an:  gedacht  ist  alles. \r\nHerder  hat  mich  aufgefordert.  Forstern  auf  seine  Reise \r\num  die  Welt  auch  Fragen  und  Mutmaßungen  mitzugeben. \r\nIch  weiß  nicht,  wo  ich  Zeit  und  Sammlung  hernehmen  soll, \r\nwenn  ich  es  auch  von  Herzen  gerne  täte.  Wir  wollen  sehen. \r\nIhr  habt  wohl  schon  kalte  trübe  Tage;  wir  hoffen  noch \r\neinen  ganzen  Monat  zum  Spazierengehn.  Wie  sehr  mich \r\nHerders  \"Ideen\"  freuen,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen.  Da  ich  kei- \r\nnen Messias  zu  erwarten  habe,  so  ist  mir  dies  das  liebste \r\nEvangelium.  Grüßt  alles,  ich  bin  in  Gedanken  immer \r\nmit  euch,  und  liebt  mich. \r\n\r\nAn  Herder \r\n\r\nDen  12.  Oktober. \r\n\r\nNur  ein  flüchtig  Wort  und  zuerst  den  lebhaftesten  Dank  für \r\ndie  \"Ideen\"!  Sie  sind  mir  als  das  liebenswerteste  Evan- \r\ngelium gekommen, und  die  interessantesten  Studien  meines \r\nLebens  laufen  alle  da  zusammen.  Woran  man  sich  so \r\nlange  geplackt  hat,  wird  einem  nun  so  vollständig  vor- \r\ngeführt. Wie  viel  Lust  zu  allem  Guten  hast  du  mir  durch \r\ndieses  Buch  gegeben  und  erneut!  Noch  bin  ich  erst  in \r\nder  Hälfte.  Ich  bitte  dich,  laß  mir  so  bald  als  möglich \r\ndie  Stelle  aus  Camper,  die  du  pag.  159  anfülirst,  ganz \r\nausschreiben,  damit  ich  sehe,  welche  Regeln  des  griechi- \r\nschen Künstlerideals  er  ausgefunden  hat.  Ich  erinnere \r\nmich  nur  an  den  Gang  seiner  Demonstration  des  Profils \r\naus  dem  Kupfer.  Schreibe  mir  dazu  und  exzerpiere  mir \r\nsonst,  was  du  mir  nützlich  dünkst,  daß  ich  das  Ultimum \r\nwisse,  wie  weit  man  in  dieser  Spekulation  gekommen  ist; \r\ndenn  ich  bin  immer  das  neugeborne  Kind.  Hat  Lavaters \r\nPhysiognomik  etwas  Kluges  darüber? — Deinem  Aufruf \r\nwegen  Forsters  will  ich  gerne  gehorchen,  wenn  ich  gleich \r\nnoch  nicht  recht  sehe,  wie  es  möglich  ist;  denn  ich  kann \r\nkeine  einzelnen  Fragen  tun,  ich  muß  meine  Hypothesen \r\nvöllig  auseinandersetzen  und  vortragen.  Du  weißt,  wie \r\nsauer  mir  das  schriftlich  wird.     Schreibe  mir  nur  den \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  441 \r\n\r\nletzten  Termin,  wann  es  fertig  sein  und  wohin  es  geschickt \r\nwerden  soll.  Ich  sitze  jetzt  im  Rohre  und  kann  vor  Pfeifen- \r\nschneiden nicht  zum  Pfeifen  kommen.  Wenn  ich  es  unter- \r\nnehme, muß  ich  zum  Diktieren  mich  wenden;  denn  eigent- \r\nlich seh  ich  es  als  einen  Wink  an.  Es  scheint,  ich  soll \r\nvon  allen  Seiten  mein  Haus  bestellen  und  meine  Bücher \r\nschließen. \r\n\r\nWas  mir  am  schwersten  sein  wird,  ist,  daß  ich  absolut \r\nalles  aus  dem  Kopfe  nehmen  muß:  ich  habe  doch  kein \r\nBlättchen  meiner  Kollektaneen,  keine  Zeichnung,  nichts \r\nhab  ich  bei  mir,  und  alle  neusten  Bücher  fehlen  hier  ganz \r\nund  gar. \r\n\r\nNoch  vierzehn  Tage  bleib  ich  wohl  in  Castello  und  treibe \r\nein  Badeleben.  Morgens  zeichne  ich,  dann  gibts  Men- \r\nschen auf  Menschen.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  sie  bei- \r\nsammen sehe;  einzeln  wäre  es  eine  große  Sekkatur.  An- \r\ngelica  ist  hier  und  hilft  alles  übertragen. \r\nDer  Papst  soll  Nachricht  haben,  Amsterdam  sei  von  den \r\nPreußen  eingenommen.  Die  nächsten  Zeitungen  werden \r\nuns  Gewißheit  bringen.  Das  wäre  die  erste  Expedition, \r\nwo  sich  unser  Jahrhundert  in  seiner  ganzen  Größe  zeigt. \r\nDas  heiß  ich  eine  sodezza!  Ohne  Schwertstreich,  mit  ein \r\npaar  Bomben,  und  niemand,  der  sich  der  Sache  weiter \r\nannimmt!  Lebt  wohl.  Ich  bin  ein  Kind  des  Friedens \r\nund  will  Friede  halten  für  und  für  mit  der  ganzen  Welt, \r\nda  ich  ihn  einmal  mit  mir  selbst  geschlossen  habe. \r\n\r\nRom^  den  23.  Oktober. \r\nDen  letzten  Posttag,  meine  Lieben,  habt  ihr  keinen  Brief \r\nerhalten;  die  Bewegung  in  Castello  war  zuletzt  gar  zu  arg, \r\nmid  ich  wollte  doch  auch  zeichnen.  Es  war  wie  bei  uns \r\nim  Bade,  und  da  ich  in  einem  Hause  wohnte,  das  immer \r\nZuspruch  hat,  so  mußte  ich  mich  drein  geben.  Bei  dieser \r\nGelegenheit  habe  ich  mehr  Italiener  gesehen  als  bisher \r\nin  einem  Jahre  und  bin  auch  mit  dieser  Erfahrung  zu- \r\nfrieden. \r\n\r\nEine  Mailänderin  interessierte  mich  die  acht  Tage  ihres \r\nBleibens;  sie  zeichnete  sich  durch  ihre  Natürlichkeit,  ihren \r\nGemeinsinn,  ihre  gute  Art  sehr  vorteilhaft  vor  den  Röme- \r\n\r\n\r\n442  ITATJENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nrinnen  aus.    Angelica  war,  wie  sie  immer  ist,  verständig, \r\n\r\ngut,  gefällig,  zuvorkommend.    Man  muß  ihr  Freund  sein: \r\n\r\nman  kann  viel  von  ihr  lernen,  besonders  arbeiten;  denn \r\n\r\nes  ist  unglaublich,  was  sie  alles  endigt. \r\n\r\nDiese    letzten  Tage  war  das  Wetter  kühl,    und  ich  bin \r\n\r\nrecht  vergnügt,  wieder  in  Rom  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nGestern  abend,  als  ich  zu  Bette  ging,  fühlt  ich  recht  das \r\n\r\nVergnügen,  hier  zu  sein.    Es  war  mir,  als  wenn  ich  mich \r\n\r\nauf  einen  recht  breiten,  sichern  Grund  niederlegte. \r\n\r\nÜber  seinen  Gott  möcht  ich  gern  mit  Herdern  sprechen. \r\nZu  bemerken  ist  mir  ein  Hauptpunkt:  man  nimmt  dieses \r\nBüchlein,  wie  andre,  für  Speise^  da  es  eigentlich  die \r\nSchüssel  ist.  Wer  nichts  hinein  zu  legen  hat,  findet  sie \r\nleer.  Laßt  mich  ein  wenig  weiter  allegorisieren,  und \r\nHerder  wird  meine  Allegorie  am  besten  erklären.  Mit \r\nHebel  und  Walzen  kann  man  schon  ziemliche  Lasten \r\nfortbringen;  die  Stücke  des  Obelisks  zu  bewegen,  brau- \r\nchen sie  Erdwinden,  Flaschenzüge  usw.  Je  größer  die \r\nLast,  oder  je  feiner  der  Zweck,  wie  zum  Exempel  bei \r\neiner  Uhr,  desto  zusammengesetzter,  desto  künstlicher \r\nwird  der  Mechanismus  sein  und  doch  im  Innern  die  größte \r\nEinheit  haben.  So  sind  alle  Hypothesen  oder  vielmehr \r\nalle  Prinzipien.  Wer  nicht  viel  zu  bewegen  hat,  greift \r\nzum  Hebel  und  verschmäht  meinen  Flaschenzug;  was  will \r\nder  Steinhauer  mit  einer  Schraube  ohne  Ender  Wenn \r\nLavater  seine  ganze  Kraft  anwendet,  um  ein  Märchen \r\nwahr  zu  machen,  wenn  Jacobi  sich  abarbeitet,  eine  hohle \r\nKindergehirnempfindung  zu  vergöttern,  wenn  Claudius \r\naus  einem  Fußboten  ein  Evangelist  werden  möchte,  so \r\nist  offenbar,  daß  sie  alles,  was  die  Tiefen  der  Natur  näher \r\naufschließt,  verabscheuen  müssen.  Würde  der  eine  un- \r\ngestraft sagen:  \"Alles,  was  lebt,  lebt  durch  etwas  außer \r\nsich\"?  würde  der  andere  sich  der  Verwirrung  der  Begriffe, \r\nder  Verwechslung  der  Worte  von  IVissen  und  Glauben, \r\nvon  Überlieferung  und  Erfa/iruiig  nicht  schämen?  würde \r\nder  dritte  nicht  um  ein  paar  Bänke  tiefer  hinunter  müssen, \r\nwenn  sie  nicht  mit  aller  Gewalt  die  Stühle  um  den  Thron \r\ndes  Lamms  aufzustellen  bemüht  wären,  wenn  sie  nicht \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  443 \r\n\r\nsich  sorgfältig  hüteten,  den  festen  Boden  der  Natur  zu \r\nbetreten,  wo  jeder  nur  ist,  was  er  ist,  wo  wir  alle  gleiche \r\nAnsprüche  haben? \r\n\r\nHalte  man  dagegen  ein  Buch  wie  den  dritten  Teil  der \r\nIdeefi,  sehe  erst,  was  es  ist,  und  frage  sodann,  ob  der \r\nAutor  es  hätte  schreiben  können,  ohne  jenen  Begriff  von \r\nGott  zu  haben?  Nimmermehr;  denn  eben  das  Echte, \r\nGroße,  Innerliche,  was  es  hat,  hat  es  in,  aus  und  dii?-ch \r\njenen  Begriff  von  Gott  und  der  Welt. \r\nWenn  es  also  irgendwo  fehlt,  so  mangelts  nicht  an  der \r\nWare,  sondern  an  Käufern,  nicht  an  der  Maschine,  son- \r\ndern an  denen,  die  sie  zu  brauchen  wissen.  Ich  habe \r\nimmer  mit  stillem  Lächeln  zugesehen,  wenn  sie  mich  in \r\nmetaphysischen  Gesprächen  nicht  für  voll  ansahen;  da \r\nich  aber  ein  Künstler  bin,  so  kann  mirs  gleich  sein.  Mir \r\nkönnte  vielmehr  dran  gelegen  sein,  daß  das  Prinzipium \r\nverborgen  bliebe,  aus  dem  und  durch  das  ich  arbeite. \r\nIch  lasse  einem  jeden  seinen  Hebel  und  bediene  mich \r\nder  Schraube  ohne  Ende  schon  lange,  und  nun  mit  noch \r\nmehr  Freude  und  Bequemlichkeit. \r\n\r\nDen  2y.  Oktober. \r\nIch  bin  in  diesem  Zauberkreise  wieder  angelangt  und \r\nbefinde  mich  gleich  wieder  wie  bezaubert,  zufrieden,  stille \r\nhinarbeitend,  vergessend  alles,  was  außer  mir  ist,  und  die \r\nGestalten  meiner  Freunde  besuchen  mich  friedlich  und \r\nfreundlich.  Diese  ersten  Tage  hab  ich  mit  Briefschreiben \r\nzugebracht,  habe  die  Zeichnungen,  die  ich  auf  dem  Lande \r\ngemacht,  ein  wenig  gemustert;  die  nächste  Woche  soll \r\nes  an  neue  Arbeit  gehn.  Es  ist  zu  schmeichelhaft,  als \r\ndaß  ich  es  sagen  dürfte,  was  mir  Angelica  für  Hoflhungen \r\nüber  mein  Landschaftszjichnen,  unter  gewissen  Bedin- \r\ngungen, gibt.  Ich  will  wenigstens  fortfahren,  um  mich \r\ndem  zu  nähern,  was  ich  wohl  nie  erreiche. \r\nIch  erwarte  mit  Verlangen  Nachricht,  daß  Egmont  ange- \r\nlangt, und  wie  ihr  ihn  aufgenommen.  Ich  habe  doch \r\nsclion  geschrieben,  daß  Kayser  herkommt?  Ich  erwarte \r\nihn  in  einigen  Tagen  mit  der  nun  vollendeten  Partitur \r\nunsrer  Skcipinereien.    Du  kannst  denken,  was  das  für  ein \r\n\r\n\r\n444  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nFest  sein  wird!  Sogleich  wird  Hand  an  eine  neue  Oper \r\ngelegt  und  Claudine  mit  Erwin  in  seiner  Gegenwart,  mit \r\nseinem  Beirat  verbessert. \r\n\r\nHerders  \"Ideen\"  habich  nun  durchgelesen  und  habe  mich \r\ndes  Buches  außerordentlich  gefreut.  Der  Schluß  ist  herr- \r\nlich, wahr  und  erquicklich,  und  er  wird,  wie  das  Buch \r\nselbst,  erst  mit  der  Zeit  und  vielleicht  unter  fremdem \r\nNamen  den  Menschen  wohltun.  Je  mehr  diese  Vor- \r\nstellungsart gewinnt,  je  glücklicher  wird  der  nachdenk- \r\nliche Mensch  werden.  Auch  habe  ich  dieses  Jahr  unter \r\nfremden  Menschen  acht  gegeben,  und  gefunden,  daß  alle \r\nwirklich  klugen  Menschen,  mehr  oder  weniger,  zarter  oder \r\ngröber,  darauf  kommen  und  bestehen,  daß  der  Moment \r\nalles  ist  und  daß  nur  der  Vorzug  eines  vernünftigen \r\nMenschen  darin  bestehe,  sich  so  zu  betragen,  daß  sein \r\nLeben,  insofern  es  von  ihm  abhängt,  die  möglichste  Masse \r\nvon  vernünftigen,  glücklichen  Momenten  enthalte. \r\nIch  müßte  wieder  ein  Buch  schreiben,  wenn  ich  sagen \r\nsollte,  was  ich  bei  dem  und  jenem  Buch  gedacht  habe. \r\nIch  lese  jetzt  wieder  Stellen,  so  wie  ich  sie  aufschlage, \r\num  mich  an  jeder  Seite  zu  ergötzen;  denn  es  ist  durch- \r\naus köstlich  gedacht  und  geschrieben. \r\nBesonders  schön  find  ich  das  griechische  Zeitalter;  daß \r\nich  am  römischen,  wenn  ich  mich  so  ausdrücken  darf, \r\netwasKörperhchkeit  vermisse,  kann  man  vielleicht  denken, \r\nohne  daß  ich  es  sage.  Es  ist  auch  natürlich.  Gegenwärtig \r\nruht  in  meinem  Gemüt  die  Masse  des,  was  der  Staat  war, \r\nan  und  für  sich;  mir  ist  er,  wie  Vaterland,  etwas  Aus- \r\nschließendes. Und  ihr  müßtet  im  Verhältnis  mit  dem  Un- \r\ngeheuern Weltganzen  den  Wert  dieser  einzelnen  Existenz \r\nbestimmen,  wo  denn  freilich  vieles  zusammenschrumpfte \r\nund  in  Rauch  aufgehn  mag. \r\n\r\nSo  bleibt  mir  das  Coliseo  immer  imposant,  wenn  ich \r\ngleich  denke,  zu  welcher  Zeit  es  gebaut  worden,  und  daß \r\ndas  Volk,  welches  diesen  ungeheuren  Kreis  ausfüllte,  nicht \r\nmehr  das  altrömische  Volk  war. \r\n\r\nEin  Buch  über  Malerei  und  Bildhauerkunst  in  Rom  ist \r\nauch  zu  uns  gekommen.  Es  ist  ein  deutsches  Produkt  und, \r\nwas  schlimmer  ist,  eines  deutschen  Kavaliers.   Es  scheint \r\n\r\n\r\nROU  1787  445 \r\n\r\nein  junger  Mann  zu  sein,  der  Energie  hat,  aber  voller \r\nPrätension  steckt,  der  sich  Mühe  gegeben  hat,  herumzu- \r\nlaufen, zu  notieren,  zu  hören,  zu  horchen,  zu  lesen.  Er \r\nhat  gewußt  dem  Werke  einen  Anschein  von  Ganzheit  zu \r\ngeben;  es  ist  darin  vielWahres  und  Gutes,  gleich  darneben \r\nFalsches  und  Albernes,  Gedachtes  und  Nachgeschwätztes, \r\nLongueurs  und  Echappaden.  Wer  es  auch  in  der  Ent- \r\nfernung durchsieht,  wird  bald  merken,  welch  monströses \r\nMittelding  zwischen  Kompilation  und  eigen  gedachtem \r\nWerk  dieses  voluminöse  Opus  geworden  sei. \r\nDie  Ankunft  Egmonts  erfreut  und  beruhigt  mich,  und  ich \r\nverlange  auf  ein  Wort  darüber,  das  nun  wohl  unterwegs \r\nist.  Das  Saffianexemplar  ist  angelangt,  ich  hab  es  der \r\nAngelica  gegeben.  Mit  Kaysers  Oper  wollen  wir  es \r\nklüger  machen,  als  man  mis  geraten  hat;  euer  Vorschlag \r\nist  sehr  gut;  wenn  Kayser  kommt,  sollt  ihr  mehr  hören. \r\nDie  Rezension  ist  recht  im  Stil  des  Alten,  zu  viel  und \r\nzu  wenig.  Mir  ist  jetzt  nur  dran  gelegen,  zu  machen^  seit- \r\ndem ich  sehe,  wie  sich  am  Gemachten,  wenn  es  auch  nicht \r\ndas  Vollkommenste  ist,  Jahrtausende  rezensieren,  das \r\nheißt,  etwas  von  seinem  Dasein  hererzählen  läßt. \r\nJedermann  verwundert  sich,  wie  ich  ohne  Tribut  durch- \r\ngekommen bin;  man  weiß  aber  auch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich \r\nbetragen  habe.  Unser  Oktober  war  nicht  der  schönste, \r\nob  wir  gleich  himmlische  Tage  gehabt  haben. \r\nEs  geht  mit  mir  jetzt  eine  neue  Epoche  an.  Mein  Gemüt \r\nist  nun  durch  das  viele  Sehen  und  Erkennen  so  ausge- \r\nweitet, daß  ich  mich  auf  irgend  eine  Arbeit  beschränken \r\nmuß.  Die  Individualität  eines  Menschen  ist  ein  wunder- \r\nlich Ding;  die  meine  hab  ich  jetzt  recht  kennen  lernen, \r\nda  ich  einerseits  dieses  Jahr  bloß  von  mir  selbst  abge- \r\nhangen habe  und  von  der  andern  Seite  mit  völlig  fremden \r\nMenschen  umzugehen  hatte. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nOktober \r\nZu  Anfang  dieses  Monats  bei  mildem,  durchaus  heiterem, \r\nherrlichem  Wetter  genossen  wir  eine  förmliche  Villeg- \r\ngiatur  in  Castel  Gandolfo,  wodurch  wir  uns  denn  in  die \r\n\r\n\r\n446  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nMitte  dieser  unvergleichlichen  Gegend  eingeweiht  und \r\neingebürgert  sahen.  Herr  Jenkins,  der  wohlhabende  eng- \r\nlische Kunsthändler,  bewohnte  daselbst  ein  sehr  statt- \r\nliches Gebäude,  den  ehemaligen  Wohnsitz  des  Jesuiter- \r\ngenerals,  wo  es  einer  Anzahl  von  Freunden  weder  an \r\nZimmern  zu  bequemer  Wohnung,  noch  an  Sälen  zu  heite- \r\nrem Beisammensein,  noch  an  Bogengängen  zu  munterem \r\nLustwandeln  fehlte. \r\n\r\nMan  kann  sich  von  einem  solchen  Herbstaufenthalte  den \r\nbesten  Begriö\"  machen,  wenn  man  sich  ihn  wie  den  Auf- \r\nenthalt in  einem  Badorte  gedenkt.  Personen  ohne  den \r\nmindesten  Bezug  aufeinander  werden  durch  Zufall  augen- \r\nblicklich in  die  unmittelbarste  Nähe  versetzt.  Frühstück \r\nund  Mittagessen,  Spaziergänge,  Lustpartien,  ernst-  und \r\nscherzhafte  Unterhaltung  bewirken  schnell  Bekanntschaft \r\nund  Vertraulichkeit;  da  es  denn  ein  Wunder  wäre,  wenn, \r\nbesonders  hier,  wo  nicht  einmal  Krankheit  und  Kur  eine \r\nArt  von  Diversion  macht,  hier  im  vollkommensten  Müßig- \r\ngange, sich  nicht  die  entschiedensten  Wahlverwandt- \r\nschaften zunächst  hervortun  sollten.  Hofrat  Reiöenstein \r\nhatte  für  gut  befunden,  und  zwar  mit  Recht,  daß  wir \r\nzeitig  hinausgehen  sollten,  um  zu  unseren  Spaziergängen \r\nund  sonstigen  artistischen  Wanderungen  ins  Gebirg  die \r\nnötige  Zeit  zu  finden,  ehe  noch  der  Schwall  der  Gesell- \r\nschaft sich  herandrängte  und  uns  zur  Teilnahme  an  ge- \r\nmeinschaftlicher Unterhaltung  aufforderte.  Wir  waren \r\ndie  ersten  und  versäumten  nicht,  uns  in  der  Gegend, \r\nnach  Anleitung  des  erfahrenen  Führers,  zweckmäßig  um- \r\nzusehen, und  ernteten  davon  die  schönsten  Genüsse  und \r\nBelehrungen. \r\n\r\nNach  einiger  Zeit  sah  ich  eine  gar  hübsche  römische \r\nNachbarin,  nicht  weit  von  uns  im  Korso  wohnend,  mit \r\nihrer  Mutter  heraufkommen.  Sie  hatten  beide,  seit  meiner \r\nMylordschaft,  meine  Begrüßungen  freundlicher  als  sonst \r\nerwidert,  doch  hatte  ich  sie  nicht  angesprochen,  ob  icli \r\ngleich  an  ihnen,  wenn  sie  abends  vor  der  Tür  saßen, \r\nöfters  nah  genug  vorbeiging;  denn  ich  war  dem  (jelübde, \r\nmich  durch  dergleichen  Verhältnisse  von  meinem  Haupt- \r\nzwecke nicht  abhalten  zu  lassen,  vollkommen  treu  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  447 \r\n\r\nblieben.  Nun  aber  fanden  wir  uns  auf  einmal  wie  völlig \r\nalte  Bekannte;  jenes  Konzert  gab  Stoff  genug  zur  ersten \r\nUnterhaltung,  und  es  ist  wohl  nichts  angenehmer  als  eine \r\nRömerin  der  Art,  die  sich  in  natürlichem  Gespräch  heiter \r\ngehen  läßt  und  ein  lebhaftes,  auf  die  reine  Wirklichkeit \r\ngerichtetes  Aufmerken,  eine  Teilnahme  mit  anmutigem \r\nBezug  auf  sich  selbst,  in  der  wohlklingenden  römischen \r\nSprache  schnell,  doch  deutlich  vorträgt,  und  zwar  in \r\neiner  edlen  Mundart,  die  auch  die  mittlere  Klasse  über \r\nsich  selbst  erhebt  und  dem  Allernatürlichsten,  ja  dem \r\nGemeinen  einen  gewissen  Adel  verleiht.  Diese  Eigen- \r\nschaften und  Eigenheiten  waren  mir  zwar  bekannt,  aber \r\nich  hatte  sie  noch  nie  in  einer  so  einschmeichelnden  Folge \r\nvernommen. \r\n\r\nZu  gleicher  Zeit  stellten  sie  mich  einer  jungen  Mailän- \r\nderin vor,  die  sie  mitgebracht  hatten,  der  Schwester  eines \r\nKomniis  von  Herrn  Jenkins,  eines  jungen  Mannes,  der \r\nwegen  Fertigkeit  und  Redlichkeit  bei  seinem  Prinzipal \r\nin  großer  Gunst  stand.  Sie  schienen  genau  miteinander \r\nverbunden  und  Freundinnen  zu  sein. \r\nDiese  beiden  Schönen — denn  schön  durfte  man  sie  wirk- \r\nlich nennen — standen  in  einem  nicht  schroffen,  aber  doch \r\nentschiedenen  Gegensatz:  dunkelbraune  Haare  die  Rö- \r\nmerin, hellbraune  die  Mailänderin;  jene  braun  von  Ge- \r\nsichtsfarbe, diese  klar,  von  zarter  Haut;  diese  zugleich \r\nmit  fast  blauen  Augen,  jene  mit  braunen;  die  Römerin \r\neinigermaßen  ernst,  zurückhaltend,  die  Mailänderin  von \r\neinem  offnen,  nicht  sowohl  ansprechenden  als  gleichsam \r\nanfragenden  Wesen.  Ich  saß  bei  einer  Art  Lottospiel \r\nzwischen  beiden  Frauenzimmern  und  hatte  mit  der  Rö- \r\nmerin Kasse  zusammen  gemacht;  im  Laufe  des  Spiels \r\nfügte  es  sich  nun,  daß  ich  auch  mit  der  Mailänderin \r\nmein  Glück  versuchte,  durch  Wetten  oder  sonst.  Genug, \r\nes  entstand  auch  auf  dieser  Seite  eine  Art  von  Partner- \r\nschaft, wobei  ich  in  meiner  Unschuld  nicht  gleich  be- \r\nmerkte, daß  ein  solches  geteiltes  Interesse  nicht  gefiel, \r\nbis  endlich  nach  aufgehobener  Partie  die  Mutter,  mich \r\nabseits  findend,  zwar  höflich,  aber  mit  wahrhaftem  Ma- \r\ntronenernst dem  werten  Fremden  versicherte:  daß,  da  er \r\n\r\n\r\n448  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\neinmal  mit  ihrer  Tochter  in  solche  Teilnahme  gekommen \r\nsei,  es  sich  nicht  wohl  zieme,  mit  einer  andern  gleiche \r\nVerbindlichkeiten  einzugehen;  man  halte  es  in  einer \r\nVilleggiatur  für  Sitte,  daß  Personen,  die  sich  einmal  auf \r\neinen  gewissen  Grad  verbunden,  dabei  in  der  Gesell- \r\nschaft verharrten  und  eine  unschuldig  anmutige  Wechsel- \r\ngefälligkeit durchführten.  Ich  entschuldigte  mich  aufs \r\nbeste,  jedoch  mit  der  Wendung,  daß  es  einem  Fremden \r\nnicht  wohl  möglich  sei,  dergleichen  Verpflichtungen  an- \r\nzuerkennen, indem  es  in  unsern  Landen  herkömmlich  sei, \r\ndaß  man  den  sämtlichen  Damen  der  Gesellschaft,  einer \r\nwie  der  andern,  mit  und  nach  der  andern,  sich  dienstlich \r\nund  höflich  erweise,  und  daß  dieses  hier  um  desto  mehr \r\ngelten  werde,  da  von  zwei  so  eng  verbundenen  Freun- \r\ndinnen die  Rede  sei. \r\n\r\nAber  leider!  indessen  ich  mich  so  auszureden  suchte, \r\nempfand  ich  auf  die  wundersamste  Weise,  daß  meine \r\nNeigung  für  die  Mailänderin  sich  schon  entschieden  hatte, \r\nblitzschnell  und  eindringlich  genug,  wie  es  einem  müßigen \r\nHerzen  zu  gehen  pflegt,  das  in  selbstgefälligem,  ruhigem \r\nZutrauen  nichts  befürchtet,  nichts  wünscht  und  das  nun \r\nauf  einmal  dem  Wünschenswertesten  unmittelbar  nahe \r\nkommt.  Übersieht  man  doch  in  solchem  Augenblicke \r\ndie  Gefahr  nicht,  die  uns  unter  diesen  schmeichelhaften \r\nZügen  bedroht. \r\n\r\nDen  nächsten  Morgen  fanden  wir  uns  drei  allein,  und  da \r\nvermehrte  sich  denn  das  Übergewicht  auf  die  Seite  der \r\nMailänderin.  Sie  hatte  den  großen  Vorzug  vor  ihrer \r\nFreundin,  daß  in  ihren  Äußerungen  etwas  Strebsames  zu \r\nbemerken  war.  Sie  beklagte  sich  nicht  über  vernach- \r\nlässigte, aber  allzu  ängstliche  Erziehung. \r\nMan  lehrt  uns  nicht  schreiben,  sagte  sie,  weil  man  fürch- \r\ntet, wir  würden  die  Feder  zu  Liebesbriefen  benutzen; \r\nman  würde  uns  nicht  lesen  lassen,  wenn  wir  ims  nicht \r\nmit  dem  Gebetbuch  beschäftigen  müßten;  uns  in  fremden \r\nSprachen  zu  imterrichten,  daran  wird  niemand  denken; \r\nich  gäbe  alles  darum,  Englisch  zu  können.  Herrn  Jcnkins \r\nmit  meinem  Bruder,  Madame  Angelica,  Herrn  Zucchi, \r\ndie  Herren  Volpato  und  Camuccini  hör  ich  oft  sich  unter- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  449 \r\n\r\neinander  englisch  unterhalten,  mit  einem  Gefühl,  das  dem \r\nNeid  ähnlich  ist,  und  die  ellenlangen  Zeitungen  da  liegen \r\nvor  mir  auf  dem  Tische:  es  stehen  Nachrichten  darin  aus \r\nder  ganzen  Welt,  wie  ich  sehe,  und  ich  weiß  nicht,  was \r\nsie  bringen. \r\n\r\n\"Es  ist  desto  mehr  schade,\"  versetzte  ich,  \"da  das  Englische \r\nsich  so  leicht  lernen  läßt;  Sie  müßten  es  in  kurzer  Zeit \r\nfassen  und  begreifen.  Machen  wir  gleich  einen  Versuch\", \r\nfuhr  ich  fort,  indem  ich  eins  der  grenzenlosen  englischen \r\nBlätter  aufhob,  die  häufig  umherlagen. \r\nIch  blickte  schnell  hinein  und  fand  einen  Artikel,  daß  ein \r\nFrauenzimmer  ins  Wasser  gefallen,  glücklich  aber  ge- \r\nrettet und  den  Ihrigen  wiedergegeben  worden.  Es  fanden \r\nsich  Umstände  bei  dem  Falle,  die  ihn  verwickelt  und \r\ninteressant  machten:  es  blieb  zweifelhaft,  ob  sie  sich  ins \r\nWasser  gestürzt,  um  den  Tod  zu  suchen,  sowie  auch, \r\nwelcher  von  ihren  Verehrern,  der  begünstigte  oder  ver- \r\nschmähte, sich  zu  ihrer  Rettung  gewagt.  Ich  wies  ihr  die \r\nStelle  hin  und  bat  sie,  aufmerksam  darauf  zu  schauen. \r\nDarauf  übersetzt  ich  ihr  erst  alle  Substantiva  und  exa- \r\nminierte sie,  ob  sie  auch  ihre  Bedeutimg  wohl  behalten. \r\nGar  bald  überschaute  sie  die  Stellung  dieser  Haupt-  und \r\nGrundworte  und  machte  sich  mit  dem  Platz  bekannt,  den \r\nsie  im  Perioden  eingenommen  hatten.  Ich  ging  darauf \r\nzu  den  einwirkenden,  bewegenden,  bestimmenden  Wor- \r\nten über  und  machte  nunmehr,  wie  diese  das  Ganze  be- \r\nlebten^  auf  das  heiterste  bemerklich  und  katechisierte  sie \r\nso  lange,  bis  sie  mir  endlich,  unaufgefordert,  die  ganze \r\nStelle,  als  stünde  sie  italienisch  auf  dem  Papiere,  vorlas, \r\nwelches  sie  nicht  ohne  Bewegung  ihres  zierlichen  Wesens \r\nleisten  konnte.  Ich  habe  nicht  leicht  eine  so  herzlich \r\ngeistige  Freude  gesehen,  als  sie  ausdrückte,  indem  sie \r\nmir  für  den  Einblick  in  dieses  neue  Feld  einen  allerlieb- \r\nsten Dank  aussprach.  Sie  konnte  sich  kaum  fassen,  indem \r\nsie  die  Möglichkeit  gewahrte,  die  Erfüllung  ihres  sehn- \r\nlichsten Wunsches  so  nahe  und  schon  versuchsweise  er- \r\nreicht zu  sehen. \r\n\r\nDie  Gesellschaft  hatte  sich  vermehrt,  auch  Angelica  war \r\nangekommen:  an  einer  großen  gedeckten  Tafel  hatte  man \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  29 \r\n\r\n\r\n45 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nihr  mich  rechter  Hand  gesetzt;  meine  Schülerin  stand \r\nan  der  entgegengesetzten  Seite  des  Tisches  und  besann \r\nsich  keinen  Augenblick,  als  die  übrigen  sich  um  die  Tafel- \r\nplätze komplimentierten,  um  den  Tisch  herumzugehen \r\nund  sich  neben  mir  niederzulassen.  Meine  ernste  Nach- \r\nbarin schien  dies  mit  einiger  Verwunderung  zu  bemerken, \r\nund  es  bedurfte  nicht  des  Blicks  einer  klugen  Frau,  um \r\nzu  gewahren,  daß  hier  was  vorgegangen  sein  müsse  imd \r\ndaß  ein  zeither  bis  zur  trockenen  Unhöflichkeit  von  den \r\nFrauen  sich  entfernender  Freund  wohl  selbst  sich  endlich \r\nzahm  und  gefangen  überrascht  gesehen  habe. \r\nIch  hielt  zwar  äußerlich  noch  ziemlich  gut  stand;  eine \r\ninnere  Bewegung  aber  gab  sich  wohl  eher  kund  durch \r\neine  gewisse  Verlegenheit,  in  der  ich  mein  Gespräch \r\nzwischen  den  Nachbarinnen  teilte,  indem  ich  die  ältere \r\nzarte,  diesmal  schweigsame  Freundin  belebend  zu  unter- \r\nhalten, und  jene,  die  sich  immer  noch  in  der  fremden \r\nSprache  zu  ergehen  schien  und  sich  in  dem  Zustande  be- \r\nfand desjenigen,  der,  mit  einem  Mal  von  dem  erwünscht \r\naufgehenden  Lichte  geblendet,  sich  nicht  gleich  in  der \r\nUmgebung  zu  finden  weiß,  durch  eine  freundlich  ruhige, \r\neher  ablehnende  Teilnahme  zu  beschwichtigen  suchte. \r\nDieser  aufgeregte  Zustand  jedoch  hatte  sogleich  die \r\nEpoche  einer  merkwürdigen  Umwälzung  zu  erleben.  Ge- \r\ngen Abend  die  jungen  Frauenzimmer  aufsuchend,  fand \r\nich  die  älteren  Frauen  in  einem  Pavillon,  wo  die  herr- \r\nlichste der  Aussichten  sich  darbot;  ich  schweifte  mit \r\nmeinem  Blick  in  die  Rmide,  aber  es  ging  vor  meinen \r\nAugen  etwas  anders  vor  als  das  landschaftlich  Malerische; \r\nes  hatte  sich  ein  Ton  über  die  Gegend  gezogen,  der  we- \r\nder dem  Untergang  der  Sonne  noch  den  Lüften  des \r\nAbends  allein  zuzuschreiben  war.  Die  glühende  Beleuch- \r\ntung der  hohen  Stellen,  die  kühlende  blaue  Beschattung \r\nder  Tiefe  schien  herrlicher  als  jemals  in  Öl  oder  Aqua- \r\nrell; ich  konnte  nicht  genug  hinsehen,  doch  fühlte  ich, \r\ndaß  ich  den  Platz  zu  verlassen  Lust  hatte,  um  in  teil- \r\nnehmender kleiner  Gesellschaft  dem  letzten  Blick  der \r\nSonne  zu  huldigen. \r\nDoch  hatte  ich  leider  der  Einladung  der  Mutter  und  Nach- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  451 \r\n\r\nbarinnen  nicht  absagen  können,  mich  bei  ihnen  nieder- \r\nzulassen, besonders  da  sie  mir  an  dem  Fenster  der \r\nschönsten  Aussicht  Raum  gemacht  hatten.  Als  ich  auf \r\nihre  Reden  merkte,  könnt  ich  vernehmen,  daß  von  Aus- \r\nstattung die  Rede  sei,  einem  immer  wiederkehrenden \r\nund  nie  zu  erschöpfenden  Gegenstande.  Die  Erforder- \r\nnisse aller  Art  wurden  gemustert,  Zahl  und  BeschaÖen- \r\nheit  der  verschiedenen  Gaben,  Grundgeschenke  der  Fa- \r\nmilie, vielfache  Beiträge  von  Freunden  und  Freundinnen, \r\nteilweise  noch  ein  Geheimnis,  und  was  nicht  alles  in \r\ngenauer  Hererzählung  die  schöne  Zeit  hinnahm,  mußte \r\nvon  mir  geduldig  angehört  werden,  weil  die  Damen  mich \r\nzu  einem  späteren  Spaziergang  festgenommen  hatten. \r\nEndlich  gelangte  denn  das  Gespräch  zu  den  Verdiensten \r\ndes  Bräutigams:  man  schilderte  ihn  günstig  genug,  wollte \r\nsich  aber  seine  jNIängel  nicht  verbergen,  in  getroster \r\nHoffnung,  daß  diese  zu  mildern  und  zu  bessern  die  An- \r\nmut, der  Verstand,  die  Liebenswürdigkeit  seiner  Braut  im \r\nkünftigen  Ehstande  hinreichen  werde. \r\nUngeduldig  zuletzt,  als  eben  die  Sonne  sich  in  das  ent- \r\nfernte Meer  niedersenkte  und  einen  unschätzbaren  Blick \r\ndurch  die  langen  Schatten  und  die  zwar  gedämpften,  doch \r\nmächtigen  Streiflichter  gewährte,  fragt  ich  auf  das  be- \r\nscheidenste, wer  denn  aber  die  Braut  sei.  Mit  Verwun- \r\nderung erwiderte  man  mir,  ob  ich  denn  das  allgemein \r\nBekannte  nicht  wisse?  Und  nun  erst  fiel  es  ihnen  ein, \r\ndaß  ich  kein  Hausgenosse,  sondern  ein  Fremder  sei. \r\nHier  ist  es  freilich  nun  nicht  nötig,  auszusprechen,  welch \r\nEntsetzen  mich  ergriff,  als  ich  vernahm,  es  sei  eben  die \r\nkurz  erst  so  liebgewonnene  Schülerin.  Die  Sonne  ging \r\nunter,  und  ich  wußte  mich  unter  irgend  einem  Vorwand \r\nvon  der  Gesellschaft  loszumachen,  die,  ohne  es  zu  wissen, \r\nmich  auf  eine  so  grausame  Weise  belehrt  hatte. \r\nDaß  Neigungen,  denen  man  eine  Zeitlang  unvorsichtig \r\nnachgegeben,  endlich  aus  dem  Traume  geweckt,  in  die \r\nschmerzlichsten  Zustände  sich  umwandeln,  ist  herkömm- \r\nlich und  bekannt;  aber  vielleicht  interessiert  dieser  Fall \r\ndurch  das  Seltsame,  daß  ein  lebhaftes  wechselseitiges \r\nWohlwollen  in  dem  Ausrenblicke  des  Keimens  zerstört \r\n\r\n\r\n452  ITALIRNISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nwird  und  damit  die  Vorahnung  alles  des  Glücks,  das  ein \r\nsolches  Gefühl  sich  in  künftiger  Entwickelung  unbegrenzt \r\nvorspiegelt.  Ich  kam  spät  nach  Hause,  und  des  andern \r\nMorgens  früh  machte  ich,  meine  Mappe  unter  dem  Arm, \r\neinen  weiteren  Weg.  mit  der  Entschuldigung,  nicht  zur \r\nTafel  zu  kommen. \r\n\r\nIch  hatte  Jahre  und  Erfahrungen  hinreichend,  um  mich, \r\nobwohl  schmerzhaft,  doch  auf  der  Stelle  zusammen- \r\nzunehmen. Es  wäre  wunderbar  genug,  rief  ich  aus,  wenn \r\nein  Werther-ähnliches  Schicksal  dich  in  Rom  aufgesucht \r\nhätte,  um  dir  so  bedeutende,  bisher  wohlbewahrte  Zu- \r\nstände zu  verderben. \r\n\r\nIch  wendete  mich  abermals  rasch  zu  der  inzwischen \r\nvernachlässigten  landschaftlichen  Natur  und  suchte  sie  so \r\ntreu  als  möglich  nachzubilden;  mehr  aber  gelang  mir,  sie \r\nbesser  zu  sehen.  Das  wenige  Technische,  was  ich  besaß, \r\nreichte  kaum  zu  dem  unscheinbarsten  Umriß  hin,  aber \r\ndie  Fülle  der  Körperlichkeit,  die  uns  jene  Gegend  in \r\nFelsen  und  Bäumen,  Auf-  und  Abstiegen,  stillen  Seen, \r\nbelebten  Bächen  entgegenbringt,  war  meinem  Auge  bei- \r\nnahe fühlbarer  als  sonst,  und  ich  konnte  dem  Schmerz \r\nnicht  feind  werden,  der  mir  den  innern  und  äußern  Sinn \r\nin  dem  Grade  zu  schärfen  geeignet  war. \r\nVon  nun  an  aber  hab  ich  mich  kurz  zu  fassen.  Die \r\nMenge  von  Besuchenden  füllte  das  Haus  und  die  Häuser \r\nder  Nachbarschaft;  man  konnte  sich  ohne  Aftektation \r\nvermeiden,  und  eine  wohlempfundene  Höflichkeit,  zu  der \r\nuns  eine  solche  Neigung  stimmt,  ist  in  der  Gesellschaft \r\nüberall  gut  aufgenommen.  Mein  Betragen  gefiel,  und  ich \r\nhatte  keine  Unannehmlichkeit,  keinen  Zwist,  außer  ein \r\neinziges  Mal  mit  dem  Wirt,  Herrn  Jenkins.  Ich  hatte \r\nnämlich  von  einer  weiten  Berg-  und  Waldtour  die  appe- \r\ntitlichsten Pilze  mitgebracht  und  sie  dem  Koch  über- \r\ngeben, der,  über  eine  zwar  seltene,  aber  in  jenen  Ge- \r\ngenden sehr  berühmte  Speise  höchst  vergnügt,  sie  aufs \r\nschmackhafteste  zubereitet  aufdie  Tafel  gab.  Sie  schmeck- \r\nten jedermann  ganz  herrlich;  nur  als  zu  meinen  Ehren \r\nverraten  wurde,  daß  ich  sie  aus  der  Wildnis  mitgebracht, \r\nergrimmte  unser  englischer  Wirt,  obgleich  nur  im  ver- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  453 \r\n\r\nborgenen,  darüber,  daß  ein  Fremder  eine  Speise  zum \r\nGastmahl  beigetragen  habe,  von  welcher  der  Hausherr \r\nnichts  wisse,  die  er  nicht  befohlen  und  angeordnet;  es \r\nzieme  sich  nicht  wohl,  jemanden  an  seiner  eignen  Tafel \r\nzu  überraschen,  Speisen  aufzusetzen,  von  denen  er  nicht \r\nRechenschaft  geben  könne.  Dies  alles  mußte  mir  Rat \r\nReiffenstein  nach  Tafel  diplomatisch  eröffnen,  wogegen \r\nich,  der  ich  an  ganz  anderm  Weh,  als  das  sich  von \r\nSchwäramen  herleiten  kann,  innerlichst  zu  dulden  hatte, \r\nbescheidentlich  erwiderte,  ich  hätte  vorausgesetzt,  der \r\nKoch  würde  das  dem  Herrn  melden,  und  versicherte, \r\nwenn  mir  wieder  dergleichen  Edulien  unterwegs  in  die \r\nHände  kämen,  solche  unserm  trefflichen  Wirte  selbst \r\nzur  Prüfung  und  Genehmigung  vorzulegen.  Denn  wenn \r\nman  billig  sein  will,  muß  man  gestehen:  sein  Verdruß \r\nentsprang  daher,  daß  diese  überhaupt  zweideutige  Speise \r\nohne  gehörige  Untersuchung  auf  die  Tafel  gekommen \r\nwar.  Der  Koch  freilich  hatte  mir  versichert  und  brachte \r\nauch  dem  Herrn  ins  Gedächtnis,  daß  dergleichen,  zwar \r\nnicht  oft,  aber  doch  immer,  als  besondere  Rarität,  mit \r\ngroßem  Beifall  in  dieser  Jahrszeit  vorgesetzt  worden. \r\nDieses  kulinarische  Abenteuer  gab  mir  Anlaß,  in  stillem \r\nHumor  zu  bedenken,  daß  ich,  selbst  von  einem  ganz \r\neignen  Gifte  angesteckt,  in  Verdacht  gekommen  sei, \r\ndurch  gleiche  Unvorsichtigkeit  eine  ganze  Gesellschaft \r\nzu  vergiften. \r\n\r\nEs  war  leicht,  meinen  gefaßten  Vorsatz  fortzuführen.  Ich \r\nsuchte  sogleich  den  englischen  Studien  auszuweichen,  in- \r\ndem ich  mich  morgens  entfernte  und  meiner  heimlich \r\ngeliebten  Schülerin  niemals  anders  als  im  Zusammentritt \r\nvon  mehrern  Personen  zu  nähern  wußte. \r\nGar  bald  legte  sich  auch  dieses  Verhältnis  in  meinem  so \r\nviel  beschäftigten  Gemüte  wieder  zurechte,  und  zwar  auf \r\neine  sehr  anmutige  Weise;  denn  indem  ich  sie  als  Braut, \r\nals  künftige  Gattin  ansah,  erhob  sie  sich  vor  meinen \r\nAugen  aus  dem  trivialen  Mädchenzustande,  und  indem \r\nich  ihr  nun  eben  dieselbe  Neigung,  aber  in  einem  höhern \r\nuneigennützigen  Begriff  zuwendete,  so  war  ich  als  einer, \r\nder   ohnehin  nicht  mehr  einem  leichtsinnigen  Jüngling \r\n\r\n\r\n454  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nglich,  gar  bald  gegen  sie  in  dem  freundlichsten  Behagen. \r\nMein  Dienst,  wenn  man  eine  freie  Aufmerksamkeit  so \r\nnennen  darf,  bezeichnete  sich  durchaus  ohne  Zudring- \r\nlichkeit und  beim  Begegnen  eher  mit  einer  Art  von  Ehr- \r\nfurcht. Sie  aber,  welche  nun  auch  wohl  wußte,  daß  ihr \r\nVerhältnis  mir  bekannt  geworden,  konnte  mit  meinem \r\nBenehmen  vollkommen  zufrieden  sein.  Die  übrige  Welt \r\naber,  weil  ich  mich  mit  jedermann  unterhielt,  merkte \r\nnichts  oder  hatte  kein  Arges  daran,  und  so  gingen  Tage \r\nund  Stunden  einen  ruhigen  behaglichen  Gang. \r\nVon  der  mannigfaltigsten  Unterhaltung  wäre  viel  zusagen. \r\nGenug,  es  war  auch  ein  Theater  daselbst,  wo  der  von \r\nuns  so  oft  im  Karneval  beklatschte  Pulcinell,  welcher  die \r\nübrige  Zeit  sein  Schusterhandwerk  trieb  und  auch  übri- \r\ngens hier  als  ein  anständiger  kleiner  Bürger  erschien, \r\nuns  mit  seinen  pantomimisch-mimisch  lakonischen  Ab- \r\nsurditäten aufs  beste  zu  vergnügen  und  uns  in  die  so \r\nhöchst  behagliche  Nullität  des  Daseins  zu  versetzen \r\nwußte. \r\n\r\nBriefe  von  Haus  hatten  mich  indessen  bemerken  lassen, \r\ndaß  meine  nach  Italien  so  lang  projektierte,  immer  ver- \r\nschobene und  endlich  so  rasch  unternommene  Reise  bei \r\nden  Zurückgelassenen  einige  Unruhe  und  Ungeduld  er- \r\nregt, ja  sogar  den  Wunsch,  mir  nachzufolgen  und  das \r\ngleiche  Glück  zu  genießen,  von  dem  meine  heitern,  auch \r\nwohl  unterrichtenden  Briefe  den  günstigsten  Begrilf  gaben. \r\nFreilich  in  dem  geistreichen  und  kunstliebenden  Kreise \r\nunserer  Herzogin  Amalia  war  es  herkömmlich,  daß  Italien \r\njederzeit  als  das  neue  Jerusalem  wahrer  Gebildeten  be- \r\ntrachtet wurde  und  ein  lebhaftes  Streben  dahin,  wie  es \r\nnur  IN'Iignon  ausdrücken  konnte,  sich  immer  in  Herz  und \r\nSinn  erhielt.  Der  Damm  war  endlich  gebrochen,  und  es \r\nergab  sich  nach  und  nach  ganz  deutlich,  daß  Herzogin \r\nAmalie  mit  ihrer  Umgebung  von  einer,  Herder  und  der \r\njüngere  Dalberg  von  der  andern  Seite  über  die  Alpen  zu \r\ngehen  ernstliche  Anstalt  machten.  Mein  Rat  war,  sie \r\nmöchten  den  Winter  vorübergehen  lassen,  in  der  mitt- \r\nleren Jahrszeit  bis  Rom  gelangen  und  sodann  weiter  nach \r\nund  nach  alles  des  Guten  genießen,  was  die  Umgegend \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  455 \r\n\r\nder  alten  Weltstadt  usw.  der  untere  Teil  von  Italien  dar- \r\nbieten könnte. \r\n\r\nDieser  mein  Rat,  redlich  und  sachgemäß  wie  er  war,  be- \r\nzog sich  denn  doch  auch  auf  meinen  eigenen  Vorteil. \r\nMerkwürdige  Tage  meines  Lebens  hatte  ich  bisher  in \r\ndem  fremdesten  Zustande  mit  ganz  fremden  Menschen \r\ngelebt  und  mich  eigentlich  wieder  frisch  des  humanen \r\nZustands  erfreut,  dessen  ich  in  zwar  zufälligen,  aber  doch \r\nnatürlichen  Bezügen  seit  langer  Zeit  erst  wieder  gewahr \r\nwurde,  da  ein  geschlossener  heimatlicher  Kreis,  ein \r\nLeben  unter  völlig  bekannten  und  verwandten  Personen \r\nuns  am  Ende  in  die  wunderlichste  Lage  versetzt.  Hier \r\nist  es,  wo  durch  ein  wechselseitiges  Dulden  und  Tragen, \r\nTeilnehmen  und  Entbehren  ein  gewisses  Mittelgefühl \r\nvon  Resignation  entsteht,  daß  Schmerz  und  Freude,  Ver- \r\ndruß und  Behagen  sich  in  herkömmlicher  Gewohnheit \r\nwechselseitig  vernichten.  Es  erzeugt  sich  gleichsam  eine \r\nMittelzahl,  die  den  Charakter  der  einzelnen  Ergebnisse \r\ndurchaus  aufhebt,  so  daß  man  zuletzt,  im  Streben  nach \r\nBequemlichkeit,  weder  dem  Schmerz  noch  der  Freude \r\nsich  mit  freier  Seele  hingeben  kann. \r\nErgrifien  von  diesen  Gefühlen  und  Ahnungen,  fühlte  ich \r\nmich  ganz  entschieden,  die  Ankunft  der  Freunde  in  Italien \r\nnicht  abzuwarten.  Denn  daß  meine  Art,  die  Dinge  zu \r\nsehen,  nicht  sogleich  die  ihrige  sein  würde,  konnte  ich \r\nimi  so  deutlicher  wissen,  als  ich  mich  selbst  seit  einem \r\nJahre  jenen  kimmerischen  Vorstellungen  und  Denkweisen \r\ndes  Nordens  zu  entziehen  gesucht  und  unter  einem \r\nhimmelblauen  Gewölbe  mich  freier  umzuschauen  und  zu \r\natmen  gewöhnt  hatte.  In  der  mittlem  Zeit  waren  mir  aus \r\nDeutschland  kommende  Reisende  immerfort  höchst  be- \r\nschwerlich: sie  suchten  das  auf,  was  sie  vergessen  sollten, \r\nund  konnten  das,  was  sie  schon  lange  gewünscht  hatten, \r\nnicht  erkennen,  wenn  es  ihnen  vor  Augen  lag.  Ich  selbst \r\nfand  es  noch  immer  mühsam  genug,  durch  Denken  und \r\nTun  mich  auf  dem  Wege  zu  erhalten,  den  ich  als  den \r\nrechten  anzuerkennen  mich  entschieden  hatte. \r\nFremde  Deutsche  könnt  ich  vermeiden;  so  nah  verbun- \r\ndene, verehrte,  geliebte  Personen  aber  hätten  mich  durch \r\n\r\n\r\n456  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\neignes  Irren  und  Halbgewahrwerden,  ja  selbst  diirch \r\nEingehen  in  meine  Denkweise  gestört  und  gehindert.  Der \r\nnordische  Reisende  glaubt,  er  komme  nach  Rom,  um  ein \r\nSupplement  seines  Daseins  zu  finden,  auszufüllen,  was \r\nihm  fehlt;  allein  er  wird  erst  nach  und  nach  mit  großer \r\nUnbehaglichkeit  gewahr,  daß  er  ganz  den  Sinn  ändern \r\nund  von  vorn  anfangen  müsse. \r\n\r\nSo  deutlich  nun  auch  ein  solches  Verhältnis  mir  erschien, \r\nso  erhielt  ich  mich  doch  über  Tag  und  Stunde  weislich \r\nim  ungewissen  und  fuhr  unablässig  fort  in  der  sorgfältig- \r\nsten Benutzung  der  Zeit.  Unabhängiges  Nachdenken, \r\nAnhören  von  andern.  Beschauen  künstlerischen  Bestre- \r\nbens, eigene  praktische  Versuche  wechselten  unaufhörlich \r\noder  griffen  vielmehr  wechselseitig  ineinander  ein. \r\nHiebei  förderte  mich  besonders  die  Teilnahme  Heinrich \r\nMeyers  von  Zürich,  dessen  Unterhaltung  mir,  obgleicli \r\nseltener,  günstig  zustatten  kam,  indem  er,  als  ein \r\nfleißiger  und  gegen  sich  selbst  strenger  Künstler,  die \r\nZeit  besser  anzuwenden  wußte  als  der  Kreis  von  jüngeren, \r\ndie  einen  ernsten  Fortschritt  in  Begriffen  und  Technik \r\nmit  einem  raschen  lustigen  Leben  leichtniütig  zu  verbin- \r\nden glaubten. \r\n\r\nNovember \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  j.  Novembe'-. \r\nKayser  ist  angekommen,  und  ich  habe  drüber  die  ganze \r\nWoche  nicht  geschrieben.  Er  ist  erst  am  Klavierstimmen, \r\nund  nach  und  nach  wird  die  Oper  vorgetragen  werden. \r\nEs  macht  seine  Gegenwart  wieder  eine  sonderbare  an- \r\nschließende Epoche,  und  ich  sehe,  man  soll  seinen  Weg \r\nnur  ruhig  fortgehn,  die  Tage  bringen  das  Beste  wie  das \r\nSchlimmste. \r\n\r\nDie  Aufnahme  meines  Egmont  macht  mich  glücklich,  und \r\nich  hofte,  er  soll  beim  Wiederlesen  nicht  verlieren;  denn \r\nich  weiß,  was  ich  hineingearbeitet  habe,  und  daß  sich \r\ndas  nicht  auf  einmal  herauslesen  läßt.  Das,  was  ihr  daran \r\nlobt,  habe  icli  machen  wollen;  wenn  ihr  sagt,  daß  es  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  457 \r\n\r\nmacht  ist,  so  habe  ich  meinen  Endzweck  erreicht.  Es \r\nwar  eine  unsäglich  schwere  Aufgabe,  die  ich  ohne  eine \r\nungemessene  Freiheit  des  Lebens  und  des  Gemüts  nie \r\nzustande  gebracht  hätte.  Man  denke,  was  das  sagen  wiU: \r\nein  Werk  vornehmen,  was  zwölf  Jahre  früher  geschrieben \r\nist,  es  vollenden,  ohne  es  umzuschreiben.  Die  besondern \r\nUmstände  der  Zeit  haben  mir  die  Arbeit  erschwert  und \r\nerleichtert.  Nun  liegen  noch  so  zwei  Steine  vor  mir: \r\nFaust  und  Tasso.  Da  die  barmherzigen  Götter  mir  die \r\nStrafe  des  Sisyphus  auf  die  Zukunft  erlassen  zu  haben \r\nscheinen,  hoffe  ich  auch  diese  Klumpen  den  Berg  hinauf- \r\nzubringen. Bin  ich  einmal  damit  oben,  dann  soll  es  aufs \r\nneue  angehn,  und  ich  will  mein  möglichstes  tun,  euren \r\nBeifall  zu  verdienen,  da  ihr  mir  eure  Liebe  ohne  mein \r\nVerdienst  schenkt  und  erhaltet. \r\n\r\nWas  du  von  Klärchen  sagst,  verstehe  ich  nicht  ganz  und \r\nerwarte  deinen  nächsten  Brief.  Ich  sehe  wohl,  daß  dir \r\neine  Nuance  zwischen  der  Dirne  und  der  Göttin  zu  fehlen \r\nscheint.  Da  ich  aber  ihr  Verhältnis  zu  Egmont  so  aus- \r\nschließlich gehalten  habe;  da  ich  ihre  Liebe  mehr  in  den \r\nBegriff  der  Vollkommenheit  des  Geliebten,  ihr  Entzücken \r\nmehr  in  den  Genuß  des  Unbegreiflichen,  daß  dieser \r\nMann  ihr  gehört,  als  in  die  Sinnlichkeit  setze;  da  ich  sie \r\nals  Heldin  auftreten  lasse;  da  sie  im  innigsten  Gefühl  der \r\nEwigkeit  der  Liebe  ihrem  Geliebten  nachgeht  und  end- \r\nlich vor  seiner  Seele  durch  einen  verklärenden  Traum \r\nverherrlicht  wird:  so  weiß  ich  nicht,  wo  ich  die  Zwischen- \r\nnuance hinsetzen  soll,  ob  ich  gleich  gestehe,  daß  aus \r\nNotdurft  des  dramatischen  Pappen-  und  Lattenwerks  die \r\nSchattierungen,  die  ich  oben  hererzähle,  vielleicht  zu \r\nabgesetzt  und  unverbunden  oder  vielmehr  durch  zu  leise \r\nAndeutungen  verbunden  sind;  vielleicht  hilft  ein  zweites \r\nLesen,  vielleicht  sagt  mir  dein  folgender  Brief  etwas \r\nNäheres. \r\n\r\nAngelica  hat  ein  Titelkupfer  zum  Egmont  gezeichnet, \r\nLips  gestochen,  das  wenigstens  in  Deutschland  nicht  ge- \r\nzeichnet, nicht  gestochen  worden  wäre. \r\n\r\nLeider  muß  ich  jetzt  die  bildende  Kunst  ganz  zurück- \r\n\r\n\r\n458  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  IH \r\n\r\nsetzen,  denn  sonst  werde  ich  mit  meinen  dramatischen \r\nSachen  nicht  fertig,  die  auch  eine  eigne  SaramUmg  und \r\nruhige  Bearbeitung  fordern,  wenn  etwas  daraus  werden \r\nsoll.  Claudine  ist  nun  in  der  Arbeit,  wird  sozusagen  ganz \r\nneu  ausgeführt  und  die  alte  Spreu  meiner  Existenz  heraus- \r\ngeschwungen. \r\n\r\nDen  lo.  November. \r\nKayser  ist  nun  da,  und  es  ist  ein  dreifach  Leben,  da  die \r\nMusik  sich  anschließt.  Es  i.st  ein  trefflich  guter  Mann \r\nund  paßt  zu  uns,  die  wir  wirklich  ein  Naturleben  führen, \r\nwie  es  nur  irgend  auf  dem  Erdboden  möglich  ist.  Tisch- \r\nbein kommt  von  Neapel  zurück,  und  da  muß  beider \r\nQuartier  und  alles  verändert  werden,  doch  bei  unsern \r\nguten  Naturen  wird  alles  in  acht  Tagen  wieder  im  Gleis \r\nsein. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  der  Herzogin  Mutter  den  Vorschlag  getan,  sie \r\nsoll  mir  erlauben,  die  Summe  von  zweihundert  Zerhinen, \r\nnach  und  nach,  für  sie  in  verschiedenen  kleinen  Kunst- \r\nwerken auszugeben.  Unterstütze  diesen  Vorschlag,  wie \r\ndu  ihn  in  meinem  Briefe  findest.  Ich  brauche  das  Geld \r\nnicht  gleich,  nicht  auf  einmal.  Es  ist  dieses  ein  wichtiger \r\nPunkt,  dessen  ganzen  Umfang  du  ohne  große  Entwicklung \r\nempfinden  wirst,  und  du  würdest  die  Notwendigkeit  und \r\nNützlichkeit  meines  Rats  und  Erbietens  noch  mehr  er- \r\nkennen, wenn  du  die  Verhältnisse  hier  wüßtest,  die  vor \r\nmir  liegen  wie  meine  Hand.  Ich  bereite  ihr  durch \r\nKleinigkeiten  großes  Vergnügen,  und  wenn  sie  die  Sachen, \r\ndie  ich  nach  und  nach  machen  lasse,  hier  findet,  so  stille \r\nich  die  Begierde,  zu  besitzen,  die  bei  jedem  Ankömmling, \r\ner  sei  wer  er  wolle,  entsteht  und  welche  sie  nur  mit  einer \r\nschmerzlichen  Resignation  unterdrücken  oder  mit  Kosten \r\nund  Schaden  befriedigen  könnte.  Es  ließen  sich  davon \r\nnoch  Blätter  vollschreiben. \r\n\r\nDaß  mein  Egmont  Beifall  erhält,  freut  mich  herzlich. \r\nKein  Stück  hab  ich  mit  mehr  Freiheit  des  Gemüts  und \r\nmit  mehr  Gewissenhaftigkeit  vollbracht  als  dieses;  doch \r\nfällt  es  schwer,  wenn  man  schon  anderes  gemacht  hat, \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  459 \r\n\r\ndem  Leser  genug  zu  tun:  er  verlangt  immer  etwas,  wie \r\ndas  vorige  war. \r\n\r\nDen  24.  November. \r\nDu  fragst  in  deinem  letzten  Briefe  wegen  der  Farbe  der \r\nLandschaft  dieser  Gegenden.  Darauf  kann  ich  dir  sagen, \r\ndaß  sie  bei  heitern  Tagen,  besonders  des  Herbstes,  so \r\nfarbig  ist,  daß  sie  in  jeder  Nachbildung  bunt  scheinen \r\nmuß.  Ich  hoffe  dir  in  einiger  Zeit  einige  Zeichnungen  zu \r\nschicken,  die  ein  Deutscher  macht,  der  jetzt  in  Neapel \r\nist;  die  Wasserfarben  bleiben  so  weit  unter  dem  Glanz \r\nder  Natur,  und  doch  werdet  ihr  glauben,  es  sei  unmög- \r\nlich. Das  Schönste  dabei  ist,  daß  die  lebhaften  Farben, \r\nin  geringer  Entfernung  schon,  durch  den  Luftton  gemil- \r\ndert werden,  und  daß  die  Gegensätze  von  kalten  und \r\nwarmen  Tönen — -wie  man  sie  nennt — so  sichtbar  dastehn. \r\nDie  blauen  klaren  Schatten  stechen  so  reizend  von  allem \r\nerleuchteten  Grünen,  Gelblichen,  Rötlichen,  Bräunlichen \r\nab  und  verbinden  sich  mit  der  bläulich  duftigen  Ferne. \r\nEs  ist  ein  Glanz  und  zugleich  eine  Harmonie,  eine  Ab- \r\nstufung im  Ganzen,  wovon  man  nordwärts  gar  keinen \r\nBegriff  hat.  Bei  euch  ist  alles  entweder  hart  oder  trüb, \r\nbunt  oder  eintönig.  Wenigstens  erinnere  ich  mich  selten \r\neinzelne  Efiekte  gesehen  zu  haben,  die  mir  einen  Vor- \r\nschmack  von  dem  gaben,  was  jetzt  täglich  und  stündlich \r\nvor  mir  steht.  Vielleicht  fände  ich  jetzt,  da  mein  Auge \r\ngeübter  ist,  auch  nordwärts  mehr  Schönheiten. \r\nÜbrigens  kann  ich  wohl  sagen,  daß  ich  nun  fast  die  rechten \r\ngeraden  Wege  zu  allen  bildenden  Künsten  vor  mir  sehe \r\nund  erkenne,  aber  auch  nun  ihre  Weiten  und  Fernen \r\ndesto  klarer  ermesse.  Ich  bin  schon  zu  alt,  um  von  jetzt \r\nan  mehr  zu  tun  als  zu  pfuschen;  wie  es  andre  treiben, \r\nseh  ich  auch,  finde  manchen  auf  dem  guten  Pfade,  keinen \r\nmit  großen  Schritten.  Es  ist  also  auch  damit,  wie  mit \r\nGlück  und  Weisheit,  davon  uns  die  Urbilder  nur  vor- \r\nschweben, deren  Kleidsaum  wir  höchstens  berühren. \r\nKaysers  Ankunft,  und  bis  wir  uns  ein  wenig  mit  ihm  in \r\nhäusliche  Ordnung  setzten,  hatte  mich  einigermaßen \r\nzurückgebracht;  meine  Arbeiten  stockten.    Jetzt  geht  es \r\n\r\n\r\n46o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nwieder,  und  meine  Opern  sind  nahe,  fertig  zu  sein.  Er \r\nist  sehr  brav,  verständig,  ordentlich,  gesetzt,  in  seiner \r\nKunst  so  fest  und  sicher,  als  man  sein  kann,  einer  von \r\ndenen  Menschen,  durch  deren  Nähe  man  gesunder  wird. \r\nDabei  hat  er  eine  Herzensgüte,  einen  richtigen  Lebens- \r\nund Gesellschaftsblick,  wodurch  sein  übrigens  strenger \r\nCharakter  biegsamer  wird  und  sein  Umgang  eine  eigene \r\nGrazie  gewinnt. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nNovember \r\n\r\nNun  aber  bei  dem  stillen  Gedanken  an  ein  allmähliches \r\nLoslösen  ward  ein  neues  Anknüpfen  durch  die  Ankunft \r\neines  wackeren  früheren  Freundes  vorbereitet,  des  Chri- \r\nstoph Kayser,  eines  gebornen  Frankfurters,  der  zu  gleicher \r\nZeit  mit  Klingern  und  uns  andern  herangekommen  war. \r\nDieser,  von  Natur  mit  eigentümlichem  musikalischem  Ta- \r\nlente begabt,  hatte  schon  vor  Jahren,  indem  er  Scherz, \r\nList  und  Rache  zu  komponieren  unternahm ,  auch  eine \r\nzu  Egmont  passende  Musik  zu  liefern  begonnen.  Ich \r\nhatte  ihm  von  Rom  aus  gemeldet,  das  Stück  sei  abge- \r\ngangen und  eine  Kopie  in  meinen  Händen  geblieben. \r\nStatt  weitläufiger  Korrespondenz  darüber  ward  rätlich \r\ngefunden,  er  solle  selbst  unverzüglich  herankommen;  da \r\ner  denn  auch  nicht  säumend  mit  dem  Kurier  durch  Italien \r\nhindurchflog,  sehr  bald  bei  uns  eintraf  und  in  den \r\nKünstlerkreis,  der  sein  Hauptciuartier  im  Korso,  Ron- \r\ndanini gegenüber,  aufgeschlagen  hatte,  sich  freundlich \r\naufgenommen  sah. \r\n\r\nHier  aber  zeigte  sich  gar  bald,  statt  des  so  nötigen \r\nSammeins  und  Einens,  neue  Zerstreuung  und  Zeitsplitte- \r\nrung. \r\n\r\nVorerst  gingen  mehrere  Tage  hin,  bis  ein  Klavier  bei- \r\ngeschafft, probiert,  gestimmt  und  nach  des  eigensinnigen \r\nKünstlers  Willen  und  Wollen  zurecht  gerückt  war,  wobei \r\ndenn  immer  noch  etwas  zu  wünschen  und  zu  fordern \r\nübrig  blieb.  Indessen  belohnte  sich  baldigst  der  Aufwand \r\nvon  Mühe  und  Versäumnis  durch  die  Leistungen  eines \r\nsehr  gewandten,  seiner  Zeit  völlig  gemäßen,  die  damaligen \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  461 \r\n\r\nschwierigsten  Werke  leicht  vortragenden  Talentes.  Und \r\ndamit  der  musikalische  Geschichtskenner  sogleich  wisse, \r\nwovon  die  Rede  sei,  bemerke  ich,  daß  zu  jener  Zeit \r\nSchubart  für  unerreichbar  gehalten,  sodann  auch,  daß  als \r\nProbe  eines  geübten  Klavierspielers  die  Ausführung  von \r\nVariationen  geachtet  wurde,  wo  ein  einfaches  Thema, \r\nauf  die  künstlichste  Weise  durchgeführt,  endlich  durch \r\nsein  natürliches  Wiedererscheinen  den  Hörer  zu  iVtem \r\nkommen  ließ. \r\n\r\nDie  Symphonie  zu  Egmont  brachte  er  mit,  und  so  belebte \r\nsich  von  dieser  Seite  mein  ferneres  Bestreben,  welches \r\ngegenwärtig  mehr  als  jemals,  aus  Notwendigkeit  und \r\nLiebhaberei,  gegen  das  musikalische  Theater  gerichtet \r\nwar. \r\n\r\nErwin  und  Elmire  sowie  Claudine  von  Villa  Bella  sollten \r\nnun  auch  nach  Deutschland  abgesendet  werden;  ich  hatte \r\nmich  aber  durch  die  Bearbeitung  Egmonts  in  meinen \r\nForderungen  gegen  mich  selbst  dergestalt  gesteigert,  daß \r\nich  nicht  über  mich  gewinnen  konnte,  sie  in  ihrer  ersten \r\nForm  dahin  zu  geben.  Gar  manches  Lyrische,  das  sie \r\nenthalten,  war  mir  lieb  und  wert;  es  zeugte  von  vielen, \r\nzwar  törig,  aber  doch  glücklich  verlebten  Stunden,  wie \r\nvon  Schmerz  und  Kummer,  welchen  die  Jugend  in  ihrer \r\nunberatenen  Lebhaftigkeit  ausgesetzt  bleibt.  Der  pro- \r\nsaische Dialog  dagegen  erinnerte  zu  sehr  an  jene  fran- \r\nzösischen Operetten,  denen  wir  zwar  ein  freundliches \r\nAndenken  zu  gönnen  haben,  indem  sie  zuerst  ein  heiteres \r\nsingbares  Wesen  auf  unser  Theater  herüberbrachten,  die \r\nmir  aber  jetzt  nicht  mehr  genügen  wollten,  als  einem \r\neingebürgerten  Italiener,  der  den  melodischen  Gesang \r\ndurch  einen  rezitierenden  und  deklamatorischen  wenig- \r\nstens wollte  verknüpft  sehen. \r\n\r\nIn  diesem  Sinne  wird  man  nunmehr  beide  Opern  be- \r\narbeitet finden;  ihre  Kompositionen  haben  hie  und  da \r\nFreude  gemacht,  und  so  sind  sie  auf  dem  dramatischen \r\nStrom  auch  zu  ihrer  Zeit  mit  vorüber  geschwommen. \r\nGewöhnlich  schilt  man  auf  die  italienischen  Texte,  und \r\ndas  zwar  in  solchen  Phrasen,  wie  einer  dem  andern  nach- \r\nsagen kann,  ohne  was  dabei  zu  denken;  sie  sind  freilich \r\n\r\n\r\n462  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nleicht  und  heiter,  aber  sie  machen  nicht  mehr  Forderungen \r\nan  den  Komponisten  und  an  den  Sänger,  als  inwieweit \r\nbeide  sich  hinzugeben  Lust  haben.  Ohne  hierüber  weit- \r\nläufig zu  sein,  erinnere  ich  an  den  Text  der  Heimlichen \r\nHeirat;  man  kennt  den  Verfasser  nicht,  aber  es  war  einer \r\nder  geschicktesten,  die  in  diesem  Fache  gearbeitet  haben, \r\nwer  er  auch  mag  gewesen  sein.  In  diesem  Sinne  zu  han- \r\ndeln, in  gleicher  Freiheit  nach  bestimmten  Zwecken  zu  wir- \r\nken, war  meine  Absicht,  und  ich  wüßte  selbst  nicht  zu \r\nsagen,  inwiefern  ich  mich  meinem  Ziel  genähert  habe. \r\nLeider  aber  war  ich  mit  Freund  Kayser  seit  geraumer \r\nZeit  schon  in  einem  Unternehmen  befangen,  das  nach \r\nund  nach  immer  bedenklicher  und  weniger  ausführbar \r\nschien. \r\n\r\nMan  vergegenwärtige  sich  jene  sehr  imschuldige  Zeit  des \r\ndeutschen  Opernwesens,  wo  noch  ein  einfaches  Inter- \r\nmezzo, wie  die  Serva  Padrona  von  Pergolese,  Eingang \r\nund  Beifall  fand.  Damals  nun  produzierte  sich  ein  deut- \r\nscher BuÖb  namens  Berger,  mit  einer  hübschen,  statt- \r\nlichen, gewandten  Frau,  welche  in  deutschen  Städten \r\nund  Ortschaften,  mit  geringer  Verkleidung  und  schwacher \r\nMusik,  im  Zimmer,  mancherlei  heitere,  aufregende  Vor- \r\nstellungen gaben,  die  denn  freilich  immer  auf  Betrug  und \r\nBeschämung  eines  alten  verliebten  Gecken  auslaufen \r\nmochten. \r\n\r\nIch  hatte  mir  zu  ihnen  eine  dritte  mittlere,  leicht  zu  be- \r\nsetzende Stimme  gedacht,  und  so  war  denn  schon  vor \r\nJahren  das  Singspiel  Scherz,  List  und  Rache  entstanden, \r\ndas  ich  an  Kaysern  nach  Zürich  schickte,  welcher  aber, \r\nals  ein  ernster,  gewissenhafter  Mann,  das  Werk  zu  redlich \r\nangriff  und  zu  ausführlich  behandelte.  Ich  selbst  war  ja \r\nschon  über  das  Maß  des  Intermezzo  hinausgegangen,  und \r\ndas  kleinlich  scheinende  Sujet  hatte  sich  in  so  viel  Sing- \r\nstücke entfaltet,  daß  selbst  bei  einer  vorübergehenden \r\nsparsamen  Musik  drei  Personen  kaum  mit  der  Darstellung \r\nwären  zu  Ende  gekommen.  Nun  hatte  Kayser  die  Arien \r\nausführlich  nach  altem  Schnitt  behandelt,  und  man  darf \r\nsagen  stellenweise  glücklich  genug,  wie  nicht  ohne  An- \r\nmut des  Ganzen. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  463 \r\n\r\nAllein  wie  und  wo  sollte  das  zur  Erscheinung  kommen? \r\nUnglücklicherweise  litt  es,  nach  frühern  Mäßigkeitsprin- \r\nzipien, an  einer  Stimmenmagerkeit;  es  stieg  nicht  weiter \r\nals  bis  zum  Terzett,  und  man  hätte  zuletzt  die  Theriaks- \r\nbüchsen  des  Doktors  gern  beleben  mögen,  um  ein  Chor \r\nzu  gewinnen.  Alles  unser  Bemühen  daher,  uns  im  Ein- \r\nfachen und  Beschränkten  abzuschließen,  ging  verloren, \r\nals  jNIozart  auftrat.  Die  Entführung  aus  dem  Serail  schlug \r\nalles  nieder,  und  es  ist  auf  dem  Theater  von  unserm  so \r\nsorgsam  gearbeiteten  Stück  niemals  die  Rede  gewesen. \r\n\r\nDie  Gegenwart  unseres  Kaysers  erhöhte  und  erweiterte \r\nnun  die  Liebe  zur  Musik,  die  sich  bisher  nur  auf  theatra- \r\nlische Exhibitionen  eingeschränkt  hatte.  Er  war  sorg- \r\nfältig, die  Kirchenfeste  zu  bemerken,  und  wir  fanden  uns \r\ndadurch  veranlaßt,  auch  die  an  solchen  Tagen  aufge- \r\nführten solennen  Musiken  mit  anzuhören.  Wir  fanden \r\nsie  freilich  schon  sehr  weltlich,  mit  vollständigstem  Or- \r\nchester, obgleich  der  Gesang  noch  immer  vorwaltete. \r\nIch  erinnere  mich,  an  einem  Cäcilientage  zum  erstenmal \r\neine  Bravourarie  mit  eingreifendem  Chor  gehört  zu  haben; \r\nsie  tat  auf  mich  eine  außerordentliche  Wirkung,  wie  sie \r\nsolche  auch  noch  immer,  wenn  dergleichen  in  den  Opern \r\nvorkommt,  auf  das  Publikum  ausübt. \r\nNächst  diesem  hatte  Kayser  noch  eine  Tugend,  daß  er \r\nnämlich,  weil  ihm  sehr  um  alte  Musik  zu  tun  war,  ihm \r\nauch  die  Geschichte  der  Tonkunst  ernstlich  zu  erforschen \r\noblag,  sich  in  Bibliotheken  umsah;  wie  denn  sein  treuer \r\nFleiß  besonders  in  der  Minerva  gute  Aufnahme  und \r\nFordernis  gefunden  hatte.  Dabei  aber  hatte  sein  Bücher- \r\nforschen den  Erfolg,  daß  er  uns  auf  die  altern  Kupfer- \r\nwerke des  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  aufmerksam  machte \r\nund  zum  Beispiel  das  Speculum  Romanae  magnificentiae, \r\ndie  Architekturen  von  Lomazzo,  nicht  weniger  die  späteren \r\nAdmiranda  Romae,  und  was  sonst  noch  dergleichen  sein \r\nmochte,  in  Erinnerung  zu  bringen  nicht  unterließ.  Diese \r\nBücher-  und  Blättersammlungen,  zu  denen  wir  andere \r\ndenn  auch  wallfahrteten,  haben  besonders  einen  großen \r\nWert,  wenn  man  sie  in  guten  Abdrücken  vor  sich  sieht: \r\n\r\n\r\n404  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nsie  vergegenwärtigen  jene  frühere  Zeit,  wo  das  AlterLiiui \r\nmit  Ernst  und  Scheu  betrachtet  und  die  Überbleibsel  in \r\ntüchtigem  Charakter  ausgedrückt  wurden.  So  näherte \r\nman  sich  zum  Beispiel  den  Kolossen,  wie  sie  noch  auf \r\ndem  alten  Fleck  im  Garten  Colonna  standen;  die  Halb- \r\nruine des  Septizoniums  Severi  gab  noch  den  ungefähren \r\nBegriff  von  diesem  verschwundenen  Gebäude;  die  Peters- \r\nkirche ohne  Fassade,  das  große  Mittel  ohne  Kuppel,  der \r\nalte  Vatikan,  in  dessen  Hof  noch  Turniere  gehalten  wer- \r\nden konnten,  alles  zog  in  die  alte  Zeit  zurück  und  ließ \r\nzugleich  aufs  deutlichste  bemerken,  was  die  zwei  folgen- \r\nden Jahrhunderte  für  Veränderungen  hervorgerufen  und, \r\nungeachtet  l)edeutender  Hindernisse,  das  Zerstörte  her- \r\nzustellen, das  Versäumte  nachzuholen  getrachtet. \r\n\r\nHeinrich  Meyer  von  Zürich,  dessen  ich  schon  oft  zu  ge- \r\ndenken Ursach  hatte,  so  zurückgezogen  er  lebte,  so  fleißig \r\ner  war,  fehlte  doch  nicht  leicht,  wo  etwas  Bedeutendes  zu \r\nschauen,  zu  erfahren,  zu  lernen  war;  denn  auch  die  übrigen \r\nsuchten  und  wünschten  ihn,  indem  er  sich  in  Gesellschaft \r\nso  bescheiden  als  lehrreich  erwies.  Er  ging  den  sichern, \r\nvon  Winckelmann  und  Mengs  eröffneten  Pfad  ruhig  fort, \r\nund  weil  er  in  der  Seydelmannischcn  Manier  antike  Büsten \r\nmit  Sepia  gar  löblich  darzustellen  wußte,  so  fand  nie- \r\nmand mehr  Gelegenheit  als  er,  die  zarten  Abstufungen \r\nder  frühern  und  spätem  Kunst  zu  prüfen  und  kennen  zu \r\nlernen. \r\n\r\nAls  wir  nun  einen  von  allen  Fremden,  Künstlern,  Kennern \r\nund  Laien  gleich  gewünschten  Besuch  bei  Fackelschein \r\ndem  Museum  sowohl  des  Vatikans  als  auch  des  Kapitols \r\nabzustatten  Anstalt  machten,  so  gesellte  er  sich  uns  zu; \r\nund  ich  finde  unter  meinen  Papieren  einen  seiner  Auf- \r\nsätze, wodurch  ein  solcher  genußreicher  Umgang  durch \r\ndie  herrlichsten  Reste  der  Kunst,  welcher  meistenteils \r\nwie  ein  entzückender,  nach  und  nach  verlöschender  Traum \r\nvor  der  Seele  schwebt,  auch  in  seinen  vorteilhaften  Ein- \r\nwirkungen auf  Kenntnis  und  Einsicht  eine  bleibende  Be- \r\ndeutung erhält. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  17S7  465 \r\n\r\n\"Der  Gebrauch,  die  großen  römischen  Museen,  zum  Bei- \r\nspiel das  Museo  Pio-Clementino  im  Vatikan,  das  Kapi- \r\ntolinische usw.  beim  Licht  von  Wachsfackeln  zu  besehen, \r\nscheinet  in  den  achtziger  Jahren  des  vorigen  Jahrhunderts \r\nnoch  ziemlich  neu  gewesen  zu  sein;  indessen  ist  mir  nicht \r\nbekannt,  wann  er  eigentlich  seinen  Anfang  genommen. \r\n\"Vorteile  der  Fackelbeleuchtung:  Jedes  Stück  wird  nur \r\neinzeln,  abgeschlossen  von  allen  übrigen  betrachtet,  und \r\ndie  Aufmerksamkeit  des  Beschauers  bleibt  lediglich  auf \r\ndasselbe  gerichtet:  dann  erscheinen  in  dem  gewaltigen \r\nwirksamen  Fackellicht  alle  zarten  Nuancen  der  Arbeit \r\nweit  deutlicher;  alle  störenden  Widerscheine  (zumal  bei \r\nglänzend  polierten  Statuen  beschwerlich)  hören  auf,  die \r\nSchatten  werden  entschiedener,  die  beleuchteten  Teile \r\ntreten  heller  hervor.  Ein  Hauptvorteil  aber  ist  unstreitig \r\nder,  daß  ungünstig  aufgestellte  Stücke  hierdurch  das  ihnen \r\ngebührende  Recht  erhalten.  So  konnte  man  zum  Beispiel \r\nden  Laokoon  in  der  Nische,  wo  er  stand,  nur  bei  Fackel- \r\nlicht recht  sehen,  weil  kein  immittelbares  Licht  auf  ihn \r\nfiel,  sondern  bloß  ein  Widerschein  aus  dem  kleinen  runden, \r\nmit  einer  Säulenhalle  umgebenen  Hof  des  Belvedere; \r\ndasselbe  war  der  Fall  mit  dem  Apollo  und  dem  soge- \r\nnannten Antinous  (Merkur).  Noch  nötiger  war  Fackel- \r\nbeleuchtung, um  den  Nil  wie  auch  den  Meleager  zu  sehen \r\nund  ihre  Verdienste  schätzen  zu  können.  Keiner  andern \r\nAntike  ist  Fackelbeleuchtung  so  vorteilhaft  als  dem  so- \r\ngenannten Phocion,  weil  man  nur  dann,  nicht  aber  bei \r\ngewöhnlichem  Licht,  indem  er  ungünstig  aufgestellt  ist, \r\ndie  wundersam  zart  durch  das  einfache  Gewand  durch- \r\nscheinenden Teile  des  Körpers  wahrnehmen  kann.  Schön \r\nnimmt  sich  auch  der  vortreffliche  Sturz  eines  sitzenden \r\nBacchus  aus,  ebenso  das  obere  Teil  einer  Bacchusstatue \r\nmit  schönem  Kopf  und  die  Halbfigur  eines  Triton,  vor \r\nallen  aber  das  Wunder  der  Kunst,  der  nie  genug  zu \r\npreisende  berühmte  Torso. \r\n\r\n\"Die  Denkmale  im  Kapitolinischen  Museum  sind  zwar \r\nüberhaupt  weniger  wichtig  als  die  im  Museo  Pio-Clemen- \r\ntino, doch  gibt  es  einige  von  großer  Bedeutung,  und  man \r\ntut  wohl,  um  sich  von  ihren  Verdiensten  gehörig  zu  unter- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  30 \r\n\r\n\r\n466  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nrichten,  solche  bei  Fackelbeleuchtung  zu  sehen.  Der  so- \r\ngenannte Pyrrhus,  vortrefflich  gearbeitet,  steht  auf  der \r\nTreppe  und  erhält  gar  kein  Tageslicht;  auf  der  Galerie \r\nvor  den  Säulen  steht  eine  schöne  halbe  Figur,  die  für \r\neine  bekleidete  Venus  gehalten  wird,  welche  von  drei \r\nSeiten  schwaches  Licht  erhält.  Die  nackte  Venus,  die \r\nschönste  Statue  dieser  Art  in  Rom,  erscheint  bei  Tages- \r\nlicht nicht  zu  ihrem  Vorteil,  da  sie  in  einem  Eckzimmer \r\naufgestellt  ist,  und  die  sogenannte  schön  bekleidete  Juno \r\nsteht  an  der  Wand  zwischen  Fenstern,  wo  sie  bloß  ein \r\nwenig  Streiflicht  erhält;  auch  der  so  berühmte  Ariadnc- \r\nkopf  im  Miscellaneenzimmer  wird,  außer  bei  Fackellicht, \r\nnicht  in  seiner  ganzen  Herrlichkeit  gesehen.  Und  so  sind \r\nnoch  mehrere  Stücke  dieses  Museums  ungünstig  auf- \r\ngestellt, so  daß  Fackelbeleuchtung  durchaus  notwendig \r\nwird,  wenn  man  solche  recht  sehen  und  nach  Verdiensten \r\nschätzen  soll. \r\n\r\n\"Wie  übrigens  so  vieles,  was  geschieht,  um  die  Mode \r\nmitzumachen,  zum  Mißbrauch  wird,  so  ist  es  auch  mit \r\nder  Fackelbeleuchtung.  Sie  kann  nur  in  dem  Falle  Ge- \r\nwinn bringen,  wenn  verstanden  wird,  wozu  sie  nütze  ist. \r\nMonumente  zu  sehen,  die,  wie  vorhin  von  einigen  be- \r\nrichtet worden,  bloß  verkümmertes  Tageslicht  erhalten, \r\ni.st  sie  notwendig,  indem  alsdann  Höhen  und  Tiefen  und \r\nÜbergang  der  Teile  ineinander  richtiger  erkannt  werden. \r\nVornehmlich  aber  wird  sie  Werken  aus  der  allerbesten \r\nZeit  der  Kunst  günstig  sein,  wenn  nämlich  der,  welcher \r\ndie  Fackel  führt,  und  der  Beschauer  wissen,  worauf  es \r\nankömmt;  sie  wird  die  Massen  derselben  besser  zeigen \r\nund  die  zartesten  Nuancen  der  Arbeit  hervorheben. \r\nWerke  des  alten  Kunststils  hingegen,  die  vom  mächtigen, \r\nund  selbst  die  vom  hohen,  haben  nicht  viel  zu  gewinnen, \r\nwenn  sie  anders  sonst  in  hellem  Lichte  stehen.  Denn  da \r\ndie  Künstler  damals  noch  des  Lichts  und  Schattens  nicht \r\nkundig  waren,  wie  sollten  sie  für  ihre  Arbeiten  auf  Licht \r\nund  Schatten  gerechnet  haben?  So  ist  es  auch  mit  spät \r\ngearbeiteten  Werken,  als  die  Künstler  anfingen,  nach- \r\nlässiger zu  werden,  der  Geschmack  schon  so  weit  gesunken \r\nwar,  daß  auf  Licht  und  Schatten  in  plastischen  Werken \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  467 \r\n\r\nnicht  weiter  geachtet,  die  Lehre  von  den  Massen  vergessen \r\nwar.  Wozu  sollte  Fackelbeleuchtung  an  Monumenten \r\ndieser  Art  dienen?'' \r\n\r\nBei  einer  so  feierlichen  Gelegenheit  ist  es  der  Erinnerung \r\ngemäß,  auch  Herrn  Hirts  zu  gedenken,  der  unserem  Ver- \r\nein auf  mehr  als  eine  Weise  nützlich  und  förderlich  ge- \r\nwesen. Im  Fürstenbergischen  1759  geboren,  fand  er, \r\nnach  zurückgelegten  Studien  der  alten  Schriftsteller,  einen \r\nunwiderstehlichen  Trieb,  sich  nach  Rom  zu  verfügen.  Er \r\nwar  einige  Jahre  früher  daselbst  angekommen  als  ich  und \r\nhatte  sich  auf  die  ernstlichste  Weise  mit  alten  und  neuern \r\nBau-  und  Bildwerken  jeder  Art  bekannt  gemacht  und \r\nsich  zu  einem  unterrichtenden  Führer  von  wißbegierigen \r\nFremden  geeignet.  Auch  mir  erwies  er  diese  Gefälligkeit \r\nmit  aufopfernder  Teilnahme. \r\n\r\nSein  Hauptstudium  war  die  Baukunst,  ohne  daß  er  den \r\nklassischen  Lokalitäten  und  so  viel  andern  Merkwürdig- \r\nkeiten seine  Beachtung  entzogen  hätte.  Seine  theoreti- \r\nschen Ansichten  über  Kunst  gaben  in  dem  streit-  imd \r\nparteisüchtigen  Rom  vielfältige  Gelegenheit  zu  lebhaften \r\nDiskussionen.  Aus  der  Verschiedenheit  der  Ansichten \r\nkommen,  besonders  dort,  wo  immer  und  überall  von \r\nKunst  die  Rede  ist,  gar  mannigfaltig  Hin-  und  Wider- \r\nreden, wodurch  der  Geist  in  der  Nähe  so  bedeutender \r\nGegenstände  lebhaftest  angeregt  und  gefördert  wird. \r\nUnsres  Hirts  Maxime  ruhte  auf  Ableitungen  griechischer \r\nund  römischer  Architektur  von  der  ältesten  notwendig- \r\nsten Holzkonstruktion,  worauf  er  denn  Lob  und  Tadel \r\nder  neuern  Ausführung  gründete  und  sich  dabei  der  Ge- \r\nschichte und  Beispiele  geschickt  zu  bedienen  wußte. \r\nAndere  behaupteten  dagegen,  daß  in  der  Baukunst,  wie \r\nin  jeder  andern,  geschmackvolle  Fiktionen  stattfänden, \r\nauf  welche  der  Baukünstler  niemals  Verzicht  tun  dürfe, \r\nindem  er  sich  in  den  mannigfaltigsten  Fällen,  die  ihm \r\nvorkommen,  bald  auf  diese,  bald  auf  jene  Weise  zu  hel- \r\nfen habe  und  von  der  strengen  Regel  abzuweichen  ge- \r\nnötigt sei. \r\nIn  Absicht  auf  Schönheit  geriet  er  auch  oft  mit  andern \r\n\r\n\r\n468  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nKünstlern  in  Diskrepanz,  indem  er  den  Grund  derselben \r\nins  Charakteristische  legte,  da  ihm  denn  insofern  die- \r\njenigen beipflichteten,  welche  sich  überzeugt  hielten,  daß \r\nfreilich  der  Charakter  jedem  Kunstwerk  zum  Grunde \r\nliegen  müsse,  die  Behandhmg  aber  dem  Schönheitssinne \r\nund  dem  Geschmack  anempfohlen  sei,  welche  einen  jeden \r\nCharakter  in  seiner  Angemessenheit  sowohl  als  in  seiner \r\nAnmut  darzustellen  haben. \r\n\r\nWeil  aber  die  Kunst  im  Tun  und  nicht  im  Reden  be- \r\nsteht, man  aber  dennoch  immerfort  mehr  reden  als  tun \r\nwird,  so  begreift  man  leicht,  daß  dergleichen  Unterhal- \r\ntungen damals  grenzenlos  waren,  wie  sie  es  bis  in  die \r\nneusten  Zeiten  geblieben  sind. \r\n\r\nWenn  die  differierenden  Meinungen  der  Künstler  zu  gar \r\nmancherlei  Unannehmlichkeiten,  ja  Entfernungen  unter- \r\neinander Gelegenheit  gaben,  so  traf  es  sich  auch  wohl, \r\nobgleich  selten,  daß  heitere  Vorfälle  sich  bei  solcher  Ge- \r\nlegenheit ereigneten.  Nachstehendes  mag  davon  ein  Bei- \r\nspiel sein. \r\n\r\nEine  Anzahl  Künstler  hatten  den  Nachmittag  im  Vatikan \r\nzugebracht  und  gingen  spät,  um  nicht  den  langen  ^Veg \r\ndurch  die  Stadt  zu  ihrem  Quartier  zu  nehmen,  zu  dem \r\nTor  an  der  Kolonnade  hinaus,  an  den  Weinbergen  her \r\nbis  an  die  Tiber.  Sie  hatten  sich  unterwegs  gestritten, \r\nkamen  streitend  ans  Ufer  und  setzten  auf  der  Überfahrt \r\ndie  Unterhaltung  lebhaft  fort.  Nun  wären  sie,  bei  Ripetta \r\naussteigend,  in  den  Fall  gekommen,  sich  zu  trennen  und \r\ndie  von  beiden  Seiten  noch  überflüssig  vorhandenen  Ar- \r\ngumente in  der  Geburt  erstickt  zu  sehen.  Sie  wurden \r\nalso  einig,  beisammenzubleiben  und  wieder  hinüber  und \r\nherüber  zu  fahren  und  auf  der  schwankenden  Fähre  ihrer \r\nDialektik  den  ferneren  Lauf  zu  lassen.  Einmal  aber  fand \r\nsich  diese  Bewegung  nicht  hinreichend;  sie  waren  einmal \r\nim  Zuge  und  verlangten  von  dem  Fährmann  mehrmalige \r\nWiederholung.  Dieser  auch  ließ  es  sich  wohl  gefallen, \r\nindem  ein  jedesmaliges  Herüber  und  Hinüber  ihm  von \r\nder  Person  einen  Bajocco  eintrug,  einen  ansehnlichen \r\nGewinn,  den  er  so  spät  nicht  mehr  zu  erwarten  hatte. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  469 \r\n\r\nDeshalb  erfüllte  er  ganz  stillschweigend  ihr  Verlangen; \r\nund  da  ihn  sein  Söhnchen  mit  Verwunderung  fragte:  Was \r\nwollen  sie  denn  damit?  antwortet'  er  ganz  ruhig:  Ich \r\nweiß  nicht,  aber  sie  sind  toll. \r\n\r\nUngefähr  in  dieser  Zeit  erhielt  ich  in  einem  Paket  von \r\nHause  nachstehenden  Brief: \r\n\r\nMonsieur,  je  ne  suis  pas  etonne  que  vous  ayez  de  niau- \r\nvais  lecteurs;  tant  de  gens  aiment  mieux  parier  que  sentir, \r\nmais  il  faut  les  plaindre  et  se  feliciter  de  ne  pas  leur \r\nressembler. — Oui,  Monsieur,  je  vous  dois  la  meilleure \r\naction  de  ma  vie,  par  consequent  la  racine  de  plusieurs \r\nautres,  et  pour  moi  votre  livre  est  bon.

Dezember. \r\nDiese  Woche  ist  mit  Zeichnen  zugebracht  worden,  da  es \r\nmit  der  Dichtung  nicht  fort  wollte;  man  muß  sehen  und \r\nsuchen,  alle  Epochen  zu  nutzen.  Unsre  Hausakademie \r\ngeht  immer  fort,  und  wir  sind  bemüht,  den  alten  x\\ngan- \r\ntyr  aus  dem  Schlafe  zu  wecken;  die  Perspektiv  beschäftigt \r\nuns  des  Abends,  und  ich  suche  immer  dabei  einige  Teile \r\ndes  menschlichen  Körpers  besser  und  sichrer  zeichnen \r\nzu  lernen.  Es  ist  nur  alles  Gründliche  gar  zu  schwer  und \r\nverlangt  große  Applikation  in  der  Ausübung. \r\nAngelica  ist  gar  lieb  und  gut,  sie  macht  mich  auf  alle \r\nWeise  zu  ihrem  Schuldner.  Den  Sonntag  bringen  wir  zu- \r\nsammen zu,  und  in  der  Woche  sehe  ich  sie  abends  ein- \r\nmal. Sie  arbeitet  so  viel  und  so  gut,  daß  man  gar  keinen \r\nBegrilif  hat,  wies  möglich  ist,  und  glaubt  doch  immer,  sie \r\nmache  nichts. \r\n\r\nDc7i  8.  Dezember. \r\nWie  sehr  es  mich  ergötzt,  daß  dir  mein  Liedchen  ge- \r\nfallen hat,  glaubst  du  nicht,  wie  sehr  es  mich  freut,  einen \r\nLaut  hervorzubringen,  der  in  deine  Stimmung  trifft.  Eben \r\ndas  wünscht  ich  Egmonten,  von  dem  du  so  wenig  sagst, \r\nund  eher,  daß  dir  daran  etwas  weh  als  wohl  tut.  O  wir \r\nwissen  genug,  daß  wir  eine  so  große  Komposition  schwer \r\nganz  rein  stimmen  können:  es  hat  doch  im  Grunde  nie- \r\nmand einen  rechten  Begriff  von  der  Schwierigkeit  der \r\nKunst  als  der  Künstler  selbst. \r\n\r\nEs  ist  weit  mehr  Positives^  das  heißt  Lehrbares  und  Über- \r\nlieferbares in  der  Kunst,  als  man  gewöhnlich  glaubt;  und \r\nder  mechanischen  Vorteile,  wodurch  man  die  geistigsten \r\nEffekte — versteht  sich,  immer  mit  Geist — hervorbringen \r\nkann,  sind  sehr  viele.  Wenn  man  diese  kleinen  Kunst- \r\ngriffe weiß,  ist  vieles  ein  Spiel,  was  nach  Wunder  was \r\naussieht,  und  nirgends  glaub  ich,  daß  man  mehr  lernen \r\nkann,  in  Hohem  und  Niedrem,  als  in  Rom. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  471 \r\n\r\nDen  75.  Dezember. \r\nIch  schreibe  dir  späte,  um  nur  etwas  zu  schreiben.  Diese \r\nWoche  hab  ich  sehr  vergnügt  zugebracht.  Es  wollte  die \r\nvorige  Woche  nicht  gehen,  weder  mit  einer  noch  andrer \r\nArbeit,  und  da  es  am  Montage  so  schön  Wetter  war  und \r\nmeine  Kenntnis  des  Himmels  mich  gute  Tage  hofien  ließ, \r\nmachte  ich  mich  mit  Kaysern  und  meinem  zweiten  Fritz \r\nauf  die  Beine  und  durchging  von  Dienstag  bis  heute \r\nabend  die  Plätze,  die  ich  schon  kannte,  und  verschie- \r\ndene Seiten,  die  ich  noch  nicht  kannte. \r\nDienstag  abend  erreichten  wir  Frascati,  Mittwoch  be- \r\nsuchten wir  die  schönsten  Villen  und  besonders  den  köst- \r\nlichen Antinous  auf  Monte  Dragone.  Donnerstag  gingen \r\nwir  von  Frascati  auf  Monte  Cavo  über  Rocca  di  Papa, \r\nwovon  du  einmal  Zeichnungen  haben  sollst,  denn  Worte \r\nund  Beschreibungen  sind  nichts;  dann  nach  Albano  her- \r\nunter. Freitag  schied  Kayser  von  uns,  dem  es  nicht  ganz \r\nwohl  war,  und  ich  ging  mit  Fritz  dem  Zweiten  auf  Aricia, \r\nGenzano,  am  See  von  Nemi  her  wieder  auf  Albano  zu- \r\nrück. Heute  sind  wir  auf  Castel  Gandolfo  und  Marino \r\ngegangen  und  von  da  nach  Rom  zurück.  Das  Wetter \r\nhat  uns  unglaublich  begünstigt,  es  war  fast  das  schönste \r\nWetter  des  ganzen  Jahrs.  Außer  den  immer  grünen \r\nBäumen  haben  noch  einige  Eichen  ihr  Laub,  auch  junge \r\nKastanien  noch  das  Laub,  wenn  gleich  gelb.  Es  sind \r\nTöne  in  der  Landschaft  von  der  größten  Schönheit,  und \r\ndie  herrlichen  großen  Formen  im  nächtlichen  Dunkel! \r\nIch  habe  große  Freude  gehabt,  die  ich  dir  in  der  Ferne \r\nmitteile.    Ich  war  sehr  vergnügt  und  wohl. \r\n\r\nDen  21.  Dezember. \r\nDaß  ich  zeichne  und  die  Kunst  studiere,  hilft  dem  Dich- \r\ntungsvermögen auf,  statt  es  zu  hindern;  denn  schreiben \r\nmuß  man  nur  wenig,  zeichnen  viel.  Dir  wünsche  ich  nur \r\nden  Begriff  der  bildenden  Kunst  mitteilen  zu  können, \r\nden  ich  jetzt  habe:  so  subordiniert  er  auch  noch  ist,  so \r\nerfreulich,  weil  er  wahr  ist  und  immer  weiter  deutet.  Der \r\nVerstand  und  die  Konsequenz  der  großen  Meister  ist \r\nunglaublich.  Wenn  ich  bei  meiner  Ankunft  in  Italien  wie \r\n\r\n\r\n472  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nneu  geboren  war,  so  fange  ich  jetzt  an,  wie  neu  erzogen \r\nzu  sein. \r\n\r\nWas  ich  bisher  geschickt  habe,  sind  nur  leichtsinnige \r\nVersuche.  Mit  Thurneisen  schicke  ich  eine  Rolle,  wor- \r\nauf das  Beste  fremde  Sachen  sind,  die  dich  erfreuen \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nDen  25.  Dezember. \r\nDiesmal  ist  Christus  unter  Donner  und  Blitzen  geboren \r\nworden,  wir  hatten  gerade  um  Mitternacht  ein  starkes \r\nWetter. \r\n\r\nDer  Glanz  der  größten  Kunstwerke  blendet  mich  nicht \r\nmehr;  ich  wandle  nun  im  Anschauen,  in  der  wahren  un- \r\nterscheidenden Erkenntnis.  Wieviel  ich  hierin  einem \r\nstillen  einsam  fleißigen  Schweizer,  namens  Meyer,  schul- \r\ndig bin,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen.  Er  hat  mir  zuerst  die \r\nAugen  über  das  Detail,  über  die  Eigenschaften  der  ein- \r\nzelnen Formen  aufgeschlossen,  hat  mich  in  das  eigent- \r\nliche Machen  initiiert.  Er  ist  in  wenigem  genügsam  und \r\nbescheiden.  Er  genießt  die  Kunstwerke  eigentlich  mehr \r\nals  die  großen  Besitzer,  die  sie  nicht  verstehen,  mehr  als \r\nandere  Künstler,  die  zu  ängstlich  von  der  Nachahmungs- \r\nbegierde des  Unerreichbaren  getrieben  werden.  Er  hat \r\neine  himmlische  Klarheit  der  Begriffe  und  eine  englische \r\nGüte  des  Herzens.  Er  spricht  niemals  mit  mir,  ohne  daß \r\nich  alles  aufschreiben  möchte,  w^as  er  sagt;  so  bestimmt, \r\nrichtig,  die  einzige  wahre  Linie  beschreibend  sind  seine \r\nWorte.  Sein  Unterricht  gibt  mir,  was  mir  kein  Mensch \r\ngeben  konnte,  und  seine  Entfernung  wird  mir  unersetz- \r\nlich bleiben.  In  seiner  Nähe,  in  einer  Reihe  von  Zeit, \r\nhoffe  ich  noch  auf  einen  Grad  im  Zeichnen  zu  kommen, \r\nden  ich  mir  jetzt  selbst  kaum  denken  darf.  Alles,  was \r\nich  in  Deutschland  lernte,  vornahm,  dachte,  verhält  sich \r\nzu  seiner  Leitung  wie  Baumrinde  zum  Kern  der  Frucht. \r\nIch  habe  keine  Worte,  die  stille  wache  Seligkeit  auszu- \r\ndrücken, mit  der  ich  nun  die  Kunstwerke  zu  betrachten \r\nanfange;  mein  Geist  ist  erweitert  genug,  um  sie  zu  fassen, \r\nund  bildet  sich  immer  mehr  aus,  um  sie  eigentlich  schätzen \r\nzu  können. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  473 \r\n\r\nEs  sind  wieder  Fremde  hier,  mit  denen  ich  manchmal \r\neine  Galerie  sehe;  sie  kommen  mir  wie  Wespen  in  mei- \r\nnem Zimmer  vor,  die  gegen  die  Fenster  fahren  und  die \r\nhelle  Scheibe  für  Luft  halten,  dann  wieder  abprallen  und \r\nan  den  Wänden  summen. \r\n\r\nIn  den  schweigenden  zurücktretenden  Zustand  mag  ich \r\neinen  Feind  nicht  wünschen.  Und  wie  sonst  für  \"krank\" \r\nund  \"borniert\"'  gehalten  zu  werden,  geziemt  mir  weniger \r\nals  jemals.  Denke  also,  mein  Lieber,  tue,  wirke  das  Beste \r\nfür  mich  und  erhalte  mir  mein  Leben,  das  sonst,  ohne \r\njemanden  zu  nutzen,  zugrunde  geht.  Ja  ich  muß  sagen: \r\nich  bin  dieses  Jahr  moralisch  sehr  verwöhnt  worden. \r\nGanz  abgeschnitten  von  aller  Welt,  hab  ich  eine  Zeitlang \r\nallein  gestanden.  Nun  hat  sich  wieder  ein  enger  Kreis \r\num  mich  gezogen,  die  alle  gut  sind,  alle  auf  dem  rechten \r\nWege,  und  das  ist  nur  das  Kennzeichen,  daß  sie  es  bei \r\nmir  aushalten  können,  mich  mögen,  Freude  in  meiner \r\nGegenwart  finden,  je  mehr  sie  denkend  und  handelnd \r\nauf  dem  rechten  Wege  sind.  Denn  ich  bin  unbarmherzig, \r\nunduldsam  gegen  alle,  die  auf  ihrem  Wege  schlendern \r\noder  irren  und  doch  für  Boten  und  Reisende  gehalten \r\nwerden  wollen.  Mit  Scherz  und  Spott  treib  ichs  so  lang, \r\nbis  sie  ihr  Leben  ändern  oder  sich  von  mir  scheiden. \r\nHier,  versteht  sich,  ist  nur  von  guten,  graden  Menschen \r\ndie  Rede;  Halb-  und  Schiefköpfe  werden  gleich  oline \r\nUmstände  mit  der  Wanne  gesondert.  Zwei  Menschen \r\ndanken  mir  schon  ihre  Sinnes-  und  Lebensänderung,  ja \r\ndreie,  und  werden  sie  mir  zeitlebens  danken.  Da,  auf \r\ndem  Punkte  der  Wirkung  meines  Wesens,  fühl  ich  die \r\nGesundheit  meiner  Natur  und  ihre  Ausbreitung;  meine \r\nFüße  werden  nur  krank  in  engen  Schuhen,  und  ich  sehe \r\nnichts,  wenn  man  mich  vor  eine  Mauer  stellt. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nDezember \r\n\r\nDer  Monat  Dezember  war  mit  heiterem,  ziemlich  gleichem \r\nWetter  eingetreten,  wodurch  ein  Gedanke  rege  ward,  der \r\neiner  guten   frohen   Gesellschaft  viel  angenehme  Tage \r\n\r\n\r\n474  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nverschaffen  sollte.  Man  sagte  nämlich:  Stellen  wir  uns \r\nvor,  wir  kamen  soeben  in  Rom  an  und  müßten  als  eilige \r\nFremde  geschwind  von  den  vorzüglichsten  Gegenständen \r\nuns  unterrichten.  Beginnen  wir  einen  Umgang  in  diesem \r\nSinne,  damit  das  schon  Bekannte  möchte  in  Geist  und \r\nSinn  wieder  neu  werden. \r\n\r\nDie  Ausführung  des  Gedankens  ward  alsobald  begonnen \r\nund  mit  einiger  Stetigkeit  so  ziemlich  durchgesetzt;  lei- \r\nder, daß  von  manchem  Guten,  welches  bei  dieser  Ge- \r\nlegenheit bemerkt  und  gedacht  worden,  nur  wenig  übrig \r\ngeblieben.  Briefe,  Notizen,  Zeichnungen  und  Entwürfe \r\nmangeln  von  dieser  Epoche  fast  gänzlich;  einiges  werde \r\njedoch  hievon  kürzlich  mitgeteilt. \r\n\r\nUnterhalb  Roms,  eine  Strecke  nicht  weit  von  der  Tiber, \r\nliegt  eine  mäßig  große  Kirche,  zu  den  drei  Brünnlein  ge- \r\nnannt: diese  sind,  so  erzählt  man,  bei  Enthauptung  des \r\nheiligen  Paulus  durch  sein  Blut  hervorgerufen  worden \r\nund  quillen  noch  bis  auf  den  heutigen  Tag. \r\nOhnehin  ist  die  Kirche  niedrig  gelegen,  und  da  ver- \r\nmehren denn  freilich  die  in  ihrem  Innern  hervordringen- \r\nden Röhrbrunnen  eine  dunstige  Feuchtigkeit.  Das  Innere \r\nsteht  wenig  geschmückt  und  beinahe  verlassen,  nur  für \r\neinen  seltenen  Gottesdienst,  reinlich,  wenn  gleich  mo- \r\nderhaft, gehegt  und  besorgt.  Was  ihr  aber  ziu:  größten \r\nZierde  dient,  sind  Christus  und  seine  Apostel,  die  Reihe \r\nher  an  den  Pfeilern  des  Schiffs,  nach  Zeichnungen  Raf- \r\nfaels  farbig  in  Lebensgröße  gemalt.  Dieser  außerordent- \r\nliche Geist  hat  jene  frommen  Männer,  die  er  sonst  am \r\nrechten  Orte  in  versammelter  Schar  als  übereinstimmend \r\ngekleidet  vorgeführt,  hier,  da  jeder  einzelne  abgesondert \r\nauftritt,  jeden  auch  mit  besonderer  Auszeichnung  abge- \r\nbildet, nicht  als  wenn  er  im  Gefolge  des  Herrn  sich  be- \r\nfände, sondern  als  wenn  er,  nach  der  Heimfahrt  des- \r\nselben auf  seine  eignen  Füße  gestellt,  nunmelir  seinem \r\nCharakter  gemäß  das  Leben  durchzuwirken  und  auszu- \r\ndulden  habe. \r\n\r\nUm  uns  aber  von  den  Vorzügen  dieser  Bilder  auch  in \r\nder  Ferne  zu  belehren,  sind  uns  Nachbildungen  der \r\nOriginalzeichnungen  von  der  treuen  Hand  Marc  Antons \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  475 \r\n\r\nübrig  geblieben,  welche  uns  öfters  Gelegenheit  und  An- \r\nlaß gaben,  unser  Gedächtnis  aufzufrischen  und  unsere \r\nBemerkungen  niederzuschreiben.  Wir  fügen  den  Auszug \r\neines  Aufsatzes  bei,  der  in  dem  Jahre  1789  in  den  Deut- \r\nschen Merkur  aufgenommen  worden. \r\nDie  Aufgabe,  einen  verkLärten  Lehrer  mit  seinen  zwölf \r\nersten  und  vornehmsten  Schülern,  welche  ganz  an  seinen \r\nWorten  und  an  seinem  Dasein  hingen  und  größtenteils \r\nihren  einfachen  Wandel  mit  einem  Märtyrertode  krönten, \r\ngebührend  vorzustellen,  hat  er  mit  einer  solchen  Einfalt, \r\nMannigfaltigkeit,  Herzlichkeit  und  mit  so  einem  reichen \r\nKunstverständnis  gelöst,  daß  wir  diese  Blätter  für  eins  der \r\nschönsten  Monumente  seines  glücklichen  Daseins  halten \r\nkönnen. \r\n\r\nWas  uns  von  ihrem  Charakter,  Stande,  Beschäftigung, \r\n^Vandel  und  Tode  in  Schriften  oder  durch  Traditionen \r\nübrig  geblieben,  hat  er  auf  das  zarteste  benutzt  und  da- \r\ndurch eine  Reihe  von  Gestalten  hervorgebracht,  welche, \r\nohne  einander  zu  gleichen,  eine  innere  Beziehung  auf- \r\neinander haben.  Wir  wollen  sie  einzeln  durchgehen,  um \r\nunsre  Leser  auf  die  interessante  Sammlung  aufmerksam \r\nzu  machen. \r\n\r\nPetrus.  Er  hat  ihn  gerad  von  vorne  gestellt  und  ihm  eine \r\nfeste  gedrungene  Gestalt  gegeben.  Die  Extremitäten  sind \r\nbei  dieser,  wie  bei  einigen  andern  Figuren,  ein  wenig  groß \r\ngehalten,  wodurch  die  Figur  etwas  kürzer  scheint.  Der \r\nHals  ist  kurz,  und  die  kurzen  Haare  sind  unter  allen  drei- \r\nzehn Figuren  am  stärksten  gekraust.  Die  Hauptfalten  des \r\nGewandes  laufen  in  der  Mitte  des  Körpers  zusammen,  das \r\nGesicht  sieht  man,  wie  die  übrige  Gestalt,  ganz  von  vorn. \r\nDie  Figur  ist  in  sich  fest  zusammengenommen  und  steht \r\nda  wie  ein  Pfeiler,  der  eine  Last  zu  tragen  imstande  ist. \r\nPaulus  ist  auch  stehend  abgebildet,  aber  abgewendet,  wie \r\neiner  der  gehen  will  und  nochmals  zurücksieht;  der  Mantel \r\nist  aufgezogen  und  über  den  Arm,  in  welchem  er  das  Buch \r\nhält,  geschlagen;  die  Füße  sind  frei,  es  hindert  sie  nichts \r\nam  Fortschreiten;  Haare  und  Bart  bewegen  sich  wie  Flam- \r\nmen, und  ein  schwärmerischer  Geist  glüht  auf  dem  Ge- \r\nsichte. \r\n\r\n\r\n476  ITAIJENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nJohaftties.  Ein  edler  Jüngling,  mit  langen,  angenehmen, \r\nnur  am  Ende  krausen  Haaren.  Er  scheint  zufrieden,  ruhig, \r\ndie  Zeugnisse  der  Religion,  das  Buch  und  den  Kelch,  zu \r\nbesitzen  und  vorzuzeigen.  Es  ist  ein  sehr  glücklicher  Kunst- \r\ngriff\", daß  der  Adler,  indem  er  die  Flügel  hebt,  das  Gewand \r\nsogleich  mit  in  die  Höhe  nimmt,  und  durch  dieses  Mittel \r\ndie  schön  angelegten  Falten  in  die  vollkommenste  Lage \r\ngesetzt  werden. \r\n\r\nMatthäus.  Ein  wohlhabender,  behaglicher,  auf  seinem \r\nDasein  beruhender  Mann.  Die  allzu  große  Ruhe  und  Be- \r\nquemlichkeit ist  durch  einen  ernsthaften,  beinahe  scheuen \r\nBlick  ins  Gleichgewicht  gebracht;  die  Falten,  die  über  den \r\nLeib  geschlagen  sind,  und  der  Geldbeutel  geben  einen \r\nunbeschreiblichen  Begrift'  von  behaglicher  Harmonie. \r\nThomas  ist  eine  der  schönsten,  in  der  größten  Einfalt  aus- \r\ndruckvollsten Figuren.  Er  steht  in  seinen  Mantel  zusam- \r\nmengenommen, der  auf  beiden  Seiten  fast  symmetrische \r\nFalten  wirft,  die  aber  durch  ganz  leise  Veränderungen  ein- \r\nander völlig  unähnlich  gemacht  worden  sind.  Stiller,  ruhi- \r\nger, bescheidner  kann  wohl  kaum  eine  Gestalt  gebildet \r\nwerden.  Die  Wendung  des  Kopfes,  der  Ernst,  der  beinahe \r\ntraurige  Blick,  die  Feinheit  des  Mundes  harmonieren  auf \r\ndas  schönste  mit  dem  ruhigen  Ganzen.  Die  Haare  allein \r\nsind  in  Bewegung,  ein  unter  einer  sanften  Außenseite  be- \r\nwegtes Gemüt  anzuzeigen. \r\n\r\nJakobus  major.  Eine  sanfte,  eingehüllte,  vorbeiwandelnde \r\nPilgrimsgestalt. \r\n\r\nPhilippus.  Man  lege  diesen  zwischen  die  beiden  vorher- \r\ngehenden und  betrachte  den  Faltenwurf  aller  drei  neben- \r\neinander, und  es  wird  auffallen,  wie  reich,  groß,  breit  die \r\nFalten  dieser  Gestalt  gegen  jene  gehalten  sind.  So  reich \r\nund  vornehm  sein  Gewand  ist,  so  sicher  steht  er,  so  fest \r\nhält  er  das  Kreuz,  so  scharf  sieht  er  darauf,  und  das  Ganze \r\nscheint  eine  innere  Größe,  Ruhe  und  Festigkeit  anzu- \r\ndeuten. \r\n\r\nAndreas  umarmt  und  liebkoset  sein  Kreuz  mehr,  als  er  es \r\nträgt;  die  einfachen  Falten  des  Mantels  sind  mit  großem \r\nVerstände  geworfen. \r\nTaddäus.    Ein  Jüngling,  der,  wie  es  die  Mönche  auf  der \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  477 \r\n\r\nReise  zu  tun  pflegen,  sein  langes  Überkleid  in  die  Höhe \r\nnimmt,  daß  es  ihn  nicht  im  Gehen  hindere.  Aus  dieser \r\neinfachen  Handlung  entstehen  sehr  schöne  Falten.  Er \r\nträgt  die  Partisane,  das  Zeichen  seines  Märtyrertodes,  als \r\neinen  Wanderstab  in  der  Hand. \r\n\r\nMatthias.  Ein  munterer  Alter,  in  einem  durch  höchst  ver- \r\nstandene Falten  vermannigfaltigten  einfachen  Kleide,  lehnt \r\nsich  auf  einen  Spieß,  sein  Mantel  fällt  hinterwärts  her- \r\nunter. \r\n\r\nSivion.  Die  Falten  des  Mantels  sowohl  als  des  übrigen \r\nGewandes,  womit  diese  mehr  von  hinten  als  von  der  Seite \r\nzu  sehende  Figur  bekleidet  ist,  gehören  mit  unter  die \r\nschönsten  der  ganzen  Sammlung,  wie  überhaupt  in  der \r\nStellung,  in  der  Miene,  in  dem  Haarwuchse  eine  unbe- \r\nschreibliche Harmonie  zu  bewundem  ist. \r\nBartholomäus  steht  in  seinen  Mantel  wild  und  mit  großer \r\nKunst  kunstlos  eingewickelt;  seine  Stellung,  seine  Haare, \r\ndie  Art,  wie  er  das  Messer  hält,  möchte  uns  fast  auf  die \r\nGedanken  bringen,  er  sei  eher  bereit,  jemanden  die  Haut \r\nabzuziehen,  als  eine  solche  Operation  zu  dulden. \r\nChristus  zuletzt  wird  wohl  niemanden  befriedigen,  der  die \r\nWundergestalt  eines  Gottmenschen  hier  suchen  möchte. \r\nEr  tritt  einfach  und  still  hervor,  um  das  Volk  zu  segnen. \r\nVon  dem  Gewand,  das  von  unten  heraufgezogen  ist,  in \r\nschönen  Falten  das  Knie  sehen  läßt  und  wider  dem  Leibe \r\nruht,  wird  man  mit  Recht  behaupten,  daß  es  sich  keinen \r\nAugenblick  so  erhalten  könne,  sondern  gleich  herunter- \r\nfallen müsse.  Wahrscheinlich  hat  Rafiael  supponiert,  die \r\nFigur  habe  mit  der  rechten  Hand  das  Gewand  heraufge- \r\nzogen und  angehalten  und  lasse  es  in  dem  Augenblicke, \r\nindem  sie  den  Arm  zum  Segnen  aufhebt,  los,  so  daß  es \r\neben  niederfallen  muß.  Es  wäre  dieses  ein  Beispiel  von \r\ndem  schönen  Kunstmittel,  die  kurz  vorhergegangene \r\nHandlung  durch  den  überbleibenden  Zustand  der  Falten \r\nanzudeuten. \r\n\r\nVon  diesem  kleinen  bescheidenen  Kirchlein  ist  jedoch \r\nnicht  weit  zu  dem  größeren,  dem  hohen  Apostel  gewid- \r\nmeten  Denkmal:    es   ist   die   Kirche  St.  Paul   vor   den \r\n\r\n\r\n478  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nMauern  genannt,  ein  aus  alten  herrlichen  Resten  groß \r\nund  kunstreich  zusammengestelltes  Monument.  Der  Ein- \r\ntritt in  diese  Kirche  verleiht  einen  erhabenen  Eindruck: \r\ndie  mächtigsten  Säulenreihen  tragen  hohe  gemalte  Wände, \r\nwelche,  oben  durch  das  verschränkte  Zimmerwerk  des \r\nDachs  geschlossen,  zwar  jetzt  unsemi  verwöhnten  Auge \r\neinen  scheunenartigen  Anbhck  geben,  obschon  das  Ganze, \r\nwäre  die  Kontignation  an  festlichen  Tagen  mit  Teppi- \r\nchen überspannt,  von  unglaublicher  Wirkung  sein  müßte. \r\nMancher  wundersame  Rest  kolossaler,  höchst  verzierter \r\nArchitektur  an  Kapitalen  findet  sich  hier  anständig  auf- \r\nbewahrt, aus  den  Ruinen  von  dem  ehmals  nahe  gelege- \r\nnen, jetzo  fast  ganz  verschwundenen  Palast  des  Caracalla \r\nentnommen  und  gerettet. \r\n\r\nDie  Rennbahn  sodann,  die  von  diesem  Kaiser  noch  jetzt \r\nden  Namen  führt,  gibt  uns,  wenn  schon  großenteils  ver- \r\nfallen, doch  noch  einen  Begrift'  eines  solchen  immensen \r\nRaumes.  Stellte  sich  der  Zeichner  an  den  linken  Flügel \r\nder  zum  Wettlauf  Ausfahrenden,  so  hätte  er  rechts  in  der \r\nHöhe,  über  den  zertrümmerten  Sitzen  der  Zuschauer, \r\ndas  Grab  der  Cäcilia  Metella  mit  dessen  neueren  Um- \r\ngebungen, von  wo  aus  die  Linie  der  ehemaligen  Sitze \r\nins  Grenzenlose  hinausläuft  und  in  der  Ferne  bedeutende \r\nVillen  und  Lusthäuser  sich  sehen  lassen.  Kehrt  das  Auge \r\nzurück,  so  kann  es  gerade  vor  sich  die  Ruinen  der  Spina \r\nnoch  gar  wohl  verfolgen,  und  derjenige,  dem  architek- \r\ntonische Phantasie  gegeben  ist,  kann  sich  den  Übermut \r\njener  Tage  einigermaßen  vergegenwärtigen.  Der  Gegen- \r\nstand in  Trümmern,  wie  er  jetzt  vor  unsern  Augen  Hegt, \r\nwürde  auf  jeden  Fall,  wenn  ein  geistreicher  und  kennt- \r\nnisgewandter Künstler  es  unternehmen  wollte,  immer \r\nnoch  ein  angenehmes  Bild  geben,  das  freilich  um  das \r\nDoppelte  länger  als  hoch  sein  müßte. \r\nDie  Pyramide  des  Cestius  ward  für  diesmal  mit  den \r\nAugen  von  außen  begrüßt  und  die  Trümmer  der  Antoni- \r\nni.schen  oder  Caracallischen  Bäder^  von  denen  uns  Pira- \r\nnesi  so  manches  Eftektreiche  vorgefabelt,  konnten  auch \r\ndem  malerisch  gewöhnten  Auge  in  der  Gegenwart  kaum \r\neinige  Zufriedenheit  geben.    Doch  sollte  bei  dieser  Ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  479 \r\n\r\nlegenheit  die  Erinnerung  an  Hermann  van  Svanevelt \r\nlebendig  werden,  welcher  mit  seiner  zarten,  das  reinste \r\nNatur-  und  Kunstgefühl  ausdrückenden  Nadel  diese  Ver- \r\ngangenheiten zu  beleben,  ja  sie  zu  den  anmutigsten  Trä- \r\ngern des  lebendig  Gegenwärtigen  umzuschauen  wußte. \r\nAuf  dem  Platze  vor  St.  Peter  in  Montorio  begiüßten  wir \r\nden  Wasserschwall  der  Acqua  Paola,  welcher  durch  eines \r\nTriumphbogens  Pforten  und  Tore  in  fünf  Strömen  ein \r\ngroßes  verhältnismäßiges  Becken  bis  an  den  Rand  füllt. \r\nDurch  einen  von  Paul  V.  wiederhergestellten  Aquädukt \r\nmacht  diese  Stromfülle  einen  Weg  von  fünfunddreißig \r\nMigiien  hinter  dem  See  Bracciano  her  durch  ein  wun- \r\nderliches, von  abwechselnden  Höhen  gebotenes  Zick- \r\nzack bis  an  diesen  Ort,  versieht  die  Bedürfnisse  ver- \r\nschiedener Mühlen  und  Fabriken,  um  sich  zugleich  in \r\nTrastevere  zu  verbreiten. \r\n\r\nHier  nun  rühmten  Freunde  der  Baukunst  den  glücklichen \r\nGedanken,  diesen  Wassern  einen  offen  schaubaren  trium- \r\nphierenden Eintritt  verschafft  zu  haben.  Man  wird  durch \r\nSäulen  und  Bogen,  durch  Gesims  und  Attiken  an  jene \r\nPrachttore  erinnert,  wodurch  ehmals  kriegerische  Über- \r\nwinder einzutreten  pflegten;  hier  tritt  der  friedlichste  Er- \r\nnährer mit  gleicher  Kraft  und  Gewalt  ein  und  empfängt \r\nfür  die  Mühen  seines  weiten  Laufes  sogleich  Dank  und \r\nBewunderung.  Auch  sagen  uns  die  Inschriften,  daß  Vor- \r\nsehung und  Wohltätigkeit  eines  Papstes  aus  dem  Hause \r\nBorghese  hier  gleichsam  einen  ewigen,  ununterbrochenen \r\nstattlichen  Einzug  halten. \r\n\r\nEin  kurz  vorher  eingetroffener  Ankömmling  aus  Norden \r\nfand  jedoch,  man  würde  besser  getan  haben,  rohe  Felsen \r\nhier  aufzutürmen,  um  diesen  Fluten  einen  natürlicheren \r\nEintritt  ans  Tageslicht  zu  verschaffen.  Man  entgegnete \r\nihm,  daß  dies  kein  Natur-,  sondern  ein  Kunstwasser  sei, \r\ndessen  Ankunft  man  auf  eine  gleichartige  Weise  zu \r\nschmücken  gar  wohl  berechtigt  gewesen  wäre. \r\nDoch  hierüber  vereinigte  man  sich  ebensowenig  als  über \r\ndas  herrliche  Bild  der  Transfiguration,  welches  man  in \r\ndem  zunächst  gelegenen  Kloster  gleich  darauf  anzu- \r\nstaunen Gelegenheit  fand.    Da  war  denn  des  Redens  viel; \r\n\r\n\r\n48o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nder  stillere  Teil  jedoch  iirgerte  sich,  den  alten  Tadel \r\nvon  doppelter  Handlung  wiederholt  zu  sehen.  Es  ist  aber \r\nnicht  anders  in  der  Welt,  als  daß  eine  wertlose  Münze \r\nneben  einer  gehaltigen  auch  immer  eine  gewisse  Art  von \r\nKurs  behält,  besonders  da,  wo  man  in  der  Kürze  aus \r\neinem  Handel  zu  scheiden  und  ohne  viel  Überlegung \r\nund  Zaudern  gewisse  Difterenzen  auszugleichen  gedenkt. \r\nWundersam  bleibt  es  indes  immer,  daß  man  an  der \r\ngroßen  Einheit  einer  solchen  Konzeption  jemals  hat \r\nmäkeln  dürfen.  In  Abwesenheit  des  Herren  stellen  trost- \r\nlose Eltern  einen  besessenen  Knaben  den  Jüngern  des \r\nHeiligen  dar;  sie  mögen  schon  Versuche  gemacht  haben, \r\nden  Geist  zu  bannen;  man  hat  sogar  ein  Buch  aufge- \r\nschlagen, um  zu  forschen,  ob  nicht  etwa  eine  überlieferte \r\nFormel  gegen  dieses  Übel  wirksam  könne  gefunden  wer- \r\nden, aber  vergebens.  In  diesem  Augenblick  erscheint \r\nder  einzig  Kräftige,  und  zwar  verklärt,  anerkannt  von \r\nseinen  großen  Vorfahren;  eilig  deutet  man  hinauf  nach \r\nsolcher  Vision,  als  der  einzigen  Quelle  des  Heils.  Wie \r\nwill  man  nun  das  Obere  und  Untere  trennen?  Beides  ist \r\neins:  unten  das  Leidende,  Bedürftige,  oben  das  Wirk- \r\nsame, Hülfreiche,  beides  aufeinander  sich  beziehend,  in- \r\neinander einwirkend.  Läßt  sich  denn,  um  den  Sinn  auf \r\neine  andere  Weise  auszusprechen,  ein  ideeller  Bezug  aufs \r\nWirkliche  von  diesem  lostrennen? \r\n\r\nDie  Gleichgesinnten  bestärkten  sich  auch  diesmal  in  ihrer \r\nÜberzeugung.  Raffael,  sagten  sie  zueinander,  zeichnete \r\nsich  eben  durch  die  Richtigkeit  des  Denkens  aus,  und  der \r\ngottbegabte  Mann,  den  man  eben  hieran  durchaus  er- \r\nkennt, soll  in  der  Blüte  seines  Lebens  falsch  gedacht, \r\nfalsch  gehandelt  haben?  Nein!  er  hat,  wie  die  Natur, \r\njederzeit  recht,  und  gerade  da  am  gründlichsten,  wo  wir \r\nsie  am  wenigsten  begreifen. \r\n\r\nEine  Verabredung  wie  die  unsrige,  einen  Hüchtigen  Über- \r\nblick von  Rom  sich  in  guter  vereinigter  Gesellschaft  zu \r\nverschafien,  konnte  nicht  ganz,  wie  es  wohl  der  Vorsatz \r\ngewesen,  in  völliger  Abgesondertheit  durchgeführt  werden; \r\nein  und  der  andere  felilte,  vielleicht  zufällig  abgehalten, \r\nwieder  andere  schlössen  sich  an,  auf  ihrem  Wege  dieses \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  481 \r\n\r\noder  jenes  Sehenswürdige  zu  betrachten.  Dabei  hielt \r\njedoch  der  Kern  zusammen  und  wußte  bald  aufzunehmen, \r\nbald  abzusondern,  bald  zurückzubleiben,  bald  vorzueilen. \r\nGelegentlich  hatte  man  freilich  gar  wunderliche  Äuße- \r\nrungen zu  vernehmen.  Es  gibt  eine  gewisse  Art  von  em- \r\npirischem Urteil,  welches  seit  längerer  Zeit,  zumal  durch \r\nenglische  und  französische  Reisende,  besonders  in  den \r\nGang  gekommen:  man  spricht  sein  augenblickliches  unvor- \r\nbereitetes Urteil  aus,  ohne  nur  irgend  zu  bedenken,  daß \r\njeder  Künstler  auf  gar  vielfache  Weise  bedingt  ist,  durch \r\nsein  besonderes  Talent,  durch  Vorgänger  und  Meister, \r\ndurch  Ort  und  Zeit,  durch  Gönner  und  Besteller.  Nichts \r\nvon  allem  dem,  welches  freilich  zu  einer  reinen  Würde- \r\nrung  nötig  wäre,  kommt  in  Betrachtung,  und  so  entsteht \r\ndaraus  ein  gräßliches  Gemisch  von  Lob  und  Tadel,  von \r\nBejahen  und  Verneinen,  wodurch  jeder  eigentümliche  Wert \r\nder  fraglichen  Gegenstände  ganz  eigentlich  aufgehoben \r\nwird. \r\n\r\nUnser  guter  Volkmann,  sonst  so  aufmerksam  und  als  Führer \r\nnützlich  genug,  scheint  sich  durchaus  an  jene  fremden  Ur- \r\nteiler  gehalten  zu  haben,  deswegen  denn  seine  eigenen \r\nSchätzungen  gar  wunderlich  hervortreten.  Kann  man  sich \r\nzum  Beispiel  unglücklicher  ausdrücken,  als  er  sich  in  der \r\nKirche  Maria  della  Face  vernehmen  läßt? \r\n\"Über  der  ersten  Kapelle  hat  Raffael  einige  Sibyllen  ge- \r\nmalt, die  sehr  gelitten  haben.  Die  Zeichnung  ist  richtig, \r\naber  die  Zusammensetzung  schwach,  welches  vermutlich \r\ndem  unbequemen  Platz  beigemessen  werden  muß.  Die \r\nzwote  Kapelle  ist  nach  des  Michael  Angelo  Zeichnungen \r\nmit  Arabesken  geziert,  die  hoch  geschätzt  werden,  aber \r\nnicht  simpel  genug  sind.  Unter  der  Kuppel  bemerkt  man \r\ndrei  Gemälde:  das  erste  stellt  die  Heimsuchung  der  Maria \r\nvon  Karl  Maratti  vor,  ist  frostig  gemalt,  aber  gut  ange- \r\nordnet; das  andere  die  Geburt  der  Maria  vom  Kavalier \r\nVanni,  in  der  Manier  des  Peter  von  Cortona,  und  das \r\ndritte  den  Tod  der  Maria  von  Maria  Morandi.  Die  An- \r\nordnung ist  etwas  verwirrt  und  fällt  ins  Rohe.  Am  Ge- \r\nwölbe über  dem  Chor  hat  Albani  mit  einem  schwachen \r\nKolorit  die  Himmelfahrt  der  Maria  abgebildet.    Die  von \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  31 \r\n\r\n\r\n482  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nihm  herrührenden  Malereien  an  den  Pfeilern  unter  der \r\nKuppel  sind  besser  geraten.  Den  Hof  des  zu  dieser  Kirche \r\ngehörigen  Klosters  hat  Bramante  angegeben.\" \r\nDergleichen  unzulängliche,  schwankende  Urteile  verwirren \r\ndurchaus  den  Beschauer,  der  ein  solches  Buch  zum  Leit- \r\nfaden erwählt.  Manches  ist  denn  aber  auch  ganz  falsch, \r\nzum  Beispiel  was  hier  von  den  Sibyllen  gesagt  ist.  Rafiael \r\nwar  niemals  von  dem  Räume  geniert,  den  ihm  die  Archi- \r\ntektur darbot,  vielmehr  gehört  zu  der  Großheit  und  Ele- \r\nganz seines  Genies,  daß  er  jeden  Raum  auf  das  zierlichste \r\nzu  füllen  und  zu  schmücken  wußte,  wie  er  augenfällig  in \r\nder  Farnesine  dargetan  hat.  Selbst  die  herrlichen  Bilder \r\nder  Messe  von  Bolsena,  der  Befreiung  des  gefangenen \r\nPetrus,  des  Parnasses  wären  ohne  die  wunderliche  Be- \r\nschränkung des  Raumes  nicht  so  unschätzbar  geistreich \r\nzu  denken.  Ebenso  ist  auch  hier  in  den  Sibyllen  die  ver- \r\nheimlichte Symmetrie,  worauf  bei  der  Komposition  alles \r\nankommt,  auf  eine  höchst  geniale  Weise  obwaltend;  denn \r\nwie  in  dem  Organismus  der  Natur,  so  tut  sich  auch  in  der \r\nKunst  innerhalb  der  genausten  Schranke  die  Vollkom- \r\nmenheit der  Lebensäußerung  kund. \r\n\r\nWie  dem  aber  auch  sei,  so  mag  einem  jeden  die  Art \r\nund  Weise,  Kunstwerke  aufzunehmen,  völlig  überlassen \r\nbleiben.  Mir  ward  bei  diesem  Umgang  das  Gefühl,  der \r\nBegriff,  die  Anschauung  dessen,  was  man  im  höchsten \r\nSiiane  die  Gegenwart  des  klassischen  Bodens  nennen \r\ndürfte.  Ich  nenne  dies  die  sinnlich  geistige  Überzeugung, \r\ndaß  hier  das  Große  war,  ist  und  sein  wird.  Daß  das \r\nGrößte  und  Herrlichste  vergehe,  liegt  in  der  Natur  der \r\nZeit  und  der  gegeneinander  unbedingt  wirkenden  sitt- \r\nlichen und  physischen  Elemente.  Wir  konnten  in  allge- \r\nmeinster Betrachtung  nicht  traurig  an  dem  Zerstörten \r\nvorübergehen,  vielmehr  hatten  wir  uns  zu  freuen,  daß \r\nso  viel  erhalten,  so  viel  wiederhergestellt  war,  prächtiger \r\nund  übermäßiger,  als  es  je  gestanden. \r\nDie  Peterskirche  ist  gewiß  so  groß  gedacht,  und  wohl \r\ngrößer  und  kühner  als  einer  der  alten  Tempel,  und  nicht \r\nallein,  was  zweitausend  Jahre  vernichten  sollten,  lag  vor \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  483 \r\n\r\nunsern  Augen,  sondern  zugleich,  was  eine  gesteigerte \r\nBildung  wieder  hervorzubringen  vermochte. \r\nSelbst  das  Schwanken  des  Kunstgeschmackes,  das  Be- \r\nstreben zum  einfachen  Großen,  das  Wiederkehren  zum \r\nvervielfachten  Kleineren,  alles  deutete  auf  Leben  und \r\nBewegung;  Kunst-  und  Menschengeschichte  standen  syn- \r\nchronistisch vor  unseren  Augen. \r\n\r\nEs  darf  uns  nicht  niederschlagen,  wenn  sich  uns  die  Be- \r\nmerkung aufdringt,  das  Große  sei  vergänglich;  vielmehr \r\nwenn  wir  finden,  das  Vergangene  sei  groß  gewesen,  muß \r\nes  uns  aufmuntern,  selbst  etwas  von  Bedeutung  zu  leisten, \r\ndas  fortan  unsre  Nachfolger,  und  war  es  auch  schon  in \r\nTrümmer  zerfallen,  zu  edler  Tätigkeit  aufrege,  woran  es \r\nunsre  Vorvordern  niemals  haben  ermangeln  lassen. \r\n\r\nDiese  höchst  belehrenden  und  geisterhebenden  Anschau- \r\nimgen  wurden^  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  gestört  und  unter- \r\nbrochen, aber  doch  mit  einem  schmerzlichen  Gefühl \r\ndurchflochten,  das  mich  überallhin  begleitete;  ich  erfuhr \r\nnämlich,  daß  der  Bräutigam  jener  artigen  Mailänderin, \r\nunter  ich  weiß  nicht  welchem  Vorwande,  sein  Wort  zu- \r\nrückgenommen und  sich  von  seiner  Versprochenen  los- \r\ngesagt habe.  Wenn  ich  mich  nun  einerseits  glücklich \r\npries,  meiner  Neigung  nicht  nachgehangen  und  mich  sehr \r\nbald  von  dem  lieben  Kinde  zurückgezogen  zu  haben,  wie \r\ndenn  auch  nach  genauster  Erkundigimg  unter  den  Vor- \r\nwänden jener  Villeggiatur  auch  nicht  im  mindesten  gedacht \r\nworden,  so  war  es  mir  doch  höchst  empfindlich,  das  artige \r\nBild,  das  mich  bisher  so  heiter  und  freundUch  begleitet \r\nhatte,  nunmehr  getrübt  und  entstellt  zu  sehen:  denn  ich \r\nvernahm  sogleich,  das  hebe  Kind  sei  aus  Schrecken  und \r\nEntsetzen  über  dieses  Ereignis  in  ein  gewaltsames  Fieber \r\nverfallen,  welches  für  ihr  Leben  fürchten  lasse.  Indem \r\nich  mich  nun  tagtäglich,  und  die  erste  Zeit  zweimal,  er- \r\nkundigen ließ,  hatte  ich  die  Pein,  daß  meine  Einbildungs- \r\nkraft sich  etwas  Unmögliches  hervorzubringen  bemüht \r\nwar,  jene  heitern,  dem  offnen  frohen  Tag  allein  gehörigen \r\nZüge,  diesen  Ausdruck  unbefangenen,  still  vorschreitenden \r\nLebens  nunmehr-  durch  Tränen  getrübt,  durch  Krankheit \r\n\r\n\r\n484  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nentstellt  und  eine  so  frische  Jugend  durch  inneres  und \r\näußeres  Leiden  so  frühzeitig  blaß  und  schmächtig  zu \r\ndenken. \r\n\r\nIn  solcher  Stimmung  war  freilich  ein  so  großes  Gegen- \r\ngewicht als  eine  Reihenfolge  des  Bedeutendsten,  das  teils \r\ndem  Auge  durch  sein  Dasein,  teils  der  Einbildungskraft \r\ndurch  nie  verschollene  Würde  genug  zu  tun  gab,  höchst \r\nersehnt  und  nichts  natürlicher,  als  das  meiste  davon  mit \r\ninniger  Trauer  anzublicken. \r\n\r\nWaren  die  alten  Monumente  nach  so  vielen  Jahrhunderten \r\nmeistens  zu  unförmlichen  Massen  zerfallen,  so  mußte  man \r\nbei  neueren  aufrechtstehenden  Prachtgebäuden  gleicher- \r\nmaßen den  Verfall  so  vieler  Familien  in  der  späteren  Zeit \r\nbedauern,  ja  selbst  das  noch  frisch  im  Leben  Erhaltene \r\nschien  an  einem  heimlichen  Wurm  zu  kranken;  denn  wie \r\nwollte  sich  das  Irdische  ohne  eigentlich  physische  Kraft \r\ndurch  sittliche  und  religiöse  Stützen  allein  in  unsern \r\nTagen  aufrecht  erhalten?  Und  wie  einem  heiteren  Sinn \r\nauch  die  Ruine  wieder  zu  beleben,  gleich  einer  frischen, \r\nunsterblichen  Vegetation  verfallene  Mauern  und  zerstreute \r\nBlöcke  wieder  mit  Leben  auszustatten  gelingt,  so  ent- \r\nkleidet ein  trauriger  Sinn  das  lebendige  Dasein  von  seinem \r\nschönsten  Schmuck  und  möchte  es  uns  gern  als  ein  nack- \r\ntes Gerippe  aufdringen. \r\n\r\nAuch  zu  einer  Gebirgsreise,  die  wir  noch  vor  Winters  in \r\nheiterer  Gesellschaft  zu  vollbringen  gedachten,  könnt \r\nich  mich  nicht  entschließen,  bis  ich,  einer  erfolgten  Bes- \r\nserung gewiß  und  durch  sorgfältige  Anstalten  gesichert, \r\nNachricht  von  ihrer  Genesung  auch  an  denen  Orten  er- \r\nhalten sollte,  wo  ich  sie  so  munter  als  liebenswürdig  in \r\nden  schönsten  Herbsttagen  kennen  gelernt  hatte. \r\n\r\nSchon  die  ersten  Briefe  aus  W'eimar  über  Egmont  ent- \r\nhielten einige  Ausstellungen  über  dieses  und  jenes;  hiebei \r\nerneute  sich  die  alte  Bemerkung,  daß  der  unpoetische,  in \r\nseinem  bürgerlichen  Behagen  bequeme  Kunstfreund  ge- \r\nwöhnlich da  einen  Anstoß  nimmt,  wo  der  Dichter  ein \r\nProblem  aufzulösen,  zu  beschönigen  oder  zu  verstecken \r\nge.sucht  hat.    Alles  soll,  so  will  es  der  behagliche  Leser, \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  485 \r\n\r\nim  natürlichen  Gange  fortgehen;  aber  auch  das  Unge- \r\nwöhnliche kann  natürlich  sein,  scheint  es  aber  demjenigen \r\nnicht,  der  auf  seinen  eigenen  Ansichten  verharrt.  Ein \r\nBrief  dieses  Inhalts  war  angekommen,  ich  nahm  ihn  und \r\nging  in  die  Villa  Borghese;  da  mußt  ich  denn  lesen,  daß \r\neinige  Szenen  für  zu  lang  gehalten  würden.  Ich  dachte \r\nnach,  hätte  sie  aber  auch  jetzt  nicht  zu  verkürzen  gewußt, \r\nindem  so  wichtige  Motive  zu  entwickeln  waren.  Was \r\naber  am  meisten  den  Freundinnen  tadelnswert  schien, \r\nwar  das  lakonische  Vermächtnis,  womit  Egmont  sein  Klär- \r\nchen  an  Ferdinand  empfiehlt. \r\n\r\nEin  Auszug  aus  meinem  damaligen  Antwortschreiben  wird \r\nüber  meine  Gesinnungen  und  Zustände  den  besten  Auf- \r\nschluß geben. \r\n\r\n'Wie  sehr  wünscht  ich  nun  auch  euren  Wunsch  erfüllen \r\nund  dem  Vermächtnis  Egmonts  einige  Modifikation  geben \r\nzu  können!  Ich  eilte  an  einem  herrlichen  Morgen  mit \r\neurem  Briefe  gleich  in  die  Villa  Borghese,  dachte  zwei \r\nStunden  den  Gang  des  Stücks,  die  Charaktere,  die  Ver- \r\nhältnisse durch  und  konnte  nichts  finden,  das  ich  abzu- \r\nkürzen hätte.  Wie  gern  möcht  ich  euch  alle  meine  Über- \r\nlegungen, mein  pro  und  contra  schreiben!  sie  würden  ein \r\nBuch  Papier  füllen  und  eine  Dissertation  über  die  Öko- \r\nnomie meines  Stücks  enthalten.  Sonntags  kam  ich  zu \r\nAngelica  und  legte  ihr  die  Frage  vor.  Sie  hat  das  Stück \r\nstudiert  und  besitzt  eine  Abschrift  davon.  Möchtest  du \r\ndoch  gegenwärtig  gewesen  sein,  wie  weiblich  zart  sie  alles \r\nauseinanderlegte  und  es  darauf  hinausging:  daß  das,  was \r\nihr  noch  mündlich  von  dem  Helden  erklärt  wünschtet,  in \r\nder  Erscheinung  implicite  enthalten  sei.  Angelica  sagte: \r\nda  die  Erscheinung  nur  vorstelle,  was  in  dem  Gemüte  des \r\nschlafenden  Helden  vorgehe,  so  könne  er  mit  keinen \r\nWorten  stärker  ausdrücken,  wie  sehr  er  sie  liebe  und \r\nschätze,  als  es  dieser  Traum  tue,  der  das  liebenswürdige \r\nGeschöpf  nicht  zu  ihm  herauf,  sondern  über  ihn  hinauf \r\nhebe.  Ja  es  wolle  ihr  wohl  gefallen,  daß  der,  welcher \r\ndurch  sein  ganzes  Leben  gleichsam  wachend  geträumt, \r\nLeben  und  Liebe  mehr  als  geschätzt  oder  vielmehr  nur \r\ndurch  den  Genuß  geschätzt,  daß  dieser  zuletzt  noch  gleich- \r\n\r\n\r\n486  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nsam  träumend  wache  und  uns  still  gesagt  werde,  wie  tief \r\ndie  Geliebte  in  seinem  Herzen  wohne  und  welche  vor- \r\nnehme und  hohe  Stelle  sie  darin  einnehme. — Es  kamen \r\nnoch  mehr  Betrachtungen  dazAi,  daß  in  der  Szene  mit \r\nFerdinand  Klärchens  nur  auf  eine  subordinierte  Weise  ge- \r\ndacht werden  konnte,  um  das  Interesse  des  Abschieds  von \r\ndem  jungen  Freunde  nicht  zu  schmälern,  der  ohnehin  in \r\ndiesem  Augenblicke  nichts  zu  hören  noch  zu  erkennen \r\nimstande  war.\" \r\n\r\nMoritz  als  Etymolog \r\n\r\nSchon  längst  hat  ein  weiser  Mann  das  wahre  Wort  aus- \r\ngesprochen: Der  Mensch,  dessen  Kräfte  zu  dem  Notwen- \r\ndigen und  Nützlichen  nicht  hinreichen,  mag  sich  gern  mit \r\ndem  Unnötigen  und  Unnützen  beschäftigen!  Vielleicht \r\nmöchte  nachstehendes  von  manchem  auf  diese  Weise  be- \r\nurteilt werden. \r\n\r\nUnser  Geselle  Moritz  ließ  nicht  ab,  jetzt,  in  dem  Kreise \r\nder  höchsten  Kunst  und  schönsten  Natur,  über  die  Inner- \r\nlichkeiten des  Menschen,  seine  Anlagen  und  Kntwicke- \r\nlungen  fortwährend  zu  sinnen  und  zu  spinnen;  deshalb  er \r\ndenn  auch  sich  mit  dem  Allgemeinen  der  Sprache  vor- \r\nzüglich beschäftigte. \r\n\r\nZu  jener  Zeit  war  in  Gefolg  der  Herderischen  Preisschrift \r\nüber  den  Ursprung  der  Sprache  und  in  Gemäßheit  der \r\ndamaligen  allgemeinen  Denkweise  die  Vorstellung  herr- \r\nschend: das  Menschengeschlecht  habe  sich  nicht  von  einem \r\nPaare  aus  dem  hohen  Orient  herab  über  die  ganze  Erde \r\nverbreitet,  sondern  zu  einer  gewissen  merkwürdig  pro- \r\nduktiven Zeit  des  Erdballs  sei,  nachdem  die  Natur  die \r\nverschiedenartigsten  Tiere  stufenweis  hervorzubringen \r\nversucht,  da  und  dort,  in  mancher  günstigen  Lage,  die \r\nMenschenart  melir  oder  weniger  vollendet  hervorgetreten. \r\nGanz  im  innerlichsten  Bezug  auf  seine  Organe  sowohl \r\nals  seine  Geistesfähigkeiten  sei  nun  dem  Menschen  die \r\nSprache  angeboren.  Hier  bedürfe  es  keiner  übernatür- \r\nlichen Anleitung,  so  wenig  als  einer  Überlieferung.  Und \r\nin  diesem  Sinne  gebe  es  eine  allgemeine  Sprache,  welche \r\nzu  manifestieren  ein  jeder  autochthonische  Stamm  ver- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1787  487 \r\n\r\nsucht  habe.  Die  Verwandtschaft  aller  Sprachen  liege  in \r\nder  Übereinstimmung  der  Idee,  wonach  die  schaffende \r\nKraft  das  menschliche  Geschlecht  und  seinen  Organismus \r\ngebildet.  Daher  komme  denn,  daß  teils  aus  innerem \r\nGrundtriebe,  teils  durch  äußere  Veranlassung  die  sehr \r\nbeschränkte  Vokal-  und  Konsonantenzahl  zum  Ausdruck \r\nvon  Gefühlen  und  Vorstellungen  richtig  oder  unrichtig \r\nangewendet  worden;  da  es  denn  natürlich,  ja  notwendig \r\nsei,  daß  die  verschiedensten  Autochthonen  teils  zusam- \r\nmengetroffen, teils  voneinander  abgewichen  und  sich \r\ndiese  oder  jene  Sprache  in  der  Folge  entweder  verschlim- \r\nmert oder  verbessert  habe.  Was  von  den  Stammworten \r\ngelte,  gelte  denn  auch  von  den  Ableitungen,  wodurch  die \r\nBezüge  der  einzelnen  Begriffe  und  Vorstellungen  ausge- \r\ndrückt imd  bestimmter  bezeichnet  werden.  Dies  möchte \r\ndenn  gut  sein  und  als  ein  Unerforschliches,  nie  mit  Ge- \r\nwißheit zu  Bestimmendes  auf  sich  beruhen. \r\nHierüber  find  ich  in  meinen  Papieren  folgendes  Nähere: \r\n\"Mir  ist  es  angenehm,  daß  sich  Moritz  aus  seiner  brüten- \r\nden Trägheit,  aus  dem  Unmut  und  Zweifel  an  sich  selbst \r\nzu  einer  Art  von  Tätigkeit  wendet;  denn  da  wird  er  aller- \r\nliebst. Seine  Grillenfängereien  haben  alsdann  eine  wahre \r\nUnterlage  und  seine  Träumereien  Zweck  und  Sinn.  Jetzt \r\nbeschäftigt  ihn  eine  Idee,  in  welche  ich  auch  eingegangen \r\nbin  und  die  uns  sehr  unterhält.  Es  ist  schwer,  sie  mit- \r\nzuteilen, weil  es  gleich  toll  klingt.  Doch  will  ichs  ver- \r\nsuchen. \r\n\r\n\"Er  hat  ein  Verstands-  und  Empfindungsalphabet  erfun- \r\nden, wodurch  er  zeigt,  daß  die  Buchstaben  nicht  will- \r\nkürlich, sondern  in  der  menschlichen  Natur  gegründet \r\nsind  und  alle  gewissen  Regionen  des  innern  Sinnes  an- \r\ngehören, welchen  sie  denn  auch,  ausgesprochen,  aus- \r\ndrücken. Nun  lassen  sich  nach  diesem  Alphabete  die \r\nSprachen  beurteilen,  und  da  findet  sich,  daß  alle  Völker \r\nversucht  haben,  sich  dem  innern  Sinn  gemäß  auszu- \r\ndrücken; alle  sind  aber  durch  Willkür  und  Zufall  vom \r\nrechten  Wege  abgeleitet  worden.  Demzufolge  suchen  wir \r\nin  den  Sprachen  die  Worte  auf,  die  am  glücklichsten  ge- \r\ntrofifen  sind:   bald  hats  die  eine,  bald  die  andre;  dann \r\n\r\n\r\n488  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nverändern  wir  die  Worte,  bis  sie  uns  recht  dünken, \r\nmachen  neue  usw.  Ja  wenn  wir  recht  spielen  wollen, \r\nmachen  wir  Namen  für  Menschen,  untersuchen,  ob  diesem \r\noder  jenem  sein  Name  gehöre  usw.  usw. \r\n\"Das  etymologische  Spiel  beschäftigt  schon  so  viele  Men- \r\nschen, und  so  gibt  es  auch  uns  auf  diese  heitere  Weise \r\nviel  zu  tun.  Sobald  wir  zusammenkommen,  wird  es  wie \r\nein  Schachspiel  vorgenommen,  und  hunderterlei  Kombi- \r\nnationen werden  versucht,  so  daß,  wer  uns  zufällig  be- \r\nhorchte, uns  für  wahnsinnig  halten  müßte.  Auch  möchte \r\nich  es  nur  den  allernächsten  Freunden  vertrauen.  Genug, \r\nes  ist  das  witzigste  Spiel  von  der  Welt  und  übt  den \r\nSprachsinn  unglaublich.\" \r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI,  DER  HUMORISTISCHE  HEILIGE \r\n\r\nPHILIPP  Neri,  in  Florenz  geboren  1515,  erscheint  von \r\nKindheit  auf  als  ein  folgsamer  sittlicher  Knabe  von  kräf- \r\ntigen Anlagen.  Sein  Bildnis  als  eines  solchen  ist  glück- \r\nlicherweise aufbewahrt  in  des  Fi danza  Teste  Scelte  Tom.V. \r\n131.  31.  Man  wüßte  sich  keinen  tüchtigem,  gesundem, \r\ngeradsinnigeren  Knaben  zu  denken.  Als  Abkömmling \r\neiner  edlen  Familie  wird  er  in  allem  Guten  und  Wissens- \r\nwerten der  Zeit  gemäß  unterrichtet  und  endlich,  um  seine \r\nStudien  zu  vollenden,  man  meldet  nicht  in  welchem  Alter, \r\nnach  Rom  gesandt.  Hier  entwickelt  er  sich  zum  voU- \r\nkommnen  Jüngling:  sein  schönes  Antlitz,  seine  reichen \r\nLocken  zeichnen  ihn  aus;  er  ist  anziehend  und  ablehnend \r\nzugleich,  Anmut  und  Würde  begleiten  ihn  überall. \r\nHier,  zur  traurigsten  Zeit,  wenige  Jahre  nach  der  grau- \r\nsamen Plünderung  der  Stadt,  ergibt  er  sich,  nach  Vor- \r\ngang und  Beispiel  vieler  Edlen,  ganz  den  Übungen  der \r\nFrömmigkeit,  und  sein  Enthusiasmus  steigert  sich  mit  den \r\nKräften  einer  frischen  Jugend.  Unablässiges  Besuchen  der \r\nKirchen,  besonders  der  sieben  Hauptkirchen,  brünstiges \r\nBeten  zur  Herannötigung  der  Hülfe,  fleißiges  Beichten \r\nund  Genuß  des  Abendmahls,  Flehen  und  Ringen  nach \r\ngeistigen  Gütern. \r\nIn  solch  einem  enthusiastischen  Momente  wirft  er  sich \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  489 \r\n\r\neinst  auf  die  Stufen  des  Altars  und  zerbricht  ein  paar \r\nRippen,  welche,  schlecht  geheilt,  ihm  lebenslängliches \r\nHerzklopfen  verursachen  und  die  Steigerung  seiner  Gefühle \r\nveranlassen. \r\n\r\nUm  ihn  versammeln  sich  junge  Männer  zu  tätiger  Sittlich- \r\nkeit und  Frömmigkeit;  sie  erweisen  sich  unermüdet,  die \r\nArmen  zu  versorgen,  die  Kranken  zu  pflegen,  und  scheinen \r\nihre  Studien  hintanzusetzen.  Wahrscheinlich  bedienen  sie \r\nsich  der  Zuschüsse  von  Haus  zu  wohltätigen  Zwecken; \r\ngenug,  sie  geben  und  helfen  immer  und  behalten  nichts \r\nfür  sich,  ja  er  lehnt  nachher  ausdrücklich  alle  Beihülfe \r\nvon  den  Seinigen  ab,  um  dasjenige,  was  Wohltätigkeit \r\nihnen  zuweiset,  an  Bedürftige  zu  wenden  und  selbst  zu \r\ndarben. \r\n\r\nDergleichen  fromme  Handlungen  waren  jedoch  zu  herz- \r\nlich und  lebhaft,  als  daß  man  nicht  hätte  suchen  sollen, \r\nsich  zugleich  auf  eine  geistliche  und  gefühlvolle  Weise \r\nüber  die  wichtigsten  Gegenstände  zu  unterhalten.  Die \r\nkleine  Gesellschaft  besaß  noch  kein  eigenes  Lokal,  sie \r\nerbat  sichs  bald  in  diesem  bald  in  jenem  Kloster,  wo  der- \r\ngleichen leere  Räume  wohl  zu  finden  sein  mochten.  Nach \r\neinem  kurzen  stillen  Gebet  ward  ein  Text  der  Heiligen \r\nSchrift  verlesen,  worüber  ein  und  der  andere  sich,  aus- \r\nlegend oder  anwendend,  in  einer  kurzen  Rede  vernehmen \r\nließ.  Man  besprach  sich  auch  wolil  hierüber,  alles  in \r\nbezug  auf  unmittelbare  Tätigkeit;  dialektische  und  spitz- \r\nfindige Behandlung  war  durchaus  verboten.  Die  übrige \r\nTageszeit  ward  immerfort  einer  aufmerksamen  Versorgung \r\nder  Kranken,  dem  Dienst  in  Hospitälern,  dem  Beistande \r\nder  Armen  und  Notleidenden  gewidmet. \r\nDa  bei  diesen  Verhältnissen  keine  Beschränkung  vor- \r\nwaltete und  man  ebensogut  kommen  als  gehen  konnte, \r\nso  vermehrte  sich  die  Zahl  der  Teilnehmenden  ungemein, \r\nsowie  sich  denn  auch  jene  Versammlung  ernster  und  um- \r\ngreifender beschäftigte.  Auch  aus  den  Leben  der  Heili- \r\ngen ward  vorgelesen,  Kirchenväter  und  Kirchengeschichte \r\nstellenweise  zu  Rate  gezogen,  worauf  denn  vier  der  Teil- \r\nnehmenden, jeder  eine  halbe  Stunde,  zu  sprechen  das \r\nRecht  und  Pflicht  hatten. \r\n\r\n\r\n49 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDiese  fromme  tagtägliche,  ja  familiär  praktische  Behand- \r\nlung der  höchsten  Seelenangelegenheiten  erregte  immer \r\nmehr  Aufmerksamkeit,  nicht  allein  unter  einzelnen,  sondern \r\nsogar  unter  ganzen  Körperschaften.  Man  verlegte  die \r\nVersammlungen  in  die  Kreuzgänge  und  Räume  dieser \r\nund  jener  Kirche,  der  Zudrang  vermehrte  sich;  besonders \r\nzeigte  sich  der  Orden  der  Dominikaner  dieser  Art,  sich \r\nzu  erbauen,  sehr  geneigt  und  schloß  sich  zahlreich  an  die \r\nsich  immer  mehr  ausbildende  Schar  an,  welche  durch  die \r\nKraft  und  den  hohen  Sinn  ihres  Anführers  sich  durchaus \r\ngleidi  und,  wenn  auch  geprüft  durch  mancherlei  Wider- \r\nwärtigkeiten, auf  demselben  Pfade  fortschreitend  finden \r\nließ. \r\n\r\nDa  nun  aber  nach  dem  hohen  Sinne  des  treft'lichen  Vor- \r\ngesetzten alle  Spekulation  verbannt,  jede  geregelte  Tätig- \r\nkeit aber  aufs  Leben  gerichtet  war  und  das  Leben  sich \r\nohne  Heiterkeit  nicht  denken  läßt,  so  wußte  der  Mann \r\nauch  hierin  den  unschuldigen  Bedürfnissen  und  Wünschen \r\nder  Seinigen  entgegenzukommen.  Bei  eintretendem  Früh- \r\nling führte  er  sie  nach  San  Onofrio,  welches,  hoch  und \r\nbreit  gelegen,  in  solchen  Tagen  die  angenehmste  Örtlich - \r\nkeit  anbot.  Hier,  wo  bei  der  jungen  Jahrszeit  alles  jung \r\nerscheinen  sollte,  trat,  nach  stillen  Gebeten,  ein  hübscher \r\nKnabe  hervor,  rezitierte  eine  auswendig  gelernte  Predigt, \r\nGebete  folgten,  und  ein  Chor  besonders  eingeladener \r\nSänger  ließ  sich  erfreulich  und  eindringlich  zum  Schlussc \r\nhören,  welches  um  so  bedeutender  war,  als  die  Musik \r\ndamals  weder  ausgebreitet  noch  ausgebildet  gefunden \r\nward  und  hier  vielleicht  zum  erstenmal  ein  religiöser  Ge- \r\nsang in  freier  Luft  sich  mitteilte. \r\n\r\nImmer  auf  diese  Weise  fortwirkend,  vermehrte  sich  die \r\nKongregation  und  wuchs,  so  wie  an  Personenzahl,  so  an \r\nBedeutung.  Die  Florentiner  nötigten  gleichsam  ihren \r\nLandsmann,  das  von  ihnen  abhängige  Kloster  San  Giro- \r\nlamo  zu  beziehen,  wo  denn  die  Anstalt  sich  immer  mehr \r\nausdehnte  und  auf  gleiche  Weise  fortwirkte,  bis  ihnen \r\nendlich  der  Papst  in  der  Nähe  des  Platzes  Navona  ein \r\nKloster  als  eigentümlich  anwies,  welches,  von  Grund  aus \r\nneu  gebaut,  eine  gute  Anzahl  frommer  Genossen  aufneh- \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  491 \r\n\r\nmen  konnte.  Hier  blieb  es  jedoch  bei  der  früheren  Ein- \r\nrichtung, Gottes  Wort,  das  will  sagen  heilig  edle  Gesin- \r\nnungen, dem  gemeinen  Verstände  sowie  dem  gemeinen \r\nAlltagsleben  anzunähern  und  eigen  zu  machen.  Man  ver- \r\nsammelte sich  nach  wie  vor,  betete,  vernahm  einen  Text, \r\nhörte  darüber  sprechen,  betete  und  ward  zuletzt  durch  Mu- \r\nsik ergötzt,  und  was  damals  öfter,  ja  täglich  geschah,  ge- \r\nschieht jetzt  noch  Sonntags;  und  gewiß  wird  jeder  Reisende, \r\nder  nähere  Kenntnis  von  dem  heiligen  Stifter  genommen, \r\nsich  künftighin,  diesen  unschuldigen  Funktionen  beiwoh- \r\nnend, vorzüglich  erbauen,  wenn  er  dasjenige,  was  wir \r\nvorgetragen  haben  und  zunächst  mitteilen,  in  Gemüt  und \r\nGedanke  vorüberwalten  läßt. \r\n\r\nHier  sind  wir  nun  in  dem  Falle,  in  Erinnerung  zu  bringen, \r\ndaß  diese  ganze  Anstalt  noch  immer  ans  Weltliche  grenzte. \r\nWie  denn  nur  wenige  unter  ihnen  sich  dem  eigentlichen \r\nPriesterstande  gewidmet  hatten  und  nur  so  viel  geweihte \r\nGeistliche  unter  ihnen  gefunden  wurden  als  nötig,  Beichte \r\nzu  sitzen  und  das  Meßopfer  zu  verrichten.  Und  so  war \r\ndenn  auch  Philipp  Neri  selbst  sechsunddreißig  Jahre  alt \r\ngeworden,  ohne  sich  zum  Priestertum  zu  melden:  denn  er \r\nfand  sich,  wie  es  scheint,  in  seinem  gegenwärtigen  Zu- \r\nstande frei  und  weit  mehr  sich  selbst  überlassen,  als  er \r\nsich,  mit  kirchlichen  Banden  gefesselt,  als  Glied  der  großen \r\nHierarchie,  zwar  hochgeehrt,  aber  doch  beschränkt,  ge- \r\nfühlt hätte. \r\n\r\nAllein  von  oben  her  ließ  man  es  dabei  nicht  bewenden: \r\nsein  Beichtvater  machte  es  ihm  zur  Gewissenssache,  die \r\nWeihe  zu  nehmen  und  in  den  Priesterstand  zu  treten. \r\nUnd  so  geschah  es  auch;  nun  hatte  die  Kirche  klüglich \r\neinen  Mann  in  ihren  Kreis  eingeschlossen,  der,  unab- \r\nhängigen Geistes  bisher,  auf  einen  Zustand  losging,  worin \r\ndas  Heilige  mit  dem  Weltlichen,  das  Tugendsame  mit \r\ndem  x'Vlltäglichen  sich  vereinigen  und  vertragen  sollte. \r\nDiese  Veränderung  aber,  der  Übergang  zur  Priesterschaft, \r\nscheint  auf  sein  äußeres  Benehmen  nicht  im  mindesten \r\neingewirkt  zu  haben. \r\n\r\nEr  übt  nur  noch  strenger  als  bisher  jede  Entäußerung  und \r\nlebt  in  einem  schlechten  Klösterchen  mit  andern  kümmer- \r\n\r\n\r\n492  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nlieh  zusammen.  So  gibt  er  die  bei  großer  Teuriing  ihm \r\nverehrten  Brote  einem  andern,  Bedürftigern  und  setzt \r\nseinen  Dienst  gegen  Unglückliche  immer  fort. \r\nAber  auf  sein  Inneres  hat  das  Priestertum  einen  merk- \r\nwürdig steigernden  Einfluß.  Die  Verpflichtung  zum  Meß- \r\nopfer versetzt  ihn  in  einen  Enthusiasmus,  in  eine  Ekstase, \r\nwo  man  den  bisher  so  natürlichen  Mann  gänzlich  verliert. \r\nEr  weiß  kaum,  wohin  er  schreitet,  er  taumelt  auf  dem \r\nWege  und  vor  dem  Altare.  Hebt  er  die  Hostie  in  die \r\nHöhe,  so  kann  er  die  Arme  nicht  wieder  herunterbringen; \r\nes  scheint,  als  zöge  ihn  eine  unsichtbare  Kraft  empor. \r\nBeim  Eingießen  des  Weins  zittert  und  schaudert  er,  und \r\nwenn  er  nach  vollendeter  Wandlung  dieser  geheimnis- \r\nvollen Gaben  genießen  soll,  erzeigt  er  sich  auf  eine  wunder- \r\nliche, nicht  auszusprechende  schwelgerische  Weise.  Vor \r\nLeidenschaft  beißt  er  in  den  Kelch,  indes  er  ahnungsvoll \r\ndas  Blut  zu  schlürfen  glaubt  des  kurz  vorher  gleichsam \r\n.gierig  verschlungenen  Leibes.  Ist  aber  dieser  Taumel \r\nvorüber,  so  finden  wir  zwar  immer  einen  leidenschaftlich \r\nwundersamen,  aber  immer  höchst  verständig  praktischen \r\nMann. \r\n\r\nEin  solcher  Jüngling,  ein  solcher  Mann,  so  lebhaft  und \r\nseltsam  wirkend,  mußte  den  Menschen  wunderlich  und \r\nmitunter  gerade  durch  seine  Tugenden  beschwerlich  und \r\nwiderwärtig  vorkommen.  Wahrscheinlich  ist  ihm  dieses \r\nin  dem  Laufe  seines  früheren  Lebens  oft  begegnet;  nach- \r\ndem er  aber  zum  Priester  geweiht  ist  und  sich  so  eng  und \r\nkümmerlich,  gleichsam  als  Gast,  in  einem  armseligen \r\nKloster  behilft,  treten  Widersacher  auf,  die  ihn  mit  Spott \r\nund  Hohn  unablässig  verfolgen. \r\n\r\nDoch  wir  gehen  weiter  und  sagen,  er  sei  ein  höchst  aus- \r\ngezeichneter Mensch  gewesen,  der  aber  das  einem  jeden \r\ndieser  Art  angeborne  Herrische  zu  belierrschen  und  in \r\nEntsagung,  En tbehrung,  Wohltätigkeit,  Demut  und  Schmach \r\nden  Glanz  seines  Daseins  zu  verhüllen  trachtete.  Der \r\nGedanke,  vor  der  Welt  als  töricht  zu  erscheinen  und  da- \r\ndurch in  Gott  und  göttliche  Dinge  sich  erst  recht  zu  ver- \r\nsenken und  zu  üben,  war  sein  andauerndes  Bestreben, \r\nwodurch  er  sich  und  sodann  auch  seine  Schüler  ausschließ- \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  493 \r\n\r\nlieh  zu  erziehen  unternahm.  Die  Maxime  des  heiligen \r\nBernhard : \r\n\r\nSpernere  mundum, \r\nSpernere  neminem, \r\nSpernere  se  ipsum, \r\nSpernere  se  sperni, \r\n\r\nschien  ihn  ganz  durchdrungen  zu  haben,  ja  vielmehr  aus \r\nihm  frisch  wieder  entwickelt  zu  sein. \r\nÄhnliche  Absichten,  ähnliche  Zustände  nötigen  den  Men- \r\nschen, in  gleichen  Maximen  sich  aufzuerbauen.  Man  kann \r\ngewiß  sein,  daß  die  erhabensten,  innerlich  stolzesten \r\nMenschen  sich  zu  jenen  Grundsätzen  allein  bequemen, \r\nindem  sie  das  Widerwärtige  einer  dem  Guten  und  Großen \r\nimmer  widerstrebenden  Welt  voraus  zu  kosten  und  den \r\nbittern  Kelch  der  Erfahrung,  eh  er  ihnen  noch  angeboten \r\nist,  bis  auf  den  Grund  zu  leeren  sich  entschließen.  Gren- \r\nzenlos und  in  ununterbrochener  Reihe  machen  jene  Ge- \r\nschichtchen, wie  er  seine  Schüler  geprüft,  deren  viele  bis \r\nauf  uns  gekommen  sind,  jeden  lebenslustigen  Menschen, \r\nder  sie  vernimmt,  wirklich  ungeduldig,  so  wie  diese  Ge- \r\nbote demjenigen,  der  ihnen  gehorchen  sollte,  höchst \r\nschmerzlich  und  nahezu  unerträglich  fallen  mußten.  Des- \r\nwegen denn  auch  nicht  alle  eine  solche  Feuerprobe  be- \r\nstanden. \r\n\r\nEh  wir  aber  uns  auf  dergleichen  wunderbare  und  dem \r\nLeser  gewissermaßen  unwillkommne  Erzählungen  ein- \r\nlassen, wenden  wir  uns  lieber  noch  einmal  zu  jenen  großen \r\nVorzügen,  welche  die  Zeitgenossen  ihm  zugestehen  und \r\nhöchlich  rühmen.  Er  habe,  sagen  sie,  Kenntnisse  und \r\nBildung  mehr  von  Natur  als  durch  Unterricht  und  Er- \r\nziehung erhalten;  alles,  was  andere  mühsam  erwerben, \r\nsei  ihm  gleichsam  eingegossen  gewesen.  Ferner  habe  er \r\ndie  große  Gabe  zu  eigen  gehabt,  Geister  zu  unterscheiden, \r\nEigenschaften  und  Fähigkeiten  der  Menschen  zu  würdigen \r\nund  zu  schätzen;  zugleich  habe  er  mit  dem  größten  Scharf- \r\nsinn die  weltlichen  Dinge  durchdrungen,  auf  einen  Grad, \r\ndaß  man  ihm  den  Geist  der  Wahrsagung  zuschreiben \r\nmüssen.    Auch  ward  ihm  eine  entschiedene  Anziehunafs- \r\n\r\n\r\n494  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\ngäbe,  welche  auszudrücken  die  Italiener  sich  des  schönen \r\nWortes  atirattiva  bedienen,  kräftig  verliehen,  die  sich \r\nnicht  allein  auf  Menschen  erstreckte,  sondern  auch  auf \r\nTiere.  Als  Beispiel 'wird  erzählt,  daß  der  Hund  eines \r\nFreundes  sich  ihm  angeschlossen  und  durchaus  gefolgt \r\nsei,  auch  bei  dem  ersten  Besitzer,  der  ihn  lebhaft  zurück- \r\ngewünscht und  durch  mancherlei  Mittel  ihn  wiederzuge- \r\nwinnen getrachtet,  auf  keine  Weise  verbleiben  wollen, \r\nsondern  sich  immer  zu  dem  anziehenden  Manne  zurück- \r\nbegeben, sich  niemals  von  ihm  getrennt,  vielmehr  zuletzt \r\nnach  mehreren  Jahren  in  dem  Schlafzimmer  seines  er- \r\nwählten Herrn  das  Leben  geendet  habe.  Dieses  Geschöpf \r\nveranlaßt  uns  nun,  auf  jene  Prüfungen,  zu  denen  es  selbst \r\nGelegenheit  gegeben,  zurückzukommen.  Es  ist  bekannt, \r\ndaß  Hundeführen,  Hundetragen  im  Mittelalter  überhaupt \r\nund  wahrscheinlich  auch  in  Rom  höchst  schimpflich  ge- \r\nwesen. In  dieser  Rücksicht  pflegte  der  fromme  Mann \r\njenes  Tier  an  einer  Kette  durch  die  Stadt  zu  führen;  auch \r\nmußten  seine  Schüler  dasselbe  auf  den  Armen  durch  die \r\nStraßen  tragen  und  sich  auf  diese  Weise  dem  Gelächter \r\nund  Spott  der  Menge  preisgeben. \r\n\r\nAuch  mutete  er  seinen  Schülern  und  Genossen  andere \r\nunwürdige  Äußerlichkeiten  zu.  Einem  jungen  römischen \r\nFürsten,  welcher  der  Ehre,  für  ein  Ordensglied  zu  gelten, \r\nmitgenießen  wollte,  wurde  angesonnen,  er  solle  mit  einem \r\nhinten  angehefteten  Fuchsschwänze  durch  Rom  spazieren, \r\nund,  als  er  dies  zu  leisten  sich  weigerte,  die  Aufnahme \r\nin  den  Orden  versagt.  Einen  andern  schickte  er  ohne \r\nÜberkleid,  und  wieder  einen  mit  zerrißnen  Ärmeln  durch \r\ndie  Stadt.  Dieses  letztern  erbarmte  sich  ein  Edelmann \r\nund  bot  ihm  ein  Paar  neue  Ärmel  an,  die  der  Jüngling \r\nausschlug,  nachher  aber,  auf  Befehl  des  Meisters,  dank- \r\nbar abholen  und  tragen  mußte.  Beim  Bau  der  neuen \r\nKirche  nötigte  er  die  Seinen,  gleich  Taglöhnern  die  Ma- \r\nterialien herbeizuschaffen  und  sie  den  Arbeitern  zur  Hand \r\nzu  langen. \r\n\r\nGleichermaßen  wußte  er  auch  jedes  geistige  Behagen, \r\ndas  der  Mensch  an  sich  empfinden  mochte,  zu  stören  und \r\nzu  vernichten.   Wenn  die  Predigt  eines  jungen  Mannes \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  495 \r\n\r\nwohl  zu  gelingen  und  der  Redner  sich  darin  selbst  zu \r\ngefallen  schien,  unterbrach  er  ihn  in  der  Mitte  des  Worts, \r\num  an  seiner  Stelle  weiter  zu  sprechen,  befahl  auch  wohl \r\nweniger  fähigen  Schülern,  ungesäumt  hinaufzutreten  und \r\nzu  beginnen,  welche  denn,  so  unerwartet  angeregt,  sich \r\naus  dem  Stegreife  besser  als  je  zu  erweisen  das  Glück \r\nhatten. \r\n\r\nMan  versetze  sich  in  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  sechzehnten \r\nJahrhunderts  und  den  wüsten  Zustand,  in  welchem  Rom \r\nunter  verschiedenen  Päpsten  wie  ein  aufgeregtes  Ele- \r\nment erschien,  und  man  wird  eher  begreifen,  daß  ein \r\nsolches  Verfahren  wirksam  und  mächtig  sein  mußte,  in- \r\ndem es  durch  Neigung  und  Furcht,  durch  Ergebenheit \r\nund  Gehorsam  dem  innersten  Wollen  des  Menschen  die \r\ngroße  Gewalt  verlieh,  trotz  allem  Äußern  sich  zu  er- \r\nhalten, um  allem,  was  sich  ereignen  konnte,  zu  wider- \r\nstehen, da  es  befähigt,  selbst  dem  Vernünftigen  und \r\nVerständigen,  dem  Herkömmlichen  und  Schicklichen  un- \r\nbedingt zu  entsagen. \r\n\r\nEine  merkwürdige,  obgleich  schon  bekannte  Prüfungs- \r\ngeschichte wird  man  hier  wegen  ihrer  besondern  Anmut \r\nnicht  ungern  wiederholt  finden.  Dem  heiligen  Vater  war \r\nangekündigt,  in  einem  Kloster  auf  dem  Lande  tue  sich \r\neine  wunderwirkende  Nonne  hervor.  Unser  Mann  erhält \r\nden  Auftrag,  eine  für  die  Kirche  so  wichtige  Angelegen- \r\nheit näher  zu  untersuchen;  er  setzt  sich  auf  sein  Maultier, \r\ndas  Befohlene  zu  verrichten,  kommt  aber  schneller  zu- \r\nrück, als  der  heilige  Vater  es  erwartet.  Der  Verwunde- \r\nrung seines  geistlichen  Gebieters  begegnet  Neri  mit \r\nfolgenden  Worten :  Heiligster  Vater,  diese  tut  kein  Wun- \r\nder, denn  es  fehlt  ihr  an  der  ersten  christlichen  Tugend, \r\nder  Demut.  Ich  komme,  durch  schlimmen  Weg  und \r\nWetter  übel  zugerichtet,  im  Kloster  an;  ich  lasse  sie  in \r\nEurem  Namen  vor  mich  fordern:  sie  erscheint,  und  ich \r\nreiche  ihr  statt  des  Grußes  den  Stiefel  hin,  mit  der  An- \r\ndeutung, sie  solle  mir  ihn  ausziehen.  Entsetzt  fährt  sie \r\nzurück,  und  mit  Schelten  und  Zorn  erwidert  sie  mein \r\nAnsinnen;  für  was  ich  sie  halte!  ruft  sie  aus;  die  Magd \r\ndes  Herrn  sei  sie,   aber  nicht  eines  jeden,  der  daher- \r\n\r\n\r\n496  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nkomme,  um  knechtische  Dienste  von  ihr  zu  verlangen. \r\nIch  erhiib  mich  gelassen,  setzte  mich  wieder  auf  mein \r\nTier,  stehe  wieder  vor  Euch,  und  ich  bin  überzeugt,  Ihr \r\nwerdet  keine  weitere  Prüfung  nötig  finden. — Lächelnd \r\nbeließ  es  auch  der  Papst  dabei,  und  wahrscheinlich  ward \r\nihr  das  fernere  Wundertun  untersagt. \r\nWenn  er  aber  sich  dergleichen  Prüfungen  gegen  andere \r\nerlaubte,  so  mußte  er  solche  von  Männern  erdulden, \r\nwelche,  gleichen  Sinnes,  den  nämlichen  Weg  der  Selbst- \r\nverleugnung einschlugen.  Ein  Bettelmönch,  der  aber  auch \r\nschon  im  Geruch  der  Heihgkeit  stand,  begegnet  ihm  in \r\nder  gangbarsten  Straße  und  bietet  ihm  einen  Schluck  aus \r\nder  Weinflasche,  die  er  vorsorglich  mit  sich  führt.  Phi- \r\nlipp Neri  bedenkt  sich  nicht  einen  Augenblick  und  setzt \r\ndie  langhalsige  Korbflasche,  den  Kopf  zurückbiegend, \r\ndreist  an  den  Mund,  indes  das  Volk  laut  lacht  und  spottet, \r\ndaß  zwei  fromme  Männer  sich  dergestalt  zutrinken.  Phi- \r\nlipp Neri,  den  es,  ohngeachtet  seiner  Frömmigkeit  und \r\nErgebung,  einigermaßen  dürfte  verdrossen  haben,  sagte \r\ndarauf:  Ihr  habt  mich  geprüft,  nun  ist  die  Reihe  an  mir \r\n—und  drückte  zugleich  sein  vierecktes  Barett  auf  den \r\nKahlkopf,  welcher  nun  gleichfalls  ausgelacht  wurde,  ganz \r\nruhig  fortging  und  sagte:  Wenn  mirs  einer  vom  Kopf \r\nnimmt,  so  mögt  Ihrs  haben!  Neri  nahm  es  ihm  ab,  und \r\nsie  schieden. \r\n\r\nFreilich  dergleichen  zu  wagen  und  dennoch  die  größten \r\nsittlichen  Wirkungen  hervorzubringen,  bedurfte  es  eines \r\nMannes  wie  Philipp  Neri,  dessen  Handlungen  gar  oft  als \r\nWunder  anzusehen  waren.  Als  Beichtiger  machte  er  sich \r\nfurchtbar  und  daher  des  größten  Zutrauens  würdig;  er \r\nentdeckte  seinen  Beichtkindern  Sünden,  die  sie  ver- \r\nschwiegen, Mängel,  die  sie  nicht  beachtet  hatten.  Sein \r\nbrünstiges  ekstatisches  Gebet  setzte  seine  Umgebungen \r\nals  übernatürlich  in  Erstaunen,  in  einen  Zustand,  in  wel- \r\nchem die  Menschen  wohl  auch  durch  ihre  Sinne  zu  er- \r\nfahren glauben,  was  ihnen  die  Einbildungskraft,  angeregt \r\ndurchs  Gefühl,  vorbilden  mochte.  Wozu  denn  noch \r\nkommt,  daß  das  Wunderbare,  ja  das  Unmögliche,  erzählt \r\nund  wieder  erzählt,  endlich  vollkommen  die  Stelle  des \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  497 \r\n\r\nWirklichen,  des  Alltäglichen  einnimmt.  Hierher  gehört, \r\ndaß  man  ihn  nicht  allein  verschiedentlich  während  des \r\nMeßopfers  vor  dem  Altare  wollte  emporgehoben  gesehen \r\nhaben,  sondern  daß  sich  auch  Zeugnisse  fanden,  man \r\nhabe  ihn,  knieend  um  das  Leben  eines  gefährlichst  Kran- \r\nken betend,  dergestalt  von  der  Erde  emporgehoben  er- \r\nblickt, daß  er  mit  dem  Haupte  beinahe  die  Decke  des \r\nZimmers  berührt. \r\n\r\nBei  einem  solchen  durchaus  dem  Gefühl  und  der  Einbil- \r\ndungskraft gewidmeten  Zustande  war  es  ganz  natürlich, \r\ndaß  die  Einmischung  auch  widerwärtiger  Dämonen  nicht \r\nganz  auszubleiben  schien. \r\n\r\nOben  zwischen  dem  verfallenen  Gemäuer  der  Antonini- \r\nschen  Bäder  sieht  wohl  einmal  der  fromme  Mann  in \r\näffischerUngestalt  ein  widerwärtiges  Wesen  herumhupfen, \r\ndas  aber  auf  sein  Geheiß  alsogleich  zwischen  Trümmern \r\nund  Spalten  verschwindet.  Bedeutender  jedoch  als  diese \r\nEinzelnheit  ist,  wie  er  gegen  seine  Schüler  verfährt,  die \r\nihn  von  seligen  Erscheinungen,  womit  sie  von  der  Mutter \r\nGottes  und  andern  Heiligen  beglückt  worden,  mit  Ent- \r\nzücken benachrichtigen.  Er,  wohl  wissend,  daß  aus \r\ndergleichen  Einbildungen  ein  geistlicher  Dünkel,  der \r\nschlimmste  und  hartnäckigste  von  allen,  gewöhnlich  ent- \r\nspringe, versichert  sie  deshalb,  daß  hinter  dieser  himm- \r\nlischen Klarheit  und  Schönheit  gewiß  eine  teuflische, \r\nhäßliche  Finsternis  verborgen  liege.  Dieses  zu  erproben, \r\ngebietet  er  ihnen,  bei  der  Wiederkehr  einer  so  holdseligen \r\nJungfrau  ihr  gerade  ins  Gesicht  zu  speien;  sie  gehorchen, \r\nund  der  Erfolg  bewährt  sich,  indem  auf  der  Stelle  eine \r\nTeufelslarve  hervortritt. \r\n\r\nDer  große  Mann  mag  dieses  mit  Bewußtsein  oder,  was \r\nwahrscheinlicher  ist,  aus  tiefem  Instinkt  geboten  haben; \r\ngenug,  er  war  sicher,  daß  jenes  Bild,  welches  eine  phan- \r\ntastische Liebe  und  Sehnsucht  hervorgerufen  hatte,  nun, \r\ndurch  das  entgegenwirkende  Wagnis  von  Haß  und  Ver- \r\nachtung, unmittelbar  in  eine  Fratze  sich  verwandeln \r\nwürde. \r\n\r\nIhn  berechtigten  jedoch  zu  einer  so  seltsamen  Pädagogik \r\ndie  außerordentlichsten,  zwischen  den  höchst  geistigen \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  32 \r\n\r\n\r\n498  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nund  höchst  körperlichen  schwebend  erscheinenden  Na- \r\nturgaben: Gefühl  einer  sich  nahenden  noch  ungesehenen \r\nPerson,  Ahnung  entfernter  Begebenheiten,  Bewußtsein \r\nder  Gedanken  eines  vor  ihm  Stehenden,  Nötigung  anderer \r\nzu  seinen  Gedanken. \r\n\r\nDiese  und  dergleichen  Gaben  sind  unter  mehreren  Men- \r\nschen ausgeteilt,  mancher  kann  sich  derselben  ein  und \r\ndas  andere  Mal  rühmen;  aber  die  ununterbrochene  Ge- \r\ngenwart solcher  Fähigkeiten,  die  in  jedem  Falle  bereite \r\nAusübung  einer  so  staunenswürdigen  Wirksamkeit,  dies \r\nist  vielleicht  nur  in  einem  Jahrhundert  zu  denken,  wo \r\nzusammengehaltene,  unzersplitterte  Geistes-  und  Kör- \r\nperkräfte sich  mit  erstaunenswürdiger  Energie  hervortun \r\nkonnten. \r\n\r\nBetrachten  wir  aber  eine  solche  nach  unabhängigem, \r\ngrenzenlosem  geistigen  Wirken  sich  hinsehnende  und  hin- \r\ngetriebene Natur,  wie  sie  durch  die  streng  umfassenden \r\nrömisch-kirchlichen  Bande  sich  wieder  zusammengehalten \r\nfühlen  muß. \r\n\r\nDie  Wirkungen  des  heiligen  Xaverius  unter  den  abgöt- \r\ntischen Heiden  mögen  freilich  damals  in  Rom  großes \r\nAufsehn  gemacht  haben.  Dadurch  aufgeregt,  fühlten  Neri \r\nund  einige  seiner  Freunde  sich  gleichfalls  nach  dem  so- \r\ngenannten Indien  gezogen  und  wünschten  mit  päpstlicher \r\nErlaubnis  sich  dorthin  zu  verfügen.  Allein  der  wahr- \r\nscheinlich von  oben  her  wohl  instruierte  Beichtvater  re- \r\ndete ihnen  ab  und  gab  zu  bedenken,  daß  für  gottselige, \r\nauf  Besserung  des  Nächsten,  auf  Ausbreitung  der  Reli- \r\ngion gerichtete  Männer  in  Rom  selbst  ein  genügsames \r\nIndien  zu  finden  und  ein  würdiger  Schauplatz  für  deren \r\nTätigkeit  offen  sei.  Man  verkündigte  ihnen,  daß  der \r\ngroßen  Stadt  selbst  zunächst  ein  großes  Unheil  bevor- \r\nstehen möchte,  indem  die  drei  Brunnen  vor  dem  Tore \r\nSt.  Sebastian  trüb  und  blutig  seit  einiger  Zeit  geflossen, \r\nwelches  als  eine  untrügliche  Andeutung  zu  betrachten \r\nsei. \r\n\r\nMag  also  der  würdige  Neri  und  seine  Gesellen,  hiedurch \r\nbeschwichtigt,  innerhalb  Roms  ein  wohltätiges  wunder- \r\nwirkendes Leben  fortgesetzt  haben,  so  viel  ist  gewiß,  daß \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  499 \r\n\r\ner  von  Jahr  zu  Jahr  an  Vertrauen  und  Achtung  bei  Großen \r\nund  Kleinen,  Alten  und  Jungen  zugenommen. \r\nBedenke  man  nun  die  wundersame  Komplikation  der \r\nmenschlichen  Natur,  in  welcher  sich  die  stärksten  Ge- \r\ngensätze vereinigen,  Materielles  und  Geistiges,  Gewöhn- \r\nliches und  Unmögliches,  Widerwärtiges  und  Entzückendes. \r\nBeschränktes  und  Grenzenloses,  dergleichen  aufzuführen \r\nman  noch  ein  langes  Register  fortsetzen  könnte;  bedenke \r\nman  einen  solchen  Widerstreit,  wenn  er  in  einem  vor- \r\nzüglichen Menschen  sich  ereignet  und  zutage  tritt,  wie \r\ner  durch  das  Unbegreifliche,  was  sich  aufdringt,  den  Ver- \r\nstand irre  macht,  die  Einbildungskraft  losbindet,  den \r\nGlauben  überflügelt,  den  Aberglauben  berechtigt  und  da- \r\ndurch den  natürlichen  Zustand  mit  dem  unnatürlichsten \r\nin  unmittelbare  Berührung,  ja  zur  Vereinigung  bringt; \r\ngehe  man  mit  diesen  Betrachtungen  an  das  weitläufig \r\nüberlieferte  Leben  unseres  Mannes,  so  wird  es  uns  faß- \r\nlich scheinen,  was  ein  solcher,  der  beinahe  ein  ganzes \r\nJahrhundert  auf  einem  so  großen  Schauplatze  in  einem \r\nUngeheuern  Elemente  ununterbrochen  und  unablässig  ge- \r\nwirkt, für  einen  Einfluß  müsse  erlangt  haben.  Die  hohe \r\nMeinung  von  ihm  ging  so  weit,  daß  man  nicht  allein  von \r\nseinem  gesunden  kräftigen  Wirken  Nutzen,  Heil  und \r\nseliges  Gefühl  sich  zueignete,  sondern  daß  sogar  seine \r\nKrankheiten  das  Vertrauen  vermehrten,  indem  man  sie \r\nals  Zeichen  seines  innigsten  Verhältnisses  zu  Gott  und \r\ndem  Göttlichsten  anzusehen  sich  bewogen  fand.  Hier \r\nbegreifen  wir  nun,  wie  er  schon  lebend  der  Würde  eines \r\nHeiligen  entgegenging  und  sein  Tod  nur  bekräftigen \r\nkonnte,  was  ihm  von  den  Zeitgenossen  zugedacht  und \r\nzugestanden  war. \r\n\r\nDeshalb  auch,  als  man  bald  nach  seinem  Verscheiden, \r\nwelches  von  noch  mehr  Wundern  als  sein  Leben  begleitet \r\nwar,  an  Papst  Clemens  VIII.  die  Frage  brachte,  ob  man \r\nmit  der  Untersuchung — dem  sogenannten  Prozeß,  welcher \r\neiner  Seligsprechung  vorausgeht — den  Anfang  machen \r\ndürfe,  dieser  die  Antwort  erteilte:  Ich  habe  ihn  immer \r\nfür  einen  Heiligen  gehalten  und  kann  daher  nichts  da- \r\ngegen einwenden,  wenn  ihn  die  Kirche  im  allgemeinen \r\n\r\n\r\n5  o  o  ITAIJENISCHE  REISE  II I \r\n\r\nden  Gläubigen  als  solchen  erklären  und  vorstellen \r\nwird. \r\n\r\nNun  aber  dürfte  es  auch  der  Aufmerksamkeit  wert  ge- \r\nhalten werden,  daß  er  in  der  langen  Reihe  von  Jahren, \r\ndie  ihm  zu  wirken  gegönnt  wurden,  fünfzehn  Päpste  er- \r\nlebt, indem  er,  unter  Leo  X.  geboren,  unter  Clemens  VIII. \r\nseine  Tage  beschloß;  daher  er  denn  auch  eine  unab- \r\nhängige Stellung  gegen  den  Papst  selbst  zu  behaupten \r\nsich  anmaßte  und  als  Glied  der  Kirche  sich  zwar  ihren \r\nallgemeinen  Anordnungen  durchaus  gleichstellte,  aber  im \r\neinzelnen  sich  nicht  gebunden,  ja  sogar  gebietrisch  gegen \r\ndas  Oberhaupt  der  Kirche  bewies.  Nun  läßt  es  sich  denn \r\nauch  erklären,  daß  er  die  Kardinalswürde  durchaus  ab- \r\nschlug und  in  seiner  Chiesa  nuova,  gleich  einem  wider- \r\nspenstigen Ritter  in  einer  alten  Burg,  sich  gegen  den \r\nobersten  Schutzherrn  unartig  zu  betragen  herausnahm. \r\nDer  Charakter  jener  Verhältnisse  jedoch,  wie  sie  sich  am \r\nEnde  des  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  aus  den  früheren, \r\nroheren  Zeiten  seltsam  genug  gestaltet  erhielten,  kann \r\ndurch  nichts  deutlicher  vor  Augen  gestellt,  eindringlicher \r\ndem  Geiste  dargebracht  werden  als  durch  ein  Memorial, \r\nwelches  Neri  kurz  vor  seinem  Tode  an  den  neuen  Papst \r\nClemens  VIII.  ergehen  ließ,  worauf  eine  gleich  wunder- \r\nliche Resolution  erfolgte. \r\n\r\nWir  sehen  hieraus  das  auf  eine  andere  Weise  nicht  zu \r\nschildernde  Verhältnis  eines  bald  achtzigjährigen,  dem \r\nRang  eines  Heiligen  entgegengehenden  Mannes  zu  einem \r\nbedeutenden,  tüchtigen,  während  seiner  mehrjährigen \r\nRegierung  höchst  achtbaren  souveränen  Oberhaupte  der \r\nrömisch-katholischen  Kirche. \r\n\r\nMemorial  des  Philipp  Neri  ati  Clemens  VIII. \r\nHeiligster  Vater!  Und  was  für  eine  Person  bin  ich  denn, \r\ndaß  die  Kardinäle  mich  zu  besuchen  kommen,  und  be- \r\nsonders gestern  abend  die  Kardinäle  von  Florenz  und \r\nCusano?  Und  weil  ich  ein  bißchen  Manna  in  Blättern \r\nnötig  hatte,  so  ließ  mir  gedachter  Kardinal  von  Florenz \r\nzwei  Unzen  von  San  Spirito  holen,  indem  der  Herr  Kar- \r\ndinal in  jenes  Hospital  eine  große  Quantität  geschickt \r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPP  NERI  501 \r\n\r\nhatte.  Er  blieb  auch  bis  zwei  Stunden  in  die  Nacht  und \r\nsagte  so  viel  Gutes  von  Ew.  Heiligkeit,  viel  mehr,  als \r\nmir  billig  schien:  denn  da  Sie  Papst  sind,  so  sollten  Sie \r\ndie  Demut  selber  sein.  Christus  kam  um  sieben  Uhr  in \r\nder  Nacht,  sich  mir  einzuverleiben,  und  Ew.  Heiligkeit \r\nkönnte  auch  wohl  einmal  in  unsre  Kirche  kommen. \r\nChristus  ist  Mensch  und  Gott  und  besucht  mich  gar \r\nmanchmal.  Ew.  Heiligkeit  ist  nur  ein  bloßer  Mensch, \r\ngeboren  von  einem  heiligen  und  rechtschaffenen  Mann, \r\njener  aber  von  Gott  Vater.  Die  Mutter  von  Ew.  Heilig- \r\nkeit ist  Signora  Agnesina,  eine  sehr  gottesfürchtige  Dame; \r\naber  jenes  die  Jungfrau  aller  Jungfrauen.  Was  hätte  ich \r\nnicht  alles  zu  sagen,  wenn  ich  meiner  Galle  freien  Lauf \r\nlassen  wollte.  Ich  befehle  Ew.  Heiligkeit,  daß  Sie  mei- \r\nnen Willen  tun,  wegen  eines  Mädchens,  das  ich  nach \r\nTorre  de'  specchi  schaffen  will.  Sie  ist  die  Tochter  von \r\nClaudio  Neri,  dem  Ew.  Heiligkeit  versprochen  hat,  daß \r\nSie  seine  Kinder  beschützen  will,  und  da  erinnere  ich \r\nSie,  daß  es  hübsch  ist,  wenn  ein  Papst  sein  Wort  hält. \r\nDeswegen  übergeben  Sie  mir  gedachtes  Geschäft,  und  so, \r\ndaß  ich  mich  im  Notfall  Ihres  Namens  bedienen  könne; \r\num  so  mehr,  da  ich  den  Willen  des  Mädchens  weiß  und \r\ngewiß  bin,  daß  sie  durch  göttliche  Eingebung  bewegt \r\nwird.  Und  mit  der  größten  Demut,  die  ich  schuldig  bin, \r\nküsse  ich  die  heiligsten  Füße. \r\n\r\nEigenhändige  Resohttion  des  Fapsts,   imter  das  Memorial \r\n\r\ngeschrieben \r\nDer  Papst  sagt,  daß  dieser  Aufsatz  in  seinem  ersten  Teil \r\netwas  vom  Geiste  der  Eitelkeit  enthält,  indem  Er  da- \r\ndurch erfahren  soll,  daß  die  Kardinäle  Dieselben  so  oft \r\nbesuchen;  wenn  uns  nicht  etwa  dadurch  angedeutet  wer- \r\nden soll,  daß  diese  Herren  geistlich  gesinnt  sind,  welches \r\nman  recht  gut  weiß.  Daß  Er  nicht  gekommen  ist,  Die- \r\nselben zu  sehen,  darauf  sagt  Er:  daß  es  Ew.  Ehrwürden \r\nnicht  verdienen,  da  Sie  das  Kardinalat  nicht  haben  an- \r\nnehmen wollen,  das  Ihnen  so  oft  angetragen  worden. \r\nWas  den  Befehl  betrifft,  so  ist  Er  zufrieden,  daß  Die- \r\nselben   mit    Ihrer    gewöhnlichen   Befehlshaberei   denen \r\n\r\n\r\n502  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nguten  Müttern  einen  tüchtigen  Filz  geben,  die  es  Denen- \r\nselben  nicht  nach  Ihrem  Sinne  machen.  Nun  befiehlt  Er \r\nDenselben  aber,  daß  Sie  sich  wahren  und  nicht  Beichte \r\nsitzen  ohne  Seine  Erlaubnis.  Kommt  aber  unser  Herr \r\nDieselben  besuchen,  so  bitten  Sie  für  uns  und  für  die \r\ndringendsten  Notdurften  der  Christenheit. \r\n\r\nJanuar \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  5.  Januar  lySS. \r\n\r\nVERZEIHT,  wenn  ich  heute  nur  wenig  schreibe.  Die- \r\nses Jahr  ist  mit  Ernst  und  Fleiß  angefangen  worden, \r\nund  ich  kann  mich  kaum  umsehen. \r\n\r\nNach  einem  Stillstand  von  einigen  Wochen,  in  denen  ich \r\nmich  leidend  verhielt,  habe  ich  wieder  die  schönsten,  ich \r\ndarf  wohl  sagen,  Offenbarungen.  Es  ist  mir  erlaubt,  Blicke \r\nin  das  Wesen  der  Dinge  und  ihre  Verhältnisse  zu  werfen, \r\ndie  mir  einen  Abgrund  von  Reichtum  eröffnen.  Diese \r\nWirkungen  entstehen  in  meinem  Gemüte,  weil  ich  immer \r\nlerne,  und  zwar  von  andern  lerne.  Wenn  man  sich  selbst \r\nlehrt,  ist  die  arbeitende  und  verarbeitende  Kraft  eins,  und \r\ndie  Vorschritte  müssen  kleiner  und  langsamer  werden. \r\nDas  Studium  des  menschlichen  Körpers  hat  mich  nun \r\nganz.  Alles  andre  verschwindet  dagegen.  Es  ist  mir  da- \r\nmit durch  mein  ganzes  Leben,  auch  jetzt  wieder,  sonder- \r\nbar gegangen.  Darüber  ist  nicht  zu  reden;  was  ich  noch \r\nmachen  werde,  muß  die  Zeit  lehren. \r\nDie  Opern  unterhalten  mich  nicht,  nur  das  innig  und \r\newig  Walire  kann  mich  nun  erfreuen. \r\nEs  spitzt  sich  bis  gegen  Ostern  eine  Epoche  zu,  das  fühl \r\nich;  was  werden  wird,  weiß  ich  nicht. \r\n\r\nDen  10.  Januar. \r\n\r\nErwin  und  Elmire  kommt  mit  diesem  Brief;  möge  dir  das \r\nStückchen  auch  Vergnügen  machen.  Doch  kann  eine \r\nOperette,  wenn  sie  gut  ist,  niemals  im  Lesen  genug  tun; \r\nes  muß  die  Musik  erst  dazu  kommen,  um  den  ganzen  Be- \r\ngriff auszudrücken,  den  der  Dichter  sich  vorstellte.   Clau- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  503 \r\n\r\ndine  kommt  bald  nach.  Beide  Stücke  sind  mehr  gearbei- \r\ntet, als  man  ihnen  ansieht,  weil  ich  erst  recht  mit  Kaysern \r\ndie  Gestalt  des  Singspiels  studiert  habe. \r\nAm  menschlichen  Körper  wird  fleißig  fortgezeichnet,  wie \r\nabends  in  der  Perspektivstunde.  Ich  bereite  mich  zu \r\nmeiner  Auflösung,  damit  ich  mich  ihr  getrosten  Mutes \r\nhingebe,  wenn  die  Himmlischen  sie  auf  Ostern  beschlos- \r\nsen haben.  Es  geschehe,  was  gut  ist! \r\nDas  Interesse  an  der  menschlichen  Gestalt  hebt  nun  alles \r\nandre  auf.  Ich  fühlte  es  wohl  und  wendete  mich  immer \r\ndavon  weg,  wie  man  sich  von  der  blendenden  Sonne  weg- \r\nwendet; auch  ist  alles  vergebens,  was  man  außer  Rom \r\ndarüber  studieren  wiU.  Ohne  einen  Faden,  den  man  nur \r\nhier  spinnen  lernt,  kann  man  sich  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \r\nnicht  herausfinden.  Leider  wird  mein  Faden  nicht  lang  ge- \r\nnug, indessen  hilft  er  mir  doch  durch  die  ersten  Gänge. \r\nWenn  es  mit  Fertigung  meiner  Schriften  unter  gleichen \r\nKonstellationen  fortgeht,  so  muß  ich  mich  im  Laufe  die- \r\nses Jahres  in  eine  Prinzessin  verlieben,  um  den  Tasso, \r\nich  muß  mich  dem  Teufel  ergeben,  um  den  Faust  schrei- \r\nben zu  können,  ob  ich  mir  gleich  zu  beiden  wenig  Lust \r\nfühle.  Denn  bisher  ists  so  gegangen.  Um  mir  selbst \r\nmeinen  Egmont  interessant  zu  machen,  fing  der  römische \r\nKaiser  mit  den  Brabantern  Händel  an,  und  um  meinen \r\nOpern  einen  Grad  von  Vollkommenheit  zu  geben,  kam \r\nder  Züricher  Kayser  nach  Rom.  Das  heißt  doch  ein  vor- \r\nnehvier  Rönier^  wie  Herder  sagt,  und  ich  finde  es  recht \r\nlustig,  eine  Endursache  der  Handlungen  und  Begeben- \r\nheiten zu  werden,  welche  gar  nicht  auf  mich  gerichtet \r\nsind.  Das  darf  man  Glück  nennen.  Also  die  Prinzessin \r\nund  den  Teufel  wollen  wir  in  Geduld  abwarten. \r\n\r\nHier  kommt  aus  Rom  abermals  ein  Pröbchen  deutscher \r\nArt  und  Kunst,  Erwin  und  Elmire.  Es  ward  eher  fertig \r\nals  Claudine,  doch  wünsch  ich  nicht,  daß  es  zuerst  ge- \r\ndruckt werde. \r\n\r\nDu  wirst  bald  sehen,  daß  alles  aufs  Bedürfnis  der  lyri- \r\nschen Bühne  gerechnet  ist,  das  ich  erst  hier  zu  studieren \r\nGelegenheit  hatte:  alle  Personen  in  einer  gewissen  Folge, \r\n\r\n\r\n504  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nin  einem  gewissen  Maß  zu  beschäftigen,  daß  jeder  Sän- \r\nger Ruhpunkte  genug  habe  usw.  Es  sind  hundert  Dinge \r\nzu  beobachten,  welchen  der  Italiener  allen  Sinn  des  Ge- \r\ndichts aufopfert;  ich  wünsche,  daß  es  mir  gelungen  sein \r\nmöge,  jene  musikalisch-theatralischen  Erfordernisse  durch \r\nein  Stückchen  zu  befriedigen,  das  nicht  ganz  unsinnig  ist. \r\nIch  hatte  noch  die  Rücksicht,  daß  sich  beide  Operetten \r\ndoch  auch  müssen  lesen  lassen,  daß  sie  ihrem  Nachbar \r\nEgmont  keine  Schande  machten.  Ein  italienisch  Opern- \r\nbüchelchen  liest  kein  Mensch  als  am  Abend  der  Vor- \r\nstellung, und  es  in  einen  Band  mit  einem  Trauer- \r\nspiel zu  bringen,  würde  hier  zu  Lande  für  ebenso  un- \r\nmöglich gehalten  werden,  als  daß  man  deutsch  singen \r\nkönne. \r\n\r\nBei  Erwin  muß  ich  noch  bemerken,  daß  du  das  trochä- \r\nische Silbenmaß,  besonders  im  zweiten  Akt,  öfter  finden \r\nwirst;  es  ist  nicht  Zufall  oder  Gewohnheit,  sondern  aus \r\nitalienischen  Beispielen  genommen.  Dieses  Silbenmaß \r\nist  zur  Musik  vorzüglich  glücklich,  und  der  Komponist \r\nkann  es  durch  mehrere  Takt-  und  Bewegungsarten  der- \r\ngestalt variieren,  daß  es  der  Zuhörer  nie  wiedererkennt; \r\nwie  überhaupt  die  Italiener  auf  glatte,  einfache  Silben- \r\nmaße und  Rhythmen  ausschließlich  halten. \r\nDer  junge  Camper  ist  ein  Strudelkopf,  der  viel  weiß, \r\nleicht  begreift  und  über  die  Sachen  hinfährt. \r\nGlück  zum  vierten  Teil  der  \"Ideen.\"  Der  dritte  ist  uns  ein \r\nheilig  Buch,  das  ich  verschlossen  halte;  erst  jetzt  hat  es \r\nMoritz  zu  lesen  gekriegt,  der  sich  glücklich  preist,  daß  er \r\nin  dieser  Epoche  der  Erziehung  des  Menschengeschlechts \r\nlebt.  Er  hat  das  Buch  recht  gut  gefühlt  und  war  über  das \r\nEnde  ganz  außer  sich. \r\n\r\nWenn  ich  dich  nur  einmal  für  alle  das  Gute  auf  dem \r\nKapitol  bewirten  könnte !  Es  ist  einer  meiner  angelegen- \r\nsten Wünsche. \r\n\r\nMeine  titanischen  Ideen  waren  nur  Luftgestalten,  die  einer \r\nernsteren  Epoche  vorspukten.  Ich  bin  nun  recht  im  Stu- \r\ndio der  Menschengestalt,  welche  das  non  plus  ultra  alles \r\nmenschlichen  Wissens  und  Tuns  ist.  Meine  fleißige  Vor- \r\nbereitung im  Studio  der  ganzen   Natur,  besonders  die \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  17  88  505 \r\n\r\nüsteologie,  hilft  nur  starke  Schritte  machen.  Jetzt  seh \r\nich,  jetzt  genieß  ich  erst  das  Höchste,  was  uns  vom  Al- \r\ntertum übrig  blieb,  die  Statuen.  Ja,  ich  sehe  wohl  ein, \r\ndaß  man  ein  ganzes  Leben  studieren  kann,  und  am  Ende \r\ndoch  noch  ausrufen  möchte:  Jetzt  seh  ich,  jetzt  genieß \r\nich  erst. \r\n\r\nIch  raffe  alles  mögliche  zusammen,  um  Ostern  eme  ge- \r\nwisse Epoche,  wohin  mein  Auge  nun  reicht,  zu  schließen, \r\ndamit  ich  Rom  nicht  mit  entschiedenemWiderwillen  ver- \r\nlasse, und  hoffe  in  Deutschland  einige  Studien  bequem \r\nund  gründlich  fortsetzen  zu  können,  obgleich  langsam  ge- \r\nnug. Hier  trägt  einen  der  Strom  fort,  sobald  man  nur \r\ndas  Schifflein  bestiegen  hat. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\nJanuar \r\n\r\nCupido,  loser,  eigensinniger  Knabe, \r\n\r\nDu  batst  mich  um  Quartier  auf  einige  Stunden! \r\n\r\nWie  viele  Tag  und  Nächte  bist  du  geblieben. \r\n\r\nUnd  bist  nun  herrisch  und  Meister  im  Hause  geworden. \r\n\r\nVon  meinem  breiten  Lager  bin  ich  vercrieben, \r\n\r\nNun  sitz  ich  an  der  Erde,  Nächte  gequälet; \r\n\r\nDein  Mutwill  schüret  Flamm  auf  Flamme  des  Herdes, \r\n\r\nVerbrennet  den  Vorrat  des  Winters  und  senget  mich  Armen. \r\n\r\nDu  hast  mir  mein  Gerät  verstellt  und  verschoben. \r\nIch  such  und  bin  wie  blind  und  irre  geworden. \r\nDu  lärmst  so  ungeschickt;  ich  fürchte,  das  Seelchen \r\nEntflieht  um  dir  zu  entfliehn,  und  räumet  die  Hütte. \r\n\r\n\r\nWenn  man  vorstehendes  Liedchen  nicht  in  buchstäb- \r\nlichem Sinne  nehmen,  nicht  jenen  Dämon,  den  man  ge- \r\nwöhnlich Amor  nennt,  dabei  denken,  sondern  eine  Ver- \r\nsammlung tätiger  Geister  sich  vorstellen  will,  die  das \r\nInnerste  des  Menschen  ansprechen,  auffordern,  hin  und \r\nwider  ziehen  und  durch  geteiltes  Interesse  verwirren,  so \r\n\r\n\r\n5o6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nwird  man  auf  eine  symbolische  Weise  an  dem  Zustande \r\nteilnehmen,  in  dem  ich  mich  befand  und  welchen  die \r\nAuszüge  aus  Briefen  und  die  bisherigen  Erzählungen  ge- \r\nnugsam darstellen.  Man  wird  zugestehen,  daß  eine  große \r\nAnstrengung  gefordert  ward,  sich  gegen  so  vieles  auf- \r\nrecht zu  erhalten,  in  Tätigkeit  nicht  zu  ermüden  und  im \r\nAufnehmen  nicht  lässig  zu  werden. \r\n\r\nAiifnaJwic  in  die  Gesellschaft  der  Arkadier \r\nSchon  zu  Ende  des  vorigen  Jahrs  ward  ich  mit  einem \r\nyVntrage  bestürmt,  den  ich  auch  als  Folge  jenes  unseligen \r\nKonzertes  ansah,  durch  welches  wir  unser  Inkognito  leicht- \r\nsinnigerweise enthüllt  hatten.  Es  konnte  jedoch  andere  An- \r\nlässe haben,  daß  man  von  mehreren  Seiten  her  mich  zu \r\nbestimmen  suchte,  mich  in  die  Arcadia  als  einen  nam- \r\nhaften Schäfer  aufnehmen  zu  lassen.  Lange  widerstand \r\nich,  mußte  jedoch  zuletzt  den  Freunden,  die  hierein  et- \r\nwas Besonderes  zu  setzen  schienen,  endlich  nachgeben. \r\nIm  allgemeinen  ist  bekannt,  was  unter  dieser  arkadischen \r\nGesellschaft  verstanden  wird;  doch  ist  es  wohl  nicht  un- \r\nangenehm, etwas  darüber  zu  vernehmen. \r\nWährend  dem  Laufe  des  siebzehnten  Jahrhunderts  mag \r\ndie  italienische  Foesie  sich  auf  mancherlei  Weise  ver- \r\nschlimmert haben;  denn  gegen  Ende  dieses  Zeitraums \r\nwerfen  ihr  gebildete,  wohlgesinnte  Männer  vor,  sie  habe \r\nden  Gehalt,  was  man  damals  innere  Schönheit  nannte, \r\nvöllig  versäumt;  auch  sei  sie  in  Absicht  auf  die  Form, \r\ntlie  äußere  Schönheit,  durchaus  zu  tadeln;  denn  sie  habe \r\nmit  barbarischen  Ausdrücken,  unleidlich  harten  Versen, \r\nfehlerhaften  Figuren  und  Tropen,  besonders  mit  fortlaufen- \r\nden und  un<j-emessenen  Hyperbeln,  Metonymien  und  Meta- \r\nphern, auch  ganz  und  gar  das  Anmutige  und  Süße  ver- \r\nscherzt, welches  man  am  Äußern  zu  schätzen  sich  erfreue. \r\nJene  auf  solchen  Irrwegen  Befangenen  jedoch  schalten, \r\nwie  es  zu  gehen  pflegt,  das  Echte  und  Fürtreftliche,  da- \r\nmit ihre  Mißbräuche  fernerhin  unangetastet  gelten  möch- \r\nten. Welches  denn  doch  zuletzt  von  gebildeten  und  ver- \r\nständigen Menschen  nicht  mehr  erduldet  werden  konnte, \r\ndergestalt,  daß  im  Jahr  1690   eine  Anzahl  umsichtiger \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  507 \r\n\r\nund  kräftiger  Männer  zusammentrat  und  einen  aTidern \r\nWeg  einzuschlagen  sich  beredete. \r\n\r\nDamit  aber  ihre  Zusammenkünfte  glicht  Aufsehn  machen \r\nund  Gegenwirkung  veranlassen  möchten,  so  wendeten \r\nsie  sich  ins  Freie,  in  ländliche  Gartenumgebungen,  deren \r\nja  Rom  selbst  in  seinen  Mauern  genügsame  bezirkt  und \r\neinschließt.  Hiedurch  ward  ihnen  zugleich  der  Gewinn, \r\nsich  der  Natur  zu  nähern  und  in  frischer  Luft  den  uran- \r\nfänglichen Geist  der  Dichtkunst  zu  ahnen.  Dort,  an  zu- \r\nfälligen Plätzen,  lagerten  sie  sich  auf  dem  Rasen,  setzten \r\nsich  auf  architektonische  Trümmer  und  Steinblöcke,  wo \r\nsogar  anwesende  Kardinäle  nur  durch  ein  weicheres  Kis- \r\nsen geehrt  werden  konnten.  Hier  besprachen  sie  sich \r\nuntereinander  von  ihren  Überzeugungen,  Grundsätzen, \r\nVorhaben;  hier  lasen  sie  Gedichte,  in  welchen  man  den \r\nSinn  des  höheren  Altertums,  der  edlen  toskanischen  Schule \r\nwieder  ins  Leben  zu  führen  trachtete.  Da  rief  denn  einer \r\nin  Entzücken  aus:  Hier  ist  unser  Arkadien!  Dies  veran- \r\nlaßte  den  Namen  der  Gesellschaft,  sowie  das  Idyllische \r\nihrer  Einrichtung.  Keine  Protektion  eines  großen  und \r\neinflußreichen  Mannes  sollte  sie  schützen;  sie  wollten \r\nkein  Oberhaupt,  keinen  Präsidenten  zugeben.  Ein  Kustos \r\nsollte  die  arkadischen  Räume  öffnen  und  schließen  und \r\nin  den  notwendigsten  Fällen  ihm  ein  Rat  von  zu  wählen- \r\nden Ältesten  zur  Seite  stehn. \r\n\r\nHier  ist  der  Name  Crescimbeni  ehrwürdig,  welcher  gar \r\nwohl  als  Mitstifter  angesehen  werden  kann  und  als  erster \r\nKustos  sein  Amt  mehrere  Jahre  treulich  verrichtet,  indem \r\ner  über  einen  bessern,  reinern  Geschmack  Wache  hält \r\nund  das  Barbarische  immer  mehr  zu  verdrängen  weiß. \r\nSeine  Dialogen  über  die  Poesia  volgare,  welches  nicht \r\netwa  Volkspoesie  zu  übersetzen  ist,  sondern  Poesie,  wie \r\nsie  einer  Nation  wohl  ansteht,  wenn  sie  durch  entschie- \r\ndene wahre  Talente  ausgeübt,  nicht  aber  durch  Grillen \r\nund  Eigenheiten  einzelner  Wirrköpfe  entstellt  wird,  seine \r\nDialogen,  worin  er  die  bessere  Lehre  vorträgt,  sind  offen- \r\nbar eine  Frucht  arkadischer  LTnterhaltungen  und  höchst \r\nwichtig  in  Vergleich  mit  unserm  neuen  ästhetischen  Be- \r\nstreben.    Auch  die  von  ihm  herausgegebenen  Gedichte \r\n\r\n\r\n5o8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  HI \r\n\r\nder  Arcadia  verdienen  in  diesem  Sinne  alle  Aufmerksam- \r\nkeit; wir  erlauben  uns  dabei  nur  folgende  Bemerkung. \r\nZwar  hatten  die  werten  Schäfer,  im  Freien  auf  grünem \r\nRasen  sich  lagernd,  der  Natur  hiedurch  näher  zu  kom- \r\nmen gedacht,  in  welchem  Falle  wohl  Liebe  und  Leiden- \r\nschaft ein  menschlich  Herz  zu  überschleichen  pflegt;  nun \r\naber  bestand  die  Gesellschaft  aus  geistlichen  Herren  und \r\nsonstigen  würdigen  Personen,  die  sich  mit  dem  Amor \r\njener  römischen  Triumvirn  nicht  einlassen  durften,  den \r\nsie  deshalb  ausdrücklich  beseitigten.  Hier  also  blieb  nichts \r\nübrig,  da  dem  Dichter  die  Liebe  ganz  unentbehrlich  ist, \r\nals  sich  zu  jener  überirdischen  und  gewissermaßen  pla- \r\ntonischen Sehnsucht  hinzuwenden,  nicht  weniger  ins  Alle- \r\ngorische sich  einzulassen,  wodurch  denn  ihre  Gedichte \r\neinen  ganz  ehrsamen,  eigentümlichen  Charakter  erhalten, \r\nda  sie  ohnehin  ihren  großen  Vorgängern  Dante  und  Pe- \r\ntrarch  hierin  auf  dem  Fuße  folgen  konnten. \r\nDiese  Gesellschaft  bestand,  wie  ich  nach  Rom  gelangte, \r\nsoeben  hundert  Jahr  und  hatte  sich,  ihrer  äußern  Form \r\nnach,  durch  mancherlei  Orts-  und  Gesinnungswechsel \r\nimmer  mit  Anstand,  wenn  auch  nicht  in  großem  Ansehn \r\nerhalten;  und  man  ließ  nicht  leicht  einigermaßen  bedeu- \r\ntende Fremde  in  Rom  verweilen,  ohne  dieselben  zur  Auf- \r\nnahme anzulocken,  um  so  mehr,  als  der  Hüter  dieser \r\npoetischen  Ländereien  bloß  dadurch  sich  bei  einem  mä- \r\nßigen Einkommen  erhalten  konnte. \r\n\r\nDie  Funktion  selbst  aber  ging  folgendermaßen  vor  sich. \r\nIn  den  Vorzimmern  eines  anständigen  Gebäudes  ward  ich \r\neinem  bedeutenden  geistlichen  Herrn  vorgestellt  und  er \r\nmir  bekannt  gemacht  als  derjenige,  der  mich  einführen, \r\nmeinen  Bürgen  gleichsam  oder  Paten  vorstellen  sollte. \r\nWir  traten  in  einen  großen,  bereits  ziemlich  belebten  Saal \r\nund  setzten  uns  in  die  erste  Reihe  von  Stühlen,  gerade \r\nin  die  Mitte  einem  aufgerichteten  Katheder  gegenüber. \r\nEs  traten  immer  mehr  Zuhörer  heran;  au  meine  leerge- \r\nbliebene Rechte  fand  sich  ein  stattlicher  ältlicher  Mann, \r\nden  ich  nach  seiner  Bekleidung  und  der  Ehrfurcht,  die \r\nman  ihm  erwies,  für  einen  Kardinal  zu  halten  hatte. \r\nDer  Kustode,  vom  Katheder  herab,  hielt  eine  allgemein \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  509 \r\n\r\neinleitende  Rede,  rief  mehrere  Personen  auf,  welche  sich \r\nteils  in  Versen,  teils  in  Prosa  hören  ließen.  Nachdem \r\ndieses  eine  gute  Zeit  gewährt,  begann  jener  eine  Rede, \r\nderen  Inhalt  und  Ausführung  ich  übergehe,  indem  sie  im \r\nganzen  mit  dem  Diplom  zusammentraf,  welches  ich  erhielt \r\nund  hier  nachzubringen  gedenke.  Hierauf  wurde  ich  denn \r\nförmlich  für  einen  der  Ihrigen  erklärt  und  unter  großem \r\nHändeklatschen  aufgenommen  und  anerkannt. \r\nMein  sogenannter  Pate  und  ich  waren  indessen  aufge- \r\nstanden und  hatten  uns  mit  vielen  Verbeugungen  be- \r\ndankt. Er  aber  hielt  eine  wohlgedachte,  nicht  allzulange, \r\nsehr  schickliche  Rede,  worauf  abermals  ein  allgemeiner \r\nBeifall  sich  hören  ließ,  nach  dessen  Verschallen  ich  Ge- \r\nlegenheit hatte,  den  einzelnen  zu  danken  und  mich  ihnen \r\nzu  empfehlen.  Das  Diplom,  welches  ich  den  andern  Tag \r\nerhielt,  folgt  hier  im  Original  und  ist,  da  es  in  jeder  an- \r\ndern Sprache  seine  Eigentümlichkeit  verlöre,  nicht  über- \r\nsetzt worden.  Indessen  suchte  ich  den  Kustode  mit  sei- \r\nnem neuen  Hutgenossen  auf  das  beste  zufrieden  zu \r\nstellen. \r\n\r\nC.  U.

Egireo     J \r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL \r\n\r\nINDEM  wir  eine  Beschreibung  des  römischen  Karnevals \r\nunternehmen,  müssen  wir  den  Einwurf  befürchten,  daß \r\neine  solche  Feierlichkeit  eigentlich  nicht  beschrieben \r\nwerden  könne.  Eine  so  große,  lebendige  Masse  sinn- \r\nlicher Gegenstände  sollte  sich  unmittelbar  vor  dem  Auge \r\nbewegen  und  von  einem  jeden  nach  seiner  Art  ange- \r\nschaut und  gefaßt  werden. \r\n\r\nNoch  bedenklicher  wird  diese  Einwendung,  wenn  wir \r\nselbst  gestehen  müssen,  daß  das  römische  Karneval  einem \r\nfremden  Zuschauer,  der  es  zum  erstenmal  sieht  und  nur \r\nse/icn  will  und  kann,  weder  einen  ganzen  noch  einen \r\nerfreulichen  Eindruck  gebe,  weder  das  Auge  sonderlich \r\nergötze  noch  das  Gemüt  befriedige. \r\nDie  lange  und  schmale  Straße,  in  welcher  sich  unzählige \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  ROMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5 1 1 \r\n\r\nMenschen  hin  und  wider  wälzen,  ist  nicht  zu  übersehen; \r\nkaum  unterscheidet  man  etwas  in  dem  Bezirk  des  Ge- \r\ntümmels, den  das  Auge  fassen  kann.  Die  Bewegung  ist \r\neinförmig,  der  Lärm  betäubend,  das  Ende  der  Tage  un- \r\nbefriedigend. Allein  diese  Bedenklichkeiten  sind  bald \r\ngehoben,  wenn  wir  uns  näher  erklären;  und  vorzüglich \r\nwird  die  Frage  sein,  ob  uns  die  Beschreibung  selbst \r\nrechtfertigt. \r\n\r\nDas  römische  Karneval  ist  ein  Fest,  das  dem  Volke \r\neigentlich  nicht  gegeben  wird,  sondern  das  sich  das  Volk \r\nselbst  gibt. \r\n\r\nDer  Staat  macht  wenig  Anstalten,  wenig  Aufwand  dazu. \r\nDer  Kreis  der  Freuden  bewegt  sich  von  selbst,  und  die \r\nPolizei  regiert  ihn  nur  mit  gelinder  Hand. \r\nHier  ist  nicht  ein  Fest,  das  wie  die  vielen  geistlichen \r\nFeste  Roms  die  Augen  der  Zuschauer  blendete;  hier  ist \r\nkein  Feuerwerk,  das  von  dem  Kastell  Sant'  Angelo  einen \r\neinzigen  überraschenden  Anblick  gewährte;  hier  ist  keine \r\nErleuchtung  der  Peterskirche  und  -kuppel,  welche  so \r\nviel  Fremde  aus  allen  Landen  herbeilockt  und  befriedigt; \r\nhier  ist  keine  glänzende  Prozession,  bei  deren  Annähe- \r\nrung das  Volk  beten  und  staunen  soll:  hier  wird  vielmehr \r\nnur  ein  Zeichen  gegeben,  daß  jeder  so  töricht  und  toll \r\nsein  dürfe,  als  er  wolle,  und  daß  außer  Schlägen  und \r\nMesserstichen  fast  alles  erlaubt  sei. \r\nDer  Unterschied  zwischen  Hohen  und  Niedern  scheint \r\neinen  Augenblick  aufgehoben:  alles  nähert  sich  einander, \r\njeder  nimmt,  was  ihm  begegnet,  leicht  auf,  und  die \r\nwechselseitige  Frechheit  und  Freiheit  wird  durch  eine \r\nallgemeine  gute  Laune  im  Gleichgewicht  erhalten. \r\nIn  diesen  Tagen  freuet  sich  der  Römer  noch  zu  unsern \r\nZeiten,  daß  die  Geburt  Christi  das  Fest  der  Saturnalien \r\nund  seiner  Privilegien  wohl  um  einige  Wochen  verschie- \r\nben, aber  nicht  aufheben  konnte. \r\n\r\nWir  werden  uns  bemühen,  die  Freuden  und  den  Taumel \r\ndieser  Tage  vor  die  Einbildungskraft  unserer  Leser  zu \r\nbringen.  Auch  schmeicheln  wir  uns,  solchen  Personen  zu \r\ndienen,  welche  dem  römischen  Karneval  selbst  einmal \r\nbeigewohnt  und  sich  nun  mit  einer  lebhaften  Erinnerung \r\n\r\n\r\n5 1 2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\njener  Zeiten  vergnügen  mögen,  nicht  weniger  solchen, \r\nwelchen  jene  Reise  noch  bevorsteht  und  denen  diese \r\nwenigen  Blätter  Übersicht  und  Genuß  einer  überdrängten \r\nund  vorbeirauschenden  Freude  verschaffen  können. \r\n\r\nDer  Corso \r\n\r\nDas  römische  Karneval  versammelt  sich  in  dem  Corso. \r\nDiese  Straße  beschränkt  und  bestimmt  die  öffentliche \r\nFeierlichkeit  dieser  Tage.  An  jedem  andern  Platz  würde \r\nes  ein  ander  Fest  sein;  und  wir  haben  daher  vor  allen \r\nDingen  den  Corso  zu  beschreiben. \r\n\r\nEr  führt  den  Namen,  wie  mehrere  lange  Straßen  italieni- \r\nscher Städte,  von  dem  Wettrennen  der  Pferde,  womit  zu \r\nRom  sich  jeder  Karnevalsabend  schließt,  und  womit  an \r\nandern  Orten  andere  Feierlichkeiten,  als  das  Fest  eines \r\nSchutzpatrons,  ein  Kirchweihfest,  geendigt  werden. \r\nDie  Straße  geht  von  der  Piazza  del  Popolo  schnurgerade \r\nbis  an  den  Venezianischen  Palast.  Sie  ist  ungefähr  vierte- \r\nhalbtausend  Schritte  lang  und  von  hohen,  meistenteils \r\nprächtigen  Gebäuden  eingefaßt.  Ihre  Breite  ist  gegen \r\nihre  Länge  und  gegen  die  Höhe  der  Gebäude  nicht  ver- \r\nhältnismäßig. An  beiden  Seiten  nehmen  Pflastererhöhun- \r\ngen für  die  Fußgänger  ungefähr  sechs  bis  acht  Fuß  weg. \r\nIn  der  Mitte  bleibt  für  die  Wagen  an  den  meisten  Orten \r\nnur  der  Raum  von  zwölf  bis  vierzehn  Schritten,  und  man \r\nsieht  also  leicht,  daß  höchstens  drei  Fuhrwerke  sich  in \r\ndieser  Breite  nebeneinander  bewegen  können. \r\nDer  Obelisk  auf  der  Piazza  del  Popolo  ist  im  Karneval  die \r\nunterste  Grenze  dieser  Straße,  der  Venezianische  Palast \r\ndie  obere. \r\n\r\nSpazierfahrt  im  Corso \r\n\r\nSchon  alle  Sonn-  und  Festtage  eines  Jahres  ist  der  rö- \r\nmische Corso  belebt.  Die  vornehmern  und  reichern  Rö- \r\nmern fahren  hier  eine  oder  anderthalb  Stunden  vor  Nacht \r\nin  einer  sehr  zahlreichen  Reihe  spazieren:  die  Wagen \r\nkommen  vom  Venezianischen  Palast  herunter,  halten  sich \r\nan  der  linken  Seite,  fahren,  wenn  es  schön  Wetter  ist,  an \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  513 \r\n\r\ndem  Obelisk  vorbei,  zum  Tore  hinaus  und  auf  den  Fla- \r\nminischen Weg,  manchmal  bis  Ponte  molle. \r\nDie  früher  oder  später  Umkehrenden  halten  sich  an  die \r\nandere  Seite;  so  ziehen  die  beiden  Wagenreihen  in  der \r\nbesten  Ordnung  aneinander  hin. \r\n\r\nDie  Gesandten  haben  das  Recht,  zwischen  beiden  Reihen \r\nauf  und  nieder  zu  fahren;  dem  Prätendenten,  der  sich  un- \r\nter dem  Namen  eines  Herzogs  von  Albanien  in  Rom  auf- \r\nhielt, war  es  gleichfalls  zugestanden. \r\nSobald  die  Nacht  eingeläutet  wird,  ist  diese  Ordnung  un- \r\nterbrochen: jeder  wendet,  wo  es  ihm  beliebt,  und  sucht \r\nseinen  nächsten  Weg,  oft  zur  Unbequemlichkeit  vieler  an- \r\ndern Equipagen,  welche  in  dem  engen  Raum  dadurch  ge- \r\nhindert und  aufgehalten  werden. \r\n\r\nDiese  Abendspazierfahrt,  welche  in  allen  großen  italie- \r\nnischen Städten  brillant  ist  und  in  jeder  kleinen  Stadt, \r\nwäre  es  auch  nur  mit  einigen  Kutschen,  nachgeahmt  wird, \r\nlockt  viele  Fußgänger  in  den  Corso;  jedermann  kommt, \r\num  zu  sehen  oder  gesehen  zu  werden. \r\nDas  Karneval  ist,  wie  wir  bald  bemerken  können,  eigent- \r\nlich nur  eine  Fortsetzung  oder  vielmehr  der  Gipfel  jener \r\ngewöhnlichen  sonn-  und  festtägigen  Freuden;  es  ist \r\nnichts  Neues,  nichts  Fremdes,  nichts  Einziges,  sondern \r\nes  schließt  sich  nur  an  die  römische  Lebensweise  ganz \r\nnatürlich  an. \r\n\r\nKlima,  geistliche  Kleidungen \r\n\r\nEbenso  wenig  fremd  wird  es  uns  scheinen,  wenn  wir  nun \r\nbald  eine  Menge  Masken  in  freier  Luft  sehen,  da  wir  so \r\nmanche  Lebensszene  unter  dem  heitern  frohen  Himmel \r\ndas  ganze  Jahr  durch  zu  erblicken  gewohnt  sind. \r\nBei  einem  jeden  Feste  bilden  ausgehängte  Teppiche,  ge- \r\nstreute Blumen,  übergespannte  Tücher  die  Straßen  gleich- \r\nsam zu  großen  Sälen  und  Galerien  um. \r\nKeine  Leiche  wird  ohne  vermummte  Begleitung  der  Brü- \r\nderschaften zu  Grabe  gebracht;  die  vielen  Mönchsklei- \r\ndungen gewöhnen  das  Auge  an  fremde  und  sonderbare \r\nGestalten:  es  scheint  das  ganze  Jahr  Karneval  zu  sein, \r\nund  die  Abbaten  in  schwarzer  Kleidung  scheinen  unter \r\n\r\nGOETHE  W  33 \r\n\r\n\r\n5 1 4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nden  übrigen  geistlichen  Masken  die  edlern  Tabarros  vor- \r\nzustellen. \r\n\r\nErste  Zeit \r\nSchon  von  dem  neuen  Jahre  an  sind  die  Schauspielhäuser \r\neröfifnet  und  das  Karneval  hat  seinen  Anfang  genommen. \r\nMan  sieht  hie  und  da  in  den  Logen  eine  Schöne,  welche \r\nals  Offizier  ihre  Epauletten  mit  größter  Selbstzufriedenheit \r\ndem  Volke  zeigt.  Die  Spazierfahrt  im  Corso  wird  zahl- \r\nreicher; doch  die  allgemeine  Erwartung  ist  auf  die  letzten \r\nacht  Tage  gerichtet. \r\n\r\nVorbereitungen  auf  die  letzten  Tage \r\nMancherlei  Vorbereitungen  verkündigen  dem  Publikum \r\ndiese  paradiesischen  Stunden. \r\n\r\nDer  Corso,  eine  von  den  wenigen  Straßen  in  Rom,  welche \r\ndas  ganze  Jahr  rein  gehalten  werden,  wird  nun  sorgfäl- \r\ntiger gekehrt  und  gereiniget.  Man  ist  beschäftigt,  das \r\nschöne,  aus  kleinen,  viereckig  zugehauenen, ziemlich  glei- \r\nchen Basaltstücken  zusammengesetzte  Pflaster,  wo  es  nur \r\neinigermaßen  abzuweichen  scheint,  auszuheben  und  die \r\nBasaltkeile  wieder  neu  instand  zu  setzen. \r\nAußer  diesem  zeigen  sich  auch  lebendige  Vorboten.  Jeder \r\nKarnevalsabend  schließt  sich,  wie  wir  schon  erwähnt  ha- \r\nben, mit  einem  Wettrennen.  Die  Pferde,  welche  man  zu \r\ndiesem  Endzweck  unterhält,  sind  meistenteils  klein  und \r\nwerden  wegen  fremder  Herkunft  der  besten  unter  ihnen \r\nBarberi  genennt. \r\n\r\nEin  solches  Pferdchen  wird  mit  einer  Decke  von  weißer \r\nLeinwand,  welche  am  Kopf,  Hals  und  Leib  genau  an- \r\nschließt und  auf  den  Nähten  mit  l^unten  Bändern  besetzt \r\nist,  vor  dem  Obelisk  an  die  Stelle  gebracht,  wo  es  in  der \r\nFolge  auslaufen  soll.  Man  gewöhnt  es,  den  Kopf  gegen \r\nden  Corso  gerichtet,  eine  Zeitlang  still  zu  stehen,  führt \r\nes  alsdann  sachte  die  Straße  hin  und  gibt  ihm  oben  am \r\nVenezianischen  Palast  ein  wenig  Hafer,  damit  es  ein  In- \r\nteresse empfinde,  seine  Bahn  desto  geschwinder  zu  durch- \r\nlaufen. \r\nDa  diese  Übung  mit  den  meisten  Pferden,  deren  oft  fünf- \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5 1 5 \r\n\r\nzehn  bis  zwanzig  an  der  Zahl  sind,  wiederholt  und  eine \r\nsolche  Promenade  immer  von  einer  Anzahl  lustig  schrei- \r\nender Knaben  begleitet  wird,  so  gibt  es  schon  einen  Vor- \r\nschmack  von  einem  größern  Lärm  und  Jubel ,  der  bald \r\nfolgen  soll. \r\n\r\nEhemals  nährten  die  ersten  römischenHäuser  dergleichen \r\nPferde  in  ihren  Marställen;  man  schätzte  sich  es  zur  Ehre, \r\nwenn  ein  solches  den  Preis  davontragen  konnte.  Es  wur- \r\nden Wetten  angestellt  und  der  Sieg  durch  ein  Gastmahl \r\nverherrlicht.  In  den  letzten  Zeiten  hingegen  hat  diese \r\nLiebhaberei  sehr  abgenommen,  und  der  Wunsch,  durch \r\nseine  Pferde  Ruhm  zu  erlangen,  ist  in  die  mittlere,  ja  in \r\ndie  unterste  Klasse  des  Volks  herabgestiegen. \r\nAus  jenen  Zeiten  mag  sich  noch  die  Gewohnheit  her- \r\nschreiben, daß  der  Trupp  Reiter,  welcher,  von  Trompe- \r\ntern begleitet,  in  diesen  Tagen  die  Preise  in  ganz  Rom \r\nherumzeigt,  in  die  Häuser  der  Vornehmen  hineinreitet \r\nundnach  einem  geblasenen  Trompeterstückchen  einTrink- \r\ngeld empfängt. \r\n\r\nDer  Preis  bestehet  aus  einem  etwa  drittehalb  Ellen  langen \r\nund  nicht  gar  eine  Elle  breiten  Stück  Gold-  oder  Silber- \r\nstoff, das  an  einer  bunten  Stange  wie  eine  Flagge  befe- \r\nstigt schwebt  und  an  dessen  unterm  Ende  das  Bild  einiger \r\nrennenden  Pferde  quer  eingewirkt  ist. \r\nEs  wird  dieser  Preis  Palio  genannt,  und  so  viel  Tage \r\ndas  Karneval  dauert,  so  viele  solcher  Quasi -Standarten \r\nwerden  von  dem  ersterwähnten  Zug  durch  die  Straßen \r\nvon  Rom  aufgezeigt. \r\n\r\nInzwischen  fängt  auch  der  Corso  an,  seine  Gestalt  zu  ver- \r\nändern; der  Obelisk  wird  nun  die  Grenze  der  Straße.  Vor \r\ndemselben  wird  ein  Gerüste  mit  vielen  Sitzreihen  über- \r\neinander aufgeschlagen ,  welches  gerade  in  den  Corso \r\nhineinsieht.  Vor  dem  Gerüste  werden  die  Schranken  er- \r\nrichtet, zwischen  welche  man  künftig  die  Pferde  zum  Ab- \r\nlaufen bringen  soll. \r\n\r\nAn  beiden  Seiten  werden  ferner  große  Gerüste  gebaut, \r\nwelche  sich  an  die  ersten  Häuser  des  Corso  anschließen \r\nund  auf  diese  W^eise  die  Straße  in  den  Platz  herein  ver- \r\nläncfern.    An  beiden  Seiten  der  Schranken  stehen  kleine. \r\n\r\n\r\n5 1 6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nerhöhte  und  bedeckte  Bogen  für  die  Personen,  welche  das \r\nAblaufen  der  Pferde  regulieren  sollen. \r\nDen  Corso  hinauf  sieht  man  vor  manchen  Häusern  eben- \r\nfalls Gerüste  aufgerichtet.  Die  Plätze  von  San  Carlo  und \r\nder  Antoninischen  Säule  werden  durch  Schranken  von  der \r\nStraße  abgesondert,  und  alles  bezeichnet  genug,  daß  die \r\nganze  Feierlichkeit  sich  indem  langen  und  schmalen  Corso \r\neinschränken  solle  und  werde. \r\n\r\nZuletzt  wird  die  Straße  in  der  Mitte  mit  Puzzolane  be- \r\nstreut, damit  die  wettrennenden  Pferde  auf  dem  glatten \r\nPflaster  nicht  so  leicht  ausgleiten  mögen. \r\n\r\nSignal  der  vollkommnen  Karnevalsfreiheit \r\n\r\nSo  findet  die  Erwartung  sich  jeden  Tag  genährt  und  be- \r\nschäftigt, bis  endlich  eine  Glocke  vom  Kapitol,  bald  nach \r\nMittage,  das  Zeichen  gibt,  es  sei  erlaubt,  unter  freiem  Him- \r\nmel töricht  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nIn  diesem  Augenblick  legt  der  ernsthafte  Römer,  der  sich \r\ndas  ganze  Jahr  sorgfältig  vor  jedem  Fehltritt  hütet,  sei- \r\nnen Ernst  und  seine  Bedächtigkeit  auf  einmal  ab. \r\nDie  Pflasterer,  die  bis  zum  letzten  AugenbHcke  geklappert \r\nhaben,  packen  ihr  Werkzeug  auf  und  machen  der  Arbeit \r\nscherzend  ein  Ende.  Alle  Balkone,  alle  Fenster  werden \r\nnach  und  nach  mit  Teppichen  behängt;  auf  den  Pflaster- \r\nerhöhungen zu  beiden  Seiten  der  Straße  werden  Stühle \r\nherausgesetzt;  die  geringern  Hausbewohner,  alle  Kinder \r\nsind  auf  der  Straße,  die  nun  aufhört,  eine  Straße  zu  sein: \r\nsie  gleicht  vielmehr  einem  großen  Festsaal,  einer  unge- \r\nheuren ausgeschmückten  Galerie. \r\n\r\nDenn  wie  alle  Fenster  mit  Teppichen  behängt  sind,  so \r\nstehen  auch  alle  Gerüste  mit  alten  gewirkten  Tapeten  be- \r\nschlagen; die  vielen  Stühle  vermehren  den  Begriff  von \r\nZimmer,  und  der  freundliche  Himmel  erinnert  selten,  daß \r\nman  ohne  Dach  sei. \r\n\r\nSo  scheint  die  Straße  nach  und  nach  immer  wohnbarer. \r\nIndem  man  aus  dem  Hause  tritt,  glaubt  man  nicht  im \r\nFreien  und  unter  Fremden,  sondern  in  einem  Saale  unter \r\nBekannten  zu  sein. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5 1 7 \r\n\r\nWache \r\nIndessen  daß  der  Corso  immer  belebter  wird  und  unter \r\nden  vielen  Personen,  die  in  ihren  gewöhnlichen  Kleidern \r\nspazieren,  sich  hier  und  da  ein  Pulcinell  zeigt,  hat  sich \r\ndas  Militär  vor  der  Porta  del  Popolo  versammelt.  Es  zieht, \r\nangeführt  von  dem  General  zu  Pferde,  in  guter  Ordnung \r\nund  neuer  Montur  mit  klingendem  Spiel  den  Corso  herauf \r\nund  besetzt  sogleich  alle  Eingänge  in  denselben,  errichtet \r\nein  paar  Wachen  auf  den  Hauptplätzen  und  übernimmt \r\ndie  Sorge  für  die  Ordnung  der  ganzen  Anstalt. \r\nDie  Verleiher  der  Stühle  und  Gerüste  rufen  nun  emsig  den \r\nVorbeigehenden  an:  Luoghi!  Luoghi,  Padroni!  Luoghi! \r\n\r\nMasken \r\nNun  fangen  die  Masken  an,  sich  zu  vermehren.  Junge  Män- \r\nner, geputzt  in  Festtagskleidern  der  Weiber  aus  der  un- \r\ntersten Klasse,  mit  entblößtem  Busen  und  frecher  Selbst- \r\ngenügsamkeit, lassen  sich  meist  zuerst  sehen.  Sie  lieb- \r\nkosen die  ihnen  begegnenden  Männer,  tun  gemein  und \r\nvertraut  mit  den  Weibern  als  mit  ihresgleichen,  treiben \r\nsonst,  was  ihnen  Laune,  Witz  oder  Unart  eingeben. \r\nWir  erinnern  uns  unter  andern  eines  jungen  Menschen, \r\nder  die  Rolle  einer  leidenschaftlichen,  zanksüchtigen  und \r\nauf  keine  Weise  zu  beruhigenden  Frau  vortrefflich  spielte \r\nund  so  sich  den  ganzen  Corso  hinab  zankte,  jedem  etwas \r\nanhängte,  indes  seine  Begleiter  sich  alle  Mühe  zu  geben \r\nschienen,  ihn  zu  besänftigen. \r\n\r\nHier  kommt  ein  Pulcinell  gelaufen,  dem  ein  großes  Hörn \r\nan  bunten  Schnüren  um  die  Hüften  gaukelt.  Durch  eine \r\ngeringe  Bewegung,  indem  er  sich  mit  den  Weibern  unter- \r\nhält, weiß  er  die  Gestalt  des  alten  Gottes  der  Gärten  in \r\ndemheiligenRom  kecklich  nachzuahmen,  und  seineLeicht- \r\nfertigkeit  erregt  mehr  Lust  als  Unwillen.  Hier  kommt  ein \r\nanderer  seinesgleichen,  der,  bescheidner  und  zufriedner, \r\nseine  schöne  Hälfte  mit  sich  bringt. \r\nDa  die  Frauen  eben  so  viel  Lust  haben,  sich  in  Manns- \r\nkleidern zu  zeigen,  als  die  Männer,  sich  in  Frauenkleidern \r\nsehen  zu  lassen,  so  haben  sie  die  beliebte  Tracht  des  Pul- \r\n\r\n\r\n5 1 8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\ncinells  sich  anzupassen  nicht  verfehlt,  und  man  muß  be- \r\nkennen, daß  es  ihnen  gelingt,  in  dieser  Zwittergestalt  oft \r\nhöchst  reizend  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nMit  schnellen  Schritten,  deklamierend  wie  vor  Gericht, \r\ndrängt  sich  ein  Advokat  durch  die  Menge;  er  schreit  an \r\ndie  Fenster  hinauf,  packt  maskierte  und  unmaskierte  Spa- \r\nziergänger an,  droht  einem  jeden  mit  einem  Prozeß,  macht \r\nbald  jenem  eine  lange  Geschichtserzählung  von  lächer- \r\nlichen Verbrechen,  die  er  begangen  haben  soll,  bald  die- \r\nsem eine  genaue  Spezifikation  seiner  Schulden.  Die  Frauen \r\nschilt  er  wegen  ihrer  Cicisbeen,  die  Mädchen  wegen  ihrer \r\nLiebhaber;  er  beruft  sich  auf  ein  Buch,  das  er  bei  sich \r\nführt,  produziert  Dokumente,  und  das  alles  mit  einer  durch- \r\ndringenden Stimme  und  geläufigen  Zunge.  Er  sucht  jeder- \r\nmann zu  beschämen  und  konfus  zu  machen.  Wenn  man \r\ndenkt,  er  höre  auf,  so  fängt  er  erst  recht  an;  denkt  man, \r\ner  gehe  weg,  so  kehrt  er  um;  auf  den  einen  geht  er  gerade \r\nlos  und  spricht  ihn  nicht  an,  er  packt  einen  andern,  der \r\nschon  vorbei  ist;  kommt  nun  gar  ein  Mitbruder  ihm  ent- \r\ngegen, so  erreicht  die  Tollheit  ihren  höchsten  Grad. \r\nAber  lange  können  sie  die  Aufmerksamkeit  des  Publikums \r\nnicht  auf  sich  ziehen;  der  tollste  Eindruck  wird  gleich  von \r\nMenge  und  Mannigfaltigkeit  wieder  verschlungen. \r\nBesonders  machen  die  Quacqueri  zwar  nicht  so  vielLärm, \r\ndoch  ebensoviel  Aufsehen  als  die  Advokaten.  Die  Maske \r\nder  Quacqueri  scheint  so  allgemein  geworden  zu  sein \r\ndurch  die  Leichtigkeit,  auf  dem  Trödel  altfränkische  Klei- \r\ndungsstücke finden  zu  können. \r\n\r\nDie  Haupterfordernisse  dieser  Maske  sind,  daß  die  Klei- \r\ndung zwar  altfränkisch,  aber  wohl  erhalten  und  von  edlem \r\nStoff  sei.  Man  sieht  sie  selten  anders  als  mit  Samt  oder \r\nSeide  bekleidet;  sie  tragen  brokatene  oder  gestickte \r\nWesten,  und  der  Statur  nach  muß  der  Quacquero  dickleibig \r\nsein;  seine  Gesichtsmaske  ist  ganz,  mit  Pausbacken  und \r\nkleinen  Augen;  seine  Perücke  hat  wunderliche  Zöpfchen; \r\nsein  Hut  ist  klein  und  meistens  bordiert. \r\nMan  siehet,  daß  sich  diese  Figur  sehr  dem  Buftb  caricato \r\nder  komischen  Oper  nähert,  und  wie  dieser  meistenteils \r\neinen  läppischen,  verliebten,  betrogenen  Toren  vorstellt. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  519 \r\n\r\nso  zeigen  sich  auch  diese  als  abgeschmackte  Stutzer.  Sie \r\nhüpfen  mit  großer  Leichtigkeit  auf  den  Zehen  hin  und  her, \r\nführen  große  schwarze  Ringe  ohne  Glas  statt  der  Lorg- \r\nnetten, womit  sie  in  alle  Wagen  hineingucken,  nach  allen \r\nFenstern  hinaufblicken.  Sie  machen  gewöhnlich  einen \r\nsteifen  tiefen  Bückling,  und  ihre  Freude,  besonders  wenn \r\nsie  sich  einander  begegnen,  geben  sie  dadurch  zu  erkennen, \r\ndaß  sie  mit  gleichen  Füßen  mehrmals  gerade  in  die  Höhe \r\nhüpfen  und  einen  hellen  durchdringenden  unartikulierten \r\nLaut  von  sich  geben,  der  mit  den  Konsonanten  brr  ver- \r\nbunden ist. \r\n\r\nOft  geben  sie  sich  durch  diesen  Ton  das  Zeichen,  und  die \r\nnächsten  erwidern  das  Signal,  so  daß  in  kurzer  Zeit  dieses \r\nGeschrille  den  ganzen  Corso  hin  und  wider  läuft. \r\nMutwillige  Knaben  blasen  indes  in  große  gewundne \r\nMuscheln  und  beleidigen  das  Ohr  mit  unerträglichen \r\nTönen. \r\n\r\nMan  sieht  bald,  daß  bei  der  Enge  des  Raums,  bei  der \r\nÄhnlichkeit  so  vieler  Maskenkleidungen — denn  es  mögen \r\nimmer  einige  hundert  Pulcinelle  und  gegen  hundert  Quac- \r\nqueri  im  Corso  auf  und  nieder  laufen — wenige  die  Ab- \r\nsicht haben  können,  Aufsehn  zu  erregen  oder  bemerkt  zu \r\nwerden.  Auch  müssen  diese  früh  genug  im  Corso  er- \r\nscheinen. Vielmehr  geht  ein  jeder  nur  aus,  sich  zu  ver- \r\ngnügen, seine  Tollheit  auszulassen  und  der  Freiheit  dieser \r\nTage  auf  das  beste  zu  genießen. \r\n\r\nBesonders  suchen  und  wissen  die  Mädchen  und  Frauen \r\nsich  in  dieser  Zeit  nach  ihrer  Art  lustig  zu  machen.  Jede \r\nsucht  nur  aus  dem  Hause  zu  kommen,  sich,  auf  welche \r\nArt  es  sei,  zu  vermummen,  und  weil  die  wenigsten  in  dem \r\nFall  sind,  viel  Geld  aufwenden  zu  können,  so  sind  sie \r\nerfinderisch  genug,  allerlei  Arten  auszudenken,  wie  sie \r\nsich  mehr  verstecken  als  zieren. \r\n\r\nSehr  leicht  sind  die  Masken  von  Bettlern  und  Bettlerinnen \r\nzu  schafien:  schöne  Haare  werden  vorzüglich  erfordert, \r\ndann  eine  ganz  weiße  Gesichtsmaske,  ein  irdenes  Töpf- \r\nchen an  einem  farbigen  Bande,  ein  Stab  und  ein  Hut  in \r\nder  Hand.  Sie  treten  mit  demütiger  Gebärde  unter  die \r\nFenster  und  vor  jeden  hin  und  empfangen  statt  Almosen \r\n\r\n\r\n5  2  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nZuckerwerk,  Nüsse,  und  was  man  ihnen  sonst  Artiges \r\ngeben  mag. \r\n\r\nAndere  machen  sich  es  noch  bequemer,  hüllen  sich  in \r\nPelze  oder  erscheinen  in  einer  artigen  Haustracht,  nur \r\nmit  Gesichtsmasken.  Sie  gehen  meistenteils  oline  Männer \r\nund  führen  als  OfF-  und  Defensivwafle  ein  Besenchen  aus \r\nder  Blüte  eines  Rohrs  gebunden,  womit  sie  teils  die  Über- \r\nlästigen abwehren,  teils  auch,  mutwillig  genug,  Bekannten \r\nund  Unbekannten,  die  ihnen  ohne  Masken  entgegenkom- \r\nmen, im  Gesicht  herumfahren. \r\n\r\nWenn  einer,  auf  den  sie  es  gemünzt  haben,  zwischen  vier \r\noder  fünf  solcher  Mädchen  hineinkommt,  weiß  er  sich \r\nnicht  zu  retten.  Das  Gedränge  hindert  ihn,  zu  fliehen, \r\nund  wo  er  sich  hinwendet,  fühlt  er  die  Besenchen  unter \r\nder  Nase.  Sich  ernstlich  gegen  diese  oder  andere  Necke- \r\nreien zu  wehren,  würde  sehr  gefährlich  sein,  weil  die \r\nMasken  unverletzlich  sind  und  jede  Wache  ihnen  beizu- \r\nstehen beordert  ist. \r\n\r\nEbenso  müssen  die  gewöhnlichen  Kleidungen  aller  Stände \r\nals  Masken  dienen.  Stallknechte  mit  ihren  großen  Bürsten \r\nkommen,  einem  jeden,  wenn  es  ihnen  beliebt,  den  Rücken \r\nauszukehren.  Vetturine  bieten  ihre  Dienste  mit  ihrer  ge- \r\nwöhnlichen Zudringlichkeit  an.  Zierlicher  sind  die  Mas- \r\nken der  Landmädchen,  Frascatanerinnen,  Fischer,  Nea- \r\npolitaner Schiffer,  Neapolitanischer  Sbirren  und  Grie- \r\nchen. \r\n\r\nManchmal  wird  eine  Maske  vom  Theater  nachgeahmt. \r\nEinige  machen  sichs  sehr  bequem,  indem  sie  sich  in \r\nTeppiche  oder  Leintücher  hüllen,  die  sie  über  dem  Kopfe \r\nzusammenbinden. \r\n\r\nDie  weiße  Gestalt  pflegt  gewöhnlich  andern  in  den  Weg \r\nzu  treten  und  vor  ihnen  zu  hüpfen  und  glaubt  auf  diese \r\nWeise  ein  Gespenst  vorzustellen.  Einige  zeichnen  sich \r\ndurch  sonderbare  Zusammensetzungen  aus,  und  der  Ta- \r\nbarro  wird  immer  für  die  edelste  Maske  gehalten,  weil \r\nsie  sich  gar  nicht  auszeichnet. \r\n\r\nWitzige  und  satirische  Masken  sind  sehr  selten,  weil  diese \r\nschon  Endzweck  haben  und  bemerkt  sein  wollen.  Doch \r\nsah  man  einen  Pulcinell  als  Hahnrei.    Die  Hörner  waren \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  ROMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5  2 1 \r\n\r\nbeweglich,  er  konnte  sie  wie  eine  Schnecke  heraus-  und \r\nhineinziehen.  Wenn  er  unter  ein  Fenster  vor  neu  Ver- \r\nheiratete trat  und  ein  Hörn  nur  wenig  sehen  Heß  oder \r\nvor  einem  andern  beide  Hörner  recht  lang  streckte  und \r\ndie  an  den  obern  Spitzen  befestigten  Schellen  recht \r\nwacker  klingelten,  entstand  auf  Augenblicke  eine  heitere \r\nAufmerksamkeit  des  Publikums  und  manchmal  ein  großes \r\nGelächter. \r\n\r\nEin  Zauberer  mischt  sich  unter  die  Menge,  läßt  das  Volk \r\nein  Buch  mit  Zahlen  sehn  und  erinnert  es  an  seine  Leiden- \r\nschaft zum  Lottospiel. \r\n\r\nMit  zwei  Gesichtern  steckt  einer  im  Gedränge:  man  weiß \r\nnicht,  welches  sein  Vorderteil,  welches  sein  Hinterteil  ist, \r\nob  er  kommt,  ob  er  geht. \r\n\r\nDer  Fremde  muß  sich  auch  gefallen  lassen,  in  diesen \r\nTagen  verspottet  zu  werden.  Die  langen  Kleider  der \r\nNordländer,  die  großen  Knöpfe,  die  wunderlichen  runden \r\nHüte  fallen  den  Römern  auf,  und  so  wird  ihnen  der \r\nFremde  eine  Maske. \r\n\r\nWeil  die  fremden  Maler,  besonders  die,  welche  Land- \r\nschaften und  Gebäude  studieren,  in  Rom  überall  öffent- \r\nlich sitzen  und  zeichnen,  so  werden  sie  auch  unter  der \r\nKarnevalsmenge  emsig  vorgestellt  und  zeigen  sich  mit \r\ngroßen  Portefeuillen,  langen  Surtouts  und  kolossalischen \r\nReißfedern  sehr  geschäftig. \r\n\r\nDie  deutschen  Bäckerknechte  zeichnen  sich  in  Rom  gar \r\noft  betrunken  aus,  und  sie  werden  auch  mit  einer  Flasche \r\nWein  in  ihrer  eigentlichen  oder  auch  etwas  verzierten \r\nTracht  taumelnd  vorgestellt. \r\n\r\nWir  erinnern  uns  einer  einzigen  anzüglichen  Maske.  Es \r\nsollte  ein  Obelisk  vor  der  Kirche  Trinitä  de'  Monti  auf- \r\ngerichtet werden.  Das  Publikum  war  nicht  sehr  damit \r\nzufrieden,  teils  weil  der  Platz  eng  ist,  teils  weil  man  dem \r\nkleinen  Obelisk,  um  ihn  in  eine  gewisse  Höhe  zu  bringen, \r\nein  sehr  hohes  Piedestal  unterbauen  mußte.  Es  nahm  daher \r\neiner  den  Anlaß,  ein  großes  weißes  Piedestal  als  Mütze \r\nzu  tragen,  auf  welchem  oben  ein  ganz  kleiner  rötlicher \r\nObelisk  befestigt  war.  An  dem  Piedestal  standen  große \r\nBuchstaben,  deren  Sinn  vielleicht  nur  wenige  errieten. \r\n\r\n\r\n52  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  KI \r\n\r\nKutschen \r\nIndessen  die  Masken  sich  vermehren,  fahren  die  Kutschen \r\nnach  und  nach  in  den  Corso  hinein,  in  derselben  Ord- \r\nnung, wie  wir  sie  oben  beschrieben  haben,  als  von  der \r\nsonn-  und  festtägigen  Spazierfahrt  die  Rede  war;  nur  mit \r\ndem  Unterschied,  daß  gegenwärtig  die  Fuhrwerke,  welche \r\nvom  Venezianischen  Palast  an  der  linken  Seite  herunter- \r\nfahreu,  da,  wo  die  Straße  des  Corso  aufhört,  wenden  und \r\nsogleich  an  der  andern  Seite  wieder  herauffaliren. \r\nWir  haben  schon  oben  angezeigt,  daß  die  Straße,  wenn \r\nman  die  Erhöhungen  für  die  Fußgänger  abrechnet,  an  den \r\nmeisten  Orten  wenig  über  drei  Wagenbreiten  hat. \r\nDie  Seitenerhöhungen  sind  alle  mit  Gerüsten  versperrt, \r\nmit  Stühlen  besetzt,  und  viele  Zuschauer  haben  schon \r\nihre  Plätze  eingenommen.  An  Gerüsten  und  Stühlen  geht \r\nganz  nahe  eine  Wagenreihe  hinunter  und  an  der  andern \r\nSeite  hinauf.  Die  Fußgänger  sind  in  eine  Breite  von \r\nhöchstens  acht  Fuß  zwischen  den  beiden  Reihen  einge- \r\nschlossen; jeder  drängt  sich  hin-  und  herwärts,  so  gut \r\ner  kann,  imd  von  allen  Fenstern  und  Baikonen  sieht  wieder \r\neine  gedrängte  Menge  auf  das  Gedränge  herunter. \r\nIn  den  ersten  Tagen  sieht  man  meist  nur  die  gewöhn- \r\nlichen Equipagen;  denn  jeder  verspart  auf  die  folgenden, \r\nwas  er  Zierliches  oder  Prächtiges  allenfalls  aufführen  will. \r\nGegen  Ende  des  Karnevals  kommen  mehr  offene  Wagen \r\nzum  Vorschein,  deren  einige  sechs  Sitze  haben:  zwei \r\nDamen  sitzen  erhöht  gegen  einander  über,  so  daß  man \r\nihre  ganze  Gestalt  sehen  kann,  vier  Herren  nehmen  die \r\nvier  übrigen  Sitze  der  Winkel  ein,  Kutscher  und  Be- \r\ndiente sind  maskiert,  die  Pferde  mit  Flor  und  Blumen \r\ngeputzt. \r\n\r\nOft  steht  ein  schöner,  weißer,  mit  rosenfarbnen  Bändern \r\ngezierter  Pudel  dem  Kutscher  zwischen  den  Füßen,  an \r\ndem  Geschirre  klingen  Schellen,  und  die  Aufmerksamkeit \r\ndes  Publikums  wird  einige  Augenblicke  auf  diesen  Auf- \r\nzug geheftet. \r\n\r\nMan  kann  leicht  denken,  daß  nur  schöne  Frauen  sich  so \r\nvor  dem  ganzen  Volke  zu  erhöhen  wagen  und  daß  nur \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  523 \r\n\r\ndie  schönste  ohne  Gesichtsmaske  sich  sehen  läßt.  Wo \r\nsich  denn  aber  auch  der  Wagen  nähert,  der  gewöhnlich \r\nlangsam  genug  fahren  muß,  sind  alle  Augen  darauf  ge- \r\nrichtet, und  sie  hat  die  Freude,  von  manchen  Seiten  zu \r\nhören:  O  quanto  e  bella! \r\n\r\nEhemals  sollen  diese  Prachtwagen  weit  häufiger  und  kost- \r\nbarer, auch  durch  mythologische  und  allegorische  Vor- \r\nstellungen interessanter  gewesen  sein;  neuerdings  aber \r\nscheinen  die  Vornehmern,  es  sei  nun  aus  welchem  Grunde \r\nes  wolle,  verloren  in  dem  Ganzen,  das  Vergnügen,  das \r\nsie  noch  bei  dieser  Feierlichkeit  finden,  mehr  genießen \r\nals  sich  vor  andern  auszeichnen  zu  wollen. \r\nJe  weiter  das  Karneval  vorrückt,  desto  lustiger  sehen  die \r\nEquipagen  aus. \r\n\r\nSelbst  ernsthafte  Personen,  welche  unmaskiert  in  den \r\nWagen  sitzen,  erlauben  ihren  Kutschern  und  Bedienten, \r\nsich  zu  maskieren.  Die  Kutscher  wählen  meistenteils  die \r\nFrauentracht,  und  in  den  letzten  Tagen  scheinen  nur \r\nWeiber  die  Pferde  zu  regieren.  Sie  sind  oft  anständig, \r\nja  reizend  gekleidet;  dagegen  macht  denn  auch  ein  breiter \r\nhäßlicher  Kerl,  in  völlig  neumodischem  Putz,  mit  hoher \r\nFrisur  und  Federn,  eine  große  Karikatur;  und  wie  jene \r\nSchönheiten  ihr  Lob  zu  hören  hatten,  so  muß  er  sich  ge- \r\nfallen lassen,  daß  ihm  einer  unter  die  Nase  tritt  und  ihm \r\nzuruft:  O  fratello  mio,  che  brutta  puttana  sei! \r\nGewöhnlich  erzeigt  der  Kutscher  einer  oder  einem  Paar \r\nseiner  Freundinnen  den  Dienst,  wenn  er  sie  im  Gedränge \r\nantrifft,  sie  auf  den  Bock  zu  heben.  Diese  sitzen  denn \r\ngewöhnlich  in  Mannstracht  an  seiner  Seite,  und  oft  gau- \r\nkeln dann  die  niedlichen  Pulcinellbeinchen  mit  kleinen \r\nFüßchen  und  hohen  Absätzen  den  Vorübergehenden  um \r\ndie  Köpfe. \r\n\r\nEbenso  machen  es  die  Bedienten  und  nehmen  ihre  Freunde \r\nund  Freundinnen  hinten  auf  den  Wagen,  und  es  fehlt \r\nnichts,  als  daß  sie  sich  noch,  wie  auf  die  englischen  Land- \r\nkutschen, oben  auf  den  Kasten  setzten. \r\nDie  Herrschaften  selbst  scheinen  es  gerne  zu  sehen,  wenn \r\nihre  Wagen  recht  bepackt  sind;  alles  ist  in  diesen  Tagen \r\nvergönnt  und  schicklich. \r\n\r\n\r\n5  2  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nGedränge \r\nMan  werfe  nun  einen  Blick  über  die  lange  und  schmale \r\nStraße,  wo  von  allen  Baikonen  und  aus  allen  Fenstern, \r\nüber  lang  herabhängende  bunte  Teppiche,  gedrängte  Zu- \r\nschauer auf  die  mit  Zuschauern  angefüllten  Gerüste,  auf \r\ndie  langen  Reihen  besetzter  Stühle  an  beiden  Seiten  der \r\nStraße  herunterschauen.  Zwei  Reihen  Kutschen  bewegen \r\nsich  langsam  in  dem  mittlem  Raum,  und  der  Platz,  den \r\nallenfalls  eine  dritte  Kutsche  einnehmen  konnte,  ist  ganz \r\nmit  Menschen  ausgefüllt,  welche  nicht  hin  und  wider \r\ngehen,  sondern  sich  hin  und  wider  schieben.  Da  die \r\nKutschen  so  lang,  als  es  nur  möglich  ist,  sich  immer \r\nein  wenig  voneinander  abhalten,  um  nicht  bei  jeder \r\nStockung  gleich  aufeinander  zu  fahren,  so  wagen  sich  viele \r\nder  Fußgänger,  um  nur  einigermaßen  Luft  zu  schöpfen, \r\naus  dem  Gedränge  der  Mitte  zwischen  die  Räder  des \r\nvorausfahrenden  und  die  Deichsel  und  Pferde  des  nach- \r\nfahrenden Wagens,  und  je  größer  die  Gefahr  und  Be- \r\nschwerlichkeit der  Fußgänger  wird,  desto  mehr  scheint \r\nihre  Laune  und  Kühnheit  zu  steigen. \r\nDa  die  meisten  Fußgänger,  welche  zwischen  den  beiden \r\nKutschenreihen  sich  bewegen,  um  ihre  Glieder  und  Klei- \r\ndungen zu  schonen,  die  Räder  und  Achsen  sorgfältig  ver- \r\nmeiden, so  lassen  sie  gewöhnlich  mehr  Platz  zwischen \r\nsich  und  den  Wagen,  als  nötig  ist;  wer  nun  mit  der  lang- \r\nsamen Masse  sich  fortzubewegen  nicht  länger  ausstehen \r\nmag  und  Mut  hat,  zwischen  den  Rädern  und  Fußgängern, \r\nzwischen  der  Gefahr  und  dem,  der  sich  davor  fürchtet, \r\ndurchzuschlüpfen,  der  kann  in  kurzer  Zeit  einen  großen \r\nWeg  zurücklegen,  bis  er  sich  wieder  durch  ein  anderes \r\nHindernis  aufgehalten  sieht. \r\n\r\nSchon  gegenwärtig  scheint  unsere  Erzählung  außer  den \r\nGrenzen  des  Glaubwürdigen  zu  schreiten,  und  wir  würden \r\nkaum  wagen  fortzufahren,  wenn  nicht  so  viele,  die  dem \r\nrömischen  Karneval  beigewohnt,  bezeugen  könnten,  daß \r\nwir  uns  genau  an  der  Wahrheit  gehalten,  und  wenn  es \r\nnicht  ein  Fest  wäre,  das  sich  jährlich  wiederholt  und  das \r\nvon  manchem  mit  diesem  Buche  in  der  Hand  künftig  be- \r\ntrachtet werden  wird. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  525 \r\n\r\nDenn  was  werden  unsere  Leser  sagen,  wenn  wir  ihnen \r\nerklären,  alles  bisher  Erzählte  sei  nur  gleichsam  der  erste \r\nGrad  des  Gedränges,  des  Getümmels,  des  Lärmens  und \r\nder  Ausgelassenheit? \r\n\r\nZug  des  Goiivcrncias  und  Senators \r\n\r\nIndem  die  Kutschen  sachte  vorwärts  rücken  und,  wenn \r\nes  eine  Stockung  gibt,  stille  halten,  werden  die  Fußgänger \r\nauf  mancherlei  Weise  geplagt. \r\n\r\nEinzeln  reitet  die  Garde  des  Papstes  durch  das  Gedränge \r\nhin  und  wider,  um  die  zufälligen  Unordnungen  und  Stok- \r\nkungen  der  Wagen  ins  Geleis  zu  bringen,  und  indem  einer \r\nden  Kutschpferden  ausweicht,  fühlt  er,  ehe  er  sichs  ver- \r\nsieht, den  Kopf  eines  Reitpferdes  im  Nacken;  allein  es \r\nfolgt  eine  größere  Unbequemlichkeit. \r\nDer  Gouverneur  fährt  in  einem  großen  Staatswagen  mit \r\neinem  Gefolge  von  mehreren  Kutschen  durch  die  Mitte \r\nzwischen  den  beiden  Reihen  der  übrigen  Wagen  durch. \r\nDie  Garde  des  Papstes  und  die  vorausgehenden  Bedienten \r\nwarnen  und  machen  Platz,  und  dieser  Zug  nimmt  für  den \r\nAugenblick  die  ganze  Breite  ein,  die  kurz  vorher  den  Fuß- \r\ngängern noch  übrig  blieb.  Sie  drängen  sich,  so  gut  sie \r\nkönnen,  zwischen  die  übrigen  Wagen  hinein  und  auf  eine \r\noder  die  andere  Weise  beiseite.  Und  wie  das  Wasser,  wenn \r\nein  Schiff\"  durchfährt,  sich  nur  einen  Augenblick  trennt \r\nund  hinter  dem  Steuerruder  gleich  wieder  zusammenstürzt, \r\nso  strömt  auch  die  Masse  der  Masken  und  der  übrigen \r\nFußgänger  hinter  dem  Zuge  gleich  wieder  in  eins  zu- \r\nsammen. Nicht  lange,  so  stört  eine  neue  Bewegung  die \r\ngedrängte  Gesellschaft. \r\n\r\nDer  Senator  rückt  mit  einem  ähnlichen  Zuge  heran;  sein \r\ngroßer  Staatswagen  und  die  Wagen  seines  Gefolges \r\nschwimmen  wie  auf  den  Köpfen  der  erdrückten  Menge, \r\nund  wenn  jeder  Einheimische  und  Fremde  von  der  Lie- \r\nbenswürdigkeit des  gegenwärtigen  Senators,  des  Prinzen \r\nRezzonico,  eingenommen  und  bezaubert  wird,  so  ist  viel- \r\nleicht dieses  der  einzige  Fall,  wo  eine  Masse  von  Men- \r\nschen sich  glücklich  preist,  wenn  er  sich  entfernt. \r\n\r\n\r\n5  2  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nWenn  diese  beiden  Züge  der  ersten  Gerichts-  und  Poli- \r\nzeiherren von  Rom,  nur  um  das  Karneval  feierlich  zu  er- \r\nöffnen, den  ersten  Tag  durch  den  Corso  gedrungen  waren, \r\nfuhr  der  Herzog  von  Albanien  täglich,  zu  großer  Unbe- \r\nquemlichkeit der  Menge,  gleichfalls  diesen  Weg  und  er- \r\ninnerte zur  Zeit  der  allgemeinen  Mummerei  die  alte  Be- \r\nherrscherin der  Könige  an  das  Fastnachtsspiel  seiner \r\nköniglichen  Prätensionen. \r\n\r\nDie  Gesandten,  welche  das  gleiche  Recht  haben,  bedienen \r\nsich  dessen  sparsam  und  mit  einer  humanen  Diskretion. \r\n\r\nSchöne  Welt  am  Palast  Ruspoli \r\n\r\nAber  nicht  allein  durch  diese  Züge  wird  die  Zirkulation \r\ndes  Corso  unterbrochen  und  gehindert;  am  Palast  Ruspoli \r\nund  in  dessen  Nähe,  wo  die  Straße  um  nichts  breiter \r\nwird,  sind  die  Pflasterwege  an  beiden  Seiten  mehr  erhöht. \r\nDort  nimmt  die  schöne  Welt  ihren  Platz,  und  alle  Stühle \r\nsind  bald  besetzt  oder  besprochen.  Die  schönsten  Frauen- \r\nzimmer der  INIittelklassc,  reizend  maskiert,  umgeben  von \r\nihren  Freunden,  zeigen  sich  dort  dem  vorübergehenden \r\nneugierigen  Auge.  Jeder,  der  in  die  Gegend  kommt, \r\nverweilt,  um  die  angenehmen  Reihen  zu  durchschauen; \r\njeder  ist  neugierig,  unter  den  vielen  männlichen  Gestal- \r\nten, die  dort  zu  sitzen  scheinen,  die  weiblichen  heraus- \r\nzusuchen und  vielleicht  in  einem  niedlichen  Offizier  den \r\nGegenstand  seiner  Sehnsucht  zu  entdecken.  Hier  an \r\ndiesem  Flecke  stockt  die  Bewegung  zuerst:  denn  die \r\nKutschen  verweilen,  so  lange  sie  können,  in  dieser  Gegend, \r\nund  wenn  man  zuletzt  halten  soll,  will  man  doch  lieber \r\nin  dieser  angenehmen  Gesellschaft  bleiben. \r\n\r\nConfctti \r\n\r\nWenn  unsere  Beschreibung  bisher  nur  den  Begrifif  von \r\neinem  engen,  ja  beinahe  ängstlichen  Zustande  gegeben \r\nhat,  so  wird  sie  einen  noch  sonderbarem  Eindruck  macheu, \r\nwenn  wir  ferner  erzählen,  wie  diese  gedrängte  Lustbarkeit \r\ndurch  eine  Art  von  kleinem,  meist  scherzhaftem.,  oft  aber \r\nnur  allzu  ernstlichem  Kriege  in  Bewegung  gesetzt  wird. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  527 \r\n\r\nWahrscheinlich  hat  einmal  zufällig  eine  Schöne  ihren  vor- \r\nbeigehenden guten  Freund,  um  sich  ihm  unter  der  Menge \r\nund  Maske  bemerklich  zu  machen,  mit  verzuckerten  Kör- \r\nnern angeworfen,  da  denn  nichts  natürlicher  ist,  als  daß \r\nder  Getroffene  sich  umkehre  und  die  lose  Freundin  ent- \r\ndecke; dieses  ist  nun  ein  allgemeiner  Gebrauch,  und  man \r\nsieht  oft  nach  einem  Wurfe  ein  paar  freundliche  Ge- \r\nsichter sich  einander  begegnen.  Allein  man  ist  teils  zu \r\nhaushälterisch,  um  wirkliches  Zuckerwerk  zu  verschwen- \r\nden, teils  hat  der  Mißbrauch  desselben  einen  größern \r\nund  wohlfeilem  Vorrat  nötig  gemacht. \r\nEs  ist  nun  ein  eignes  Gewerbe,  Gipszeltlein,  durch  den \r\nTrichter  gemacht,  die  den  Schein  von  Dragden  haben,  in \r\ngroßen  Körben  zum  Verkauf  mitten  durch  die  Menge  zu \r\ntragen. \r\n\r\nNiemand  ist  vor  einem  Angriff  sicher,  jedermann  ist  im \r\nVerteidigungszustande,  und  so  entsteht  aus  Mutwillen  oder \r\nNotwendigkeit  bald  hier  bald  da  ein  Zweikampf,  ein  Schar- \r\nmützel oder  eine  Schlacht.  Fußgänger,  Kutschenfahrer, \r\nZuschauer  aus  Fenstern,  von  Gerüsten  oder  Stühlen  grei- \r\nfen einander  wechselsweise  an  und  verteidigen  sich  wech- \r\nselsweise. \r\n\r\nDie  Damen  haben  vergoldete  und  versilberte  Körbchen \r\nvoll  dieser  Körner,  und  die  Begleiter  wissen  ilire  Schönen \r\nsehr  wacker  zu  verteidigen.  Mit  niedergelassenen  Kut- \r\nschenfenstern erwartet  man  den  Angriff,  man  scherzt  mit \r\nseinen  Freunden  und  wehrt  sich  hartnäckig  gegen  Unbe- \r\nkannte. \r\n\r\nNirgends  aber  wird  dieser  Streit  ernstlicher  und  allge- \r\nmeiner als  in  der  Gegend  des  Palasts  Ruspoli.  Alle  Mas- \r\nken, die  sich  dort  niedergelassen  haben,  sind  mit  Körb- \r\nchen, Säckchen,  zusammengebundnen  Schnupftüchern \r\nversehen.  Sie  greifen  öfter  an,  als  sie  angegriffen  werden. \r\nKeine  Kutsche  fährt  ungestraft  vorbei,  ohne  daß  ihr  nicht \r\nwenigstens  einige  Masken  etwas  anhängen.  Kein  Fuß- \r\ngänger ist  vor  ihnen  sicher;  besonders  wenn  sich  ein  Ab- \r\nbate  im  schwarzen  Rocke  sehen  läßt,  werfen  alle  von \r\nallen  Seiten  auf  ihn,  und  weil  Gips  und  Kreide,  wohin  sie \r\ntreuen,  abfärben,  so  sieht  ein  solcher  bald  über  und  über \r\n\r\n\r\n5  2  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nweiß  und  grau  punktiert  aus.  Oft  aber  werden  die  Hän- \r\ndel sehr  ernsthaft  und  allgemein,  und  man  sieht  mit  Er- \r\nstaunen, wie  Eifersucht  und  persönlicher  Haß  sich  freien \r\nLauf  lassen. \r\n\r\nUnbemerkt  schleicht  sich  eine  vermummte  Figur  heran \r\nund  trifft  mit  einer  Hand  voll  Confetti  eine  der  ersten \r\nSchönheiten  so  heftig,  und  so  gerade,  daß  die  Gesichts- \r\nmaske widerschallt  und  ihr  schöner  Hals  verletzt  wird. \r\nIhre  Begleiter  zu  beiden  Seiten  werden  heftig  aufgereizt, \r\naus  ihren  Körbchen  und  Säckchen  stürmen  sie  gewaltig \r\nauf  den  Angreifenden  los;  er  ist  aber  so  gut  vermummt, \r\nzu  stark  geharnischt,  als  daß  er  ihre  wiederholten  Würfe \r\nempfinden  sollte.  Je  sicherer  er  ist,  desto  heftiger  setzt \r\ner  seinen  Angriff\"  fort;  die  Verteidiger  decken  das  Frauen- \r\nzimmer mit  den  Tabarros  zu,  und  weil  der  Angreifende \r\nin  der  Heftigkeit  des  Streits  auch  die  Nachbarn  verletzt \r\nund  überhaupt  durch  seine  Grobheit  und  Ungestüm  jeder- \r\nmann beleidigt,  so  nehmen  die  Umhersitzenden  teil  an \r\ndiesem  Streit,  sparen  ihre  Gipskörner  nicht  und  haben \r\nmeistenteils  auf  solche  Fälle  eine  etwas  größere  Muni- \r\ntion, ungefähr  wie  verzuckerte  Mandeln,  in  Reserve,  wo- \r\ndurch der  Angreifende  zuletzt  so  zugedeckt  und  von  allen \r\nSeiten  her  überfallen  wird,  daß  ihm  nichts  als  die  Retraite \r\nübrig  bleibt,  besonders  wenn  er  sich  verschossen  haben \r\nsollte. \r\n\r\nGewöhnlich  hat  einer,  der  auf  ein  solches  Abenteuer  aus- \r\ngeht, einen  Sekundanten  bei  sich,  der  ihm  Munition  zu- \r\nsteckt, inzwischen  daß  die  Männer,  welche  mit  solchen \r\nGipsconfetti  handeln,  während  des  Streits  mit  ihren  Kör- \r\nben geschäftig  sind  und  einem  jeden,  so  viel  Pfund  er \r\nverlangt,  eilig  zuwiegen. \r\n\r\nWir  haben  selbst  einen  solchen  Streit  in  der  Nähe  ge- \r\nsehn, wo  zuletzt  die  Streitenden,  aus  Mangel  an  Muni- \r\ntion, sich  die  vergoldeten  Körbchen  an  die  Köpfe  warfen \r\nund  sich  durch  die  Warnungen  der  Wachen,  welche  selbst \r\nheftig  mitgetroöen  wurden,  nicht  abhalten  ließen, \r\n(jewiß  würde  mancher  solche  Handel  mit  Messerstichen \r\nsich  endigen,  wenn  nicht  die  an  mehreren  Ecken  aufge- \r\nzogenen Korden,  die  bekannten  Strafwerkzeuge  italieni- \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  529 \r\n\r\nscher  Polizei,  jeden  mitten  in  der  Lustbarkeit  erinnerten, \r\ndaß  es  in  diesem  Augenblicke  sehr  gefährlich  sei,  sich \r\ngefährlicher  Waöen  zu  bedienen. \r\n\r\nUnzählig  sind  diese  Händel,  und  die  meisten  mehr  lustig \r\nals  ernsthaft. \r\n\r\nSo  kommt  zum  Exempel  ein  offner  Wagen  voll  Pulcinel- \r\nlen  gegen  Ruspoli  heran.  Er  nimmt  sich  vor,  indem  er \r\nbei  den  Zuschauern  vorbeifährt,  alle  nacheinander  zutref- \r\nfen; allein  unglücklicherweise  ist  das  Gedränge  zu  groß, \r\nund  er  bleibt  in  der  Mitte  stecken.  Die  ganze  Gesell- \r\nschaft wird  auf  einmal  eines  Sinnes,  und  von  allen  Seiten \r\nhagelt  es  auf  den  Wagen  los.  Die  Pulcinelle  verschießen \r\nihre  Munition  und  bleiben  eine  gute  Weile  dem  kreuzen- \r\nden Feuer  von  allen  Seiten  ausgesetzt,  so  daß  der  Wagen \r\nam  Ende  ganz  wie  mit  Schnee  und  Schloßen  bedeckt, \r\nunter  einem  allgemeinen  Gelächter  und  von  Tönen  des \r\nMißbilligens  begleitet,  sich  langsam  entfernt. \r\n\r\nDialog  am  obern  Ende  des  Corso \r\n\r\nIndessen  in  dem  Mittelpunkte  des  Corso  diese  lebhaften \r\nund  heftigen  Spiele  einen  großen  Teil  der  schönen  Welt \r\nbeschäftigen,  findet  ein  anderer  Teil  des  Publikums  an \r\ndem  obern  Ende  des  Corso  eine  andere  Art  von  Unter- \r\nhaltung. \r\n\r\nOhnweit  der  französischen  Akademie  tritt,  in  spanischer \r\nTracht,  mit  Federhut,  Degen  und  großen  Handschuhen, \r\nunversehens  mitten  aus  den  von  einem  Gerüste  zuschau- \r\nenden Masken  der  sogenannte  Capitano  des  italienischen \r\nTheaters  auf  und  fängt  an,  seine  große  Taten  zu  Land \r\nund  Wasser  in  emphatischem  Ton  zu  erzählen.  Es  währt \r\nnicht  lange,  so  erhebt  sich  gegen  ihm  über  ein  Pulcinell, \r\nbringt  Zweifel  und  Einwendungen  vor,  und  indem  er  ihm \r\nalles  zuzugeben  scheint,  macht  er  die  Großsprecherei  je- \r\nnes Helden  durch  Wortspiele  und  eingeschobene  Platt- \r\nheiten lächerlich. \r\n\r\nAuch  hier  bleibt  jeder  Vorbeigehende  stehen  und  hört \r\ndem  lebhaften  Wortwechsel  zu. \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  34 \r\n\r\n\r\n53 o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nPulcinellenkönig \r\nEin  neuer  Aufzug  vermehret  oft  das  Gedränge.  Ein  Dut- \r\nzend Pulcinelle  tun  sich  zusammen,  erwählen  einen  Kö- \r\nnig, krönen  ihn,  geben  ihm  ein  Zepter  in  die  Hand,  be- \r\ngleiten ihn  mit  Musik  und  führen  ihn  unter  lautem  Geschrei \r\nauf  einem  verzierten  Wägelchen  den  Corso  herauf.  Alle \r\nPulcinelle  springen  herbei,  wie  der  Zug  vorwärts  geht, \r\nvermehren  das  Gefolge  und  machen  sich  mit  Gesclirei \r\nund  Schwenken  der  Hüte  Platz. \r\n\r\nAlsdann  bemerkt  man  erst,  wie  jeder  diese  allgemeine \r\nMaske  zu  vermannigfaltigen  sucht.  Der  eine  trägt  eine \r\nPerücke,  der  andere  eine  Weiberhaube  zu  seinem  schwar- \r\nzen Gesicht,  der  dritte  hat  statt  der  Mütze  einen  Käfig \r\nauf  dem  Kopfe,  in  welchem  ein  paar  Vögel,  als  Abbate \r\nund  Dame  gekleidet,  auf  den  Stängelchen  hin  und  wider \r\nhüpfen. \r\n\r\nNebenstraßen \r\nDas  entsetzliche  Gedränge,  das  wir  unsern  Lesern  so  viel \r\nals  möglich  zu  vergegenwärtigen  gesucht  haben,  zwingt \r\nnatürlicherweise  eine  Menge  Masken  aus  dem  Corso  hin- \r\naus in  die  benachbarten  Straßen.  Da  gehen  verliebte \r\nPaare  ruhiger  und  vertrauter  zusammen,  da  finden  lustige \r\nGesellen  Platz,  allerlei  tolle  Schauspiele  vorzustellen. \r\nEine  Gesellschaft  Männer  in  der  Sonntagstracht  des  ge- \r\nmeinen Volkes,  in  kiu-zen  Wämsern  mit  goldbesetzten \r\nWesten  darunter,  die  Haare  in  ein  lang  herunterhängen- \r\ndes Netz  gebunden,  gehen  mit  jungen  Leuten,  die  sich  als \r\nWeiber  verkleidet  haben,  hin  und  wider  spazieren.  Eine \r\nvon  den  Frauen  scheint  hochschwanger  zu  sein,  sie  gehen \r\nfriedlich  auf  und  nieder.  Auf  einmal  entzweien  sich  die \r\nMänner,  es  entstehet  ein  lebhafter  Wortwechsel,  die  Frauen \r\nmischen  sich  hinein,  der  Handel  wird  immer  ärger;  end- \r\nlich ziehen  die  Streitenden  große  Messer  von  versilberter \r\nPappe  und  fallen  einander  an.  Die  Weiber  halten  sie  mit \r\ngräßlichem  Geschrei  auseinander,  man  zieht  den  einen \r\nda,  den  andern  dort  hin,  die  Umstehenden  nehmen  teil, \r\nals  wenn  es  Ernst  wäre,  man  sucht  jede  Partei  zu  besänf- \r\ntigen. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5  3 1 \r\n\r\nIndessen  befindet  sich  die  hochschwangere  Frau  durch \r\nden  Schrecken  übel;  es  wird  ein  Stuhl  herbeigebracht, \r\ndie  übrigen  Weiber  stehen  ihr  bei,  sie  gebärdet  sich  jäm- \r\nmerlich, und  ehe  man  sichs  versieht,  bringt  sie  zu  gi-oßer \r\nErlustigung  der  Umstehenden  irgend  eine  unförmliche  Ge- \r\nstalt zur  Welt.  Das  Stück  ist  aus,  und  die  Truppe  zieht \r\nweiter,  um  dasselbe  oder  ein  ähnliches  Stück  an  einem \r\nandern  Platz  vorzustellen. \r\n\r\nSo  spielt  der  Römer,  dem  die  Mordgeschichten  immer \r\nvor  der  Seele  schweben,  gern  bei  jedem  Anlaß  mit  den \r\nIdeen  von  Ammazzieren.  Sogar  die  Kinder  haben  ein \r\nSpiel,  das  sie  Chiesa nennen,  welches  mit  unserm  \"Frisch- \r\nauf iu  allen  Ecken\"  übereinkommt,  eigentlich  aber  einen \r\nMörder  vorstellt,  der  sich  auf  die  Stufe  einer  Kirche  ge- \r\nflüchtet hat;  die  übrigen  stellen  die  Sbirren  vor  und  su- \r\nchen ihn  auf  allerlei  Weise  zu  fangen,  ohne  jedoch  den \r\nSchutzort  betreten  zu  dürfen. \r\n\r\nSo  geht  es  denn  in  den  Seitenstraßen,  besonders  der  Strada \r\nBabuino  und  auf  dem  Spanischen  Platze,  ganz  lustig  zu. \r\nAuch  kommen  die  Quacqueri  zu  Scharen,  um  ihre  Ga- \r\nlanterien freier  anzubringen.  Sie  haben  ein  Manöver, \r\nwelches  jeden  zu  lachen  macht.  Sie  kommen  zu  zwölf \r\nMann  hoch  ganz  strack  auf  den  Zehen  mit  kleinen  und \r\nschnellen  Schritten  anmarschiert,  formieren  eine  sehr  ge- \r\nrade Fronte;  auf  einmal,  wenn  sie  auf  einen  Platz  kom- \r\nmen, bilden  sie,  mit  rechts  oder  links  um,  eine  Kolonne \r\nund  trippeln  nun  hintereinander  weg.  Auf  einmal  wird, \r\nmit  rechts  um,  die  Fronte  wieder  hergestellt,  und  so  gehts \r\neine  Straße  hinein;  dann,  ehe  man  sichs  versieht,  wieder \r\nlinks  um:  die  Kolonne  ist  wie  an  einem  Spieß  zu  einer \r\nHaustüre  hineingeschoben,  und  die  Toren  sind  ver- \r\nschwunden. \r\n\r\nAbend \r\nNun  geht  es  nach  dem  Abend  zu,  und  alles  drängt  sich \r\nimmer  mehr  in  den  Corso  hinein.  Die  Bewegung  der \r\nKutschen  stockt  schon  lange,  ja  es  kann  geschehen,  daß \r\nzwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht  schon  kein  Wagen  mehr  von  der \r\nStelle  kann. \r\n\r\n\r\n532  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nDie  Garde  des  Papstes  und  die  Wachen  zu  Fuß  sind  nun \r\nbeschäftigt,  alle  Wagen,  soweit  es  möglich,  von  der  Mitte \r\nab  und  in  eine  ganz  gerade  Reihe  zu  bringen,  und  es  gibt \r\nbei  der  Menge  hier  mancherlei  Unordnung  und  Verdruß. \r\nDa  wird  gehuft,  geschoben,  gehoben,  und  indem  einer \r\nhuft,  müssen  alle  hinter  ihm  auch  zurückweichen,  bis  ei- \r\nner zuletzt  so  in  die  Klemme  kommt,  daß  er  mit  seinen \r\nPferden  in  die  Mitte  hineinlenken  muß.  Alsdann  geht \r\ndas  Schelten  der  Garde,  das  Fluchen  und  Drohen  der \r\nWache  an. \r\n\r\nVergebens,  daß  der  unglückliche  Kutscher  die  augen- \r\nscheinliche Unmöglichkeit  dartut;  es  wird  auf  ihn  hinein \r\ngescholten  und  gedroht,  und  entweder  es  muß  sich  wie- \r\nder fügen,  oder  wenn  ein  Nebengäßchen  in  der  Nähe  ist, \r\nmuß  er  ohne  Verschulden  aus  der  Reihe  hinaus.  Ge- \r\nwöhnlich sind  die  Nebengäßchen  auch  mit  haltenden  Kut- \r\nschen besetzt,  die  zu  spät  kamen  und,  weil  der  Umgang \r\nder  Wagen  schon  ins  Stocken  geraten  war,  nicht  mehr \r\neinrücken  konnten. \r\n\r\nVorbereitung  zum  Wettrenneii \r\nDer  Augenblick  des  Wettrennens  der  Pferde  nähert  sich \r\nnun  immer  mehr,  und  auf  diesen  Augenblick  ist  das  In- \r\nteresse so  vieler  tausend  Menschen  gespannt. \r\nDie  Verleiher  der  Stühle,  die  Unternehmer  der  Gerüste \r\nvermehren  nun  ihr  anbietendes  Geschrei:  Luocrhi!  Luoghi \r\navanti!  Luoghi  nobili!  Luoghi,  Padroni!  Es  ist  darum  zu \r\ntun,  daß  ihnen  wenigstens  in  diesen  letzten  Augenblicken, \r\nauch  gegen  ein  geringeres  Geld,  alle  Plätze  besetzt \r\nwerden. \r\n\r\nUnd  glücklich,  daß  hier  und  da  noch  Platz  zu  finden  ist: \r\ndenn  der  General  reitet  nunmehr  mit  einem  Teil  der \r\nGarde  den  Corso  zwischen  den  beiden  Reihen  Kutschen \r\nherunter  und  verdrängt  die  Fußgänger  von  dem  einzigen \r\nRaum,  der  ihnen  noch  übrig  blieb.  Jeder  sucht  alsdann \r\nnoch  einen  Stuhl,  einen  Platz  auf  einem  Gerüste,  auf  ei- \r\nner Kutsche,  zwischen  den  Wagen  oder  bei  Bekannten \r\nan  einem  Fenster  zu  finden,  die  denn  nun  alle  von  Zu- \r\nschauern über  und  über  strotzen. \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  533 \r\n\r\nIndessen  ist  der  Platz  vor  dem  Obelisk  ganz  vom  Volke \r\ngereiniget  worden  und  gewährt  vielleicht  einen  der  schön- \r\nsten Anblicke,  welche  in  der  gegenwärtigen  Welt  gesehen \r\nwerden  können. \r\n\r\nDie  drei  mit  Teppichen  behängten  Fassaden  der  oben \r\nbeschriebenen  Gerüste  schließen  den  Platz  ein.  Viele  tau- \r\nsend Köpfe  schauen  übereinander  hervor  und  geben  das \r\nBild  eines  alten  Amphitheaters  oder  Zirkus.  Über  dem \r\nmittelsten  Gerüste  steigt  die  ganze  Länge  des  Obelisken \r\nin  die  Luft;  denn  das  Gerüste  bedeckt  nur  sein  Piedestal, \r\nund  man  bemerkt  nun  erst  seine  ungeheure  Höhe,  da  er \r\nder  Maßstab  einer  so  großen  Menschenmasse  wird. \r\nDer  freie  Platz  läßt  dem  Auge  eine  schöne  Ruhe,  und \r\nman  sieht  die  leeren  Schranken  mit  dem  vorgespannten \r\nSeile  voller  Erwartung. \r\n\r\nNun  kommt  der  General  den  Corso  herab,  zum  Zeichen, \r\ndaß  er  gereiniget  ist,  und  hinter  ihm  erlaubt  die  Wache \r\nniemanden,  aus  der  Reihe  der  Kutschen  hervorzutreten. \r\nEr  nimmt  auf  einer  der  Logen  Platz. \r\n\r\nAbrennen \r\nNun  werden  die  Pferde  nach  geloseter  Ordnung  von  ge- \r\nputzten Stallknechten  in  die  Schranken  hinter  das  Seil \r\ngeführt.  Sie  haben  kein  Zeug,  noch  sonst  eine  Bedeckung \r\nauf  dem  Leibe.  Man  heftet  ihnen  hier  und  da  Stachel- \r\nkugeln mit  Schnüren  an  den  Leib  und  bedeckt  die  Stelle, \r\nwo  sie  spornen  sollen,  bis  zum  Augenblicke  mit  Leder; \r\nauch  klebt  man  ihnen  große  Blätter  Rauschgold  an. \r\nSie  sind  meist  schon  wild  und  ungeduldig,  wenn  sie  in \r\ndie  Schranken  gebracht  werden,  und  die  Reitknechte \r\nbrauchen  alle  Gewalt  und  Geschicklichkeit,  um  sie  zu- \r\nrückzuhalten. \r\n\r\nDie  Begierde,  den  Lauf  anzufangen,  macht  sie  unbändig, \r\ndie  Gegenwart  so  vieler  Menschen  macht  sie  scheu.  Sie \r\nhauen  oft  in  die  benachbarte  Schranke  hinüber,  oft  über \r\ndas  Seil,  und  diese  Bewegung  und  Unordnung  vermehrt \r\njeden  Augenblick  das  Interesse  der  Erwartung. \r\nDie  Stallknechte  sind  im  höchsten  Grade  gespannt  und \r\naufmerksam,  weil  in  dem  Augenblicke  des  Abrennens  die \r\n\r\n\r\n534  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nGeschicklichkeit  des  Loslassenden  sowie  zufällige  Um- \r\nstände zum  Vorteile  des  einen  oder  des  andern  Pferdes \r\nentscheiden  können. \r\n\r\nEndlich  fällt  das  Seil,  und  die  Pferde  rennen  los. \r\nAuf  dem  freien  Platze  suchen  sie  noch  einander  den  Vor- \r\nsprung\" abzugewinnen,  aber  wenn  sie  einmal  in  den  engen \r\nRaum  zwischen  die  beiden  Reihen  Kutschen  hineinkom- \r\nmen, wird  meist  aller  Wetteifer  vergebens. \r\nEin  paar  sind  gewöhnlich  voraus,  die  alle  Kräfte  an- \r\nstrengen. Ohngeachtet  der  gestreuten  Puzzolane  gibt  das \r\nPflaster  Feuer,  die  Mähnen  fliegen,  das  Rauschgold  rauscht, \r\nund  kaum  daß  man  sie  erblickt,  sind  sie  vorbei.  Die  üb- \r\nrige Herde  hindert  sich  untereinander,  indem  sie  sich \r\ndrängt  und  treibt;  spät  kommt  manchmal  noch  eins  nach- \r\ngesprengt, und  die  zerrissenen  Stücke  Rauschgold  flattern \r\neinzeln  auf  der  verlaßnen  Spur.  Bald  sind  die  Pferde  al- \r\nlem Nachschauen  verschwunden,  das  Volk  drängt  zu  und \r\nfüllt  die  Laufbahn  wieder  aus. \r\n\r\nSchon  warten  andere  Stallknechte  am  Venezianischen \r\nPalaste  auf  die  Ankunft  der  Pferde.  Man  weiß  sie  in  ei- \r\nnem eingeschlossenen  Bezirk  auf  gute  Art  zu  fangen  und \r\nfestzuhalten.  Dem  Sieger  wird  der  Preis  zuerkannt. \r\nSo  endigt  sich  diese  Feierlichkeit  mit  einem  gewaltsamen, \r\nblitzschnellen  augenblicklichen  Eindruck,  auf  den  so  viele \r\nlausend  Menschen  eine  ganze  Weile  gespannt  waren,  und \r\nwenige  können  sich  Rechenschaft  geben,  warum  sie  den \r\nMoment  erwarteten  und  warum  sie  sich  daran  ergötzten. \r\nNach  der  Folge  unserer  Beschreibung  sieht  man  leicht \r\nein,  daß  dieses  Spiel  den  Tieren  und  Menschen  gefähr- \r\nlich werden  könne.  Wir  wollen  nur  einige  Fälle  anfühi-en. \r\nBei  dem  engen  Räume  zwischen  den  Wagen  darf  nur \r\nein  Hinterrad  ein  wenig  herauswärts  stehen  und  zu- \r\nfälligerweise hinter  diesem  Wagen  ein  etwas  breiterer \r\nRaum  sein;  ein  Pferd,  das  mit  den  andern  gedrängt  her- \r\nbeieilt, sucht  den  erweiterten  Raum  zu  nutzen,  springt \r\nvor  und  trifft  gerade  auf  das  herausstehende  Rad. \r\nWir  haben  selbst  einen  Fall  gesehen,  wo  ein  Pferd  von \r\neinem  solchen  Chok  niederstürzte,  drei  der  folgenden \r\nüber  das  erste  hinausfielen,   sich  überschlutren  und  die \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  ROMISCHE  KARNEVAL  535 \r\n\r\nletzten  glücklich  über  die  gefallneu  wegsprangen  und  ihre \r\nReise  fortsetzten. \r\n\r\nOft  bleibt  ein  solches  Pferd  auf  der  Stelle  tot,  und  mehr- \r\nmals haben  Zuschauer  unter  solchen  Umständen  ihr  Le- \r\nben eingebüßt.  Ebenso  kann  ein  großes  Unheil  ent- \r\nstehen, wenn  die  Pferde  umkehren. \r\nEs  ist  vorgekommen,  daß  boshafte,  neidische  Menschen \r\neinem  Pferde,  das  einen  großen  Vorsprung  hatte,  mit  dem \r\nMantel  in  die  Augen  schlugen  und  es  dadurch  umzukeh- \r\nren und  an  die  Seite  zu  rennen  zwangen.  Noch  schlim- \r\nmer ist  es,  wenn  die  Pferde  auf  dem  Venezianischen \r\nPlatze  nicht  glücklich  aufgefangen  werden;  sie  kehren \r\nalsdann  unaufhaltsam  zurück,  und  weil  die  Laufbahn  vom \r\nVolke  schon  wieder  ausgefüllt  ist,  richten  sie  manches \r\nUnheil  an,  das  man  entweder  nicht  erfährt  oder  nicht \r\nachtet. \r\n\r\nAufgehobne  Ordnung \r\n\r\nGewöhnlich  laufen  die  Pferde  mit  einbrechender  Nacht \r\nerst  ab.  Sobald  sie  oben  bei  dem  Venezianischen  Palast \r\nangelangt  sind,  werden  kleine  Mörser  gelöst;  dieses  Zei- \r\nchen wird  in  der  Mitte  des  Corso  wiederholt  und  in  der \r\nGegend  des  Obelisken  das  letztemal  gegeben. \r\nIn  diesem  x\\ugenblicke  verläßt  die  Wache  ihren  Posten, \r\ndie  Ordnung  der  Kutschenreihen  wird  nicht  länger  ge- \r\nhalten, und  gewiß  ist  dieses  selbst  für  den  Zuschauer,  der \r\nruhig  an  seinem  Fenster  steht,  ein  ängstlicher  und  ver- \r\ndrießlicher Zeitpunkt,  und  es  ist  wert,  daß  man  einige \r\nBemerkungen  darüber  mache. \r\n\r\nWir  haben  schon  oben  gesehen,  daß  die  Epoche  der  ein- \r\nbrechenden Nacht,  welche  so  vieles  in  Italien  entschei- \r\ndet, auch  die  gewöhnlichen  sonn-  und  festtägigen  Spa- \r\nzierfahrten auflöset.  Dort  sind  keine  Wachen  und  keine \r\nGarden,  es  ist  ein  altes  Herkommen,  eine  allgemeine \r\nKonvention,  daß  man  in  gebührender  Ordnung  auf  und \r\nab  fahre;  aber  sobald  Ave  Maria  geläutet  wird,  läßt  sich \r\nniemand  sein  Recht  nehmen,  umzukehren,  wann  und  wie \r\ner  will.  Da  nun  die  Umfahrt  im  Karneval  in  derselben \r\nStraße  und  nach  ähnlichen  Gesetzen  geschieht,  obgleich \r\n\r\n\r\n536  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nhier  die  Menge  und  andere  Umstände  einen  großen  Un- \r\nterschied machen,  so  will  sich  doch  niemand  sein  Recht \r\nnehmen  lassen,  mit  einbrechender  Nacht  aus  der  Ord- \r\nnung zu  lenken. \r\n\r\nWenn  wir  nun  auf  das  ungeheure  Gedränge  in  dem  Corso \r\nzurückblicken  und  die  für  einen  Augenblick  nur  gerei- \r\nnigte Rennbahn  gleich  wieder  mit  Volk  überschwemmt \r\nsehen,  so  scheinet  uns  Vernunft  und  Billigkeit  das  Gesetz \r\neinzugeben,  daß  eine  jede  Equipage  nur  suchen  solle,  in \r\nihrer  Ordnung  das  nächste  ihr  bequeme  Gäßchen  zu  er- \r\nreichen und  so  nach  Hause  zu  eilen. \r\nAllein  es  lenken,  gleich  nach  abgeschoßnen  Signalen,  ei- \r\nnige Wagen  in  die  Mitte  hinein,  hemmen  und  verwirren \r\ndas  Fußvolk,  und  weil  in  dem  engen  Mittelraume  es  ei- \r\nnem einfällt,  hinunter-,  dem  andern  hinaufzufahren,  so \r\nkönnen  beide  nicht  von  der  Stelle  und  hindern  oft  die \r\nVernünftigem,  die  in  der  Reihe  geblieben  sind,  auch  vom \r\nPlatz  zu  kommen. \r\n\r\nWenn  nun  gar  ein  zurückkehrendes  Pferd  auf  einen  sol- \r\nchen Knoten  trifft,  so  vermehrt  sich  Gefahr,  Unheil  und \r\nVerdruß  von  allen  Seiten. \r\n\r\nNacht \r\n\r\nUnd  doch  entwickelt  sich  diese  Verwirrung,  zwar  später, \r\naber  meistens  glücklich.  Die  Nacht  ist  eingetreten,  und \r\nein  jedes  wünscht  sich  zu  einiger  Ruhe  Glück. \r\n\r\nTheater \r\n\r\nAlle  Gesichtsmasken  sind  von  dem  Augenblick  an  abge- \r\nlegt, und  ein  großer  Teil  des  Publikums  eilt  nach  dem \r\nTheater.  Nur  in  den  Logen  sieht  man  allenfalls  noch \r\nTabarros  und  Damen  in  Maskenkleidern;  das  ganze  Par- \r\nterre zeigt  sich  wieder  in  bürgerlicher  Tracht. \r\nDie  Theater  Aliberti  und  Argentina  geben  ernsthafte \r\nOpern  mit  eingeschobenen  Balletten;  Valle  und  Capra- \r\nnica  Komödien  und  Tragödien  mit  komischen  Opern  als \r\nIntermezzo;  Pace  ahmt  ihnen,  wiewohl  unvollkommen, \r\nnach,  und  so  gibt  es,  bis  zum  Puppenspiel  und  zur  Seil- \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  5  3  7 \r\n\r\ntänzerbude  herunter,  noch  manche  subordinierte  Schau- \r\nspiele. \r\n\r\nDas  große  Theater  Tordenone,  das  einmal  abbrannte  und, \r\nda  man  es  wieder  aufgebauet  hatte,  gleich  zusammen- \r\nstürzte, unterhält  nun  leider  das  Volk  nicht  mehr  mit  sei- \r\nnen Haupt-  und  Staatsaktionen  und  andern  wunderbaren \r\nVorstellungen. \r\n\r\nDie  Leidenschaft  der  Römer  für  das  Theater  ist  groß  und \r\nwar  ehemals  in  der  Karnevalszeit  noch  heftiger,  weil  sie \r\nin  dieser  einzigen  Epoche  befriedigt  werden  konnte.  Ge- \r\ngenwärtig ist  wenigstens  ei?i  Schauspielhaus  auch  im  Som- \r\nmer und  Herbst  ofien,  und  das  Publikum  kann  seine  Lust \r\nden  größten  Teil  des  Jahres  durch  einigermaßen  befrie- \r\ndigen. \r\n\r\nEs  würde  uns  hier  zu  sehr  von  unserm  Zwecke  abführen, \r\nwenn  wir  uns  in  eine  umständliche  Beschreibung  der  The- \r\nater, und  was  die  römischen  allenfalls  Besonderes  haben \r\nmöchten,  hier  einlassen  wollten.  Unsre  Leser  erinnern \r\nsich,  daß  an  andern  Orten  von  diesem  Gegenstande  ge- \r\nhandelt worden. \r\n\r\nFestine \r\n\r\nGleichfalls  werden  wir  von  den  sogenannten  Festinen \r\nwenig  zu  erzählen  haben;  es  sind  dieses  große  maskierte \r\nBälle,  welche  in  dem  schön  erleuchteten  Theater  Aliberti \r\neinigemal  gegeben  werden. \r\n\r\nAuch  hier  werden  Tabarros  sowohl  von  den  Herren  als \r\nDamen  für  die  anständigste  Maske  gehalten,  und  der  ganze \r\nSaal  ist  mit  schwarzen  Figuren  angefüllt;  wenige  bunte \r\nCharaktermasken  mischen  sich  drunter. \r\nDesto  größer  ist  die  Neugierde,  wenn  sich  einige  edle  Ge- \r\nstalten zeigen,  die,  wiewohl  seltener,  aus  den  verschie- \r\ndenen Kunstepochen  ihre  INIasken  erwählen  und  ver- \r\nschiedene Statuen,  welche  sich  in  Rom  befinden,  meister- \r\nlich nachahmen. \r\n\r\nSo  zeigen  sich  hier  ägyptische  Gottheiten,  Priesterinnen, \r\nBacchus  und  ^Ariadne,  die  tragische  Muse,  die  Muse  der \r\nGeschichte,  eine  Stadt,  Vestalinnen,  ein  Konsul,  mehr  oder \r\nweniger  gut  und  nach  dem  Kostüme  ausgeführt. \r\n\r\n\r\n538  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nTanz \r\nDie  Tänze  bei  diesen  Festen  werden  gewöhnlich  in  langen \r\nReihen,  nach  Art  der  englischen,  getanzt;  nur  unterschei- \r\nden sie  sich  dadurch,  daß  sie  in  ihren  wenigen  Touren \r\nmeistenteils  etwas  Charakteristisches  pantomimisch  aus- \r\ndrücken: zum  Beispiel  es  entzweien  und  versöhnen  sich \r\nzwei  Liebende,  sie  scheiden  und  finden  sich  wieder. \r\nDie  Römer  sind  durch  die  pantomimischen  Ballette  an \r\nstark  gezeichnete  Gestikulation  gewöhnt;  sie  lieben  auch \r\nin  ihren  gesellschaftlichen  Tänzen  einen  Ausdruck,  der  uns \r\nübertrieben  und  aflektiert  scheinen  würde.  Niemand  wagt \r\nleicht  zu  tanzen,  als  wer  es  kunstmäßig  gelernt  hat;  be- \r\nsonders wird  der  Menuet  ganz  eigentlich  als  ein  Kunst- \r\nwerk betrachtet  und  nur  von  wenigen  Paaren  gleichsam \r\naufgeführt.  Ein  solches  Paar  wird  dann  von  der  übrigen \r\nGesellschaft  ineinenKreis  eingeschlossen,  bewundert  und \r\nam  Ende  applaudiert. \r\n\r\nMorgen \r\nWenn  die  galante  Welt  sich  auf  diese  Weise  bis  an  den \r\nMorgen  erlustiget,  so  ist  man  bei  anbrechendem  Tage \r\nschon  wieder  in  dem  Corso  beschäftiget,  denselben  zu \r\nreinigen  und  in  Ordnung  zu  bringen.  Besonders  sorgt \r\nman,  daß  die  Puzzolane  in  der  Mitte  der  Straße  gleich \r\nund  reinlich  ausgebreitet  werde. \r\n\r\nNicht  lange,  so  bringen  die  Stallknechte  das  Rennpferd, \r\ndas  sich  gestern  am  schlechtesten  gehalten,  vor  den  Obelisk, \r\nMan  setzt  einen  kleinen  Knaben  darauf,  und  ein  anderer \r\nReiter,  mit  einer  Peitsche,  treibt  es  vor  sich  her,  so  daß \r\nes  alle  seine  Kräfte  anstrengt,  um  seine  Bahn  so  geschwind \r\nals  möglich  zurückzulegen. \r\n\r\nUngefähr  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag,  nach  dem  gegebenen \r\nGlockenzeichen,  beginnt  jeden  Tagder  schon  beschriebene \r\nZirkel  des  Festes.  Die  Spaziergänger  finden  sich  ein,  die \r\nWache  zieht  auf,  Balkone,  Fenster,  Gerüste  werden  mit \r\nTeppichen  behängt,  die  Masken  vermehren  sich  und  trei- \r\nben ihre  Torheiten,  die  Kutschen  fahren  auf  und  nieder, \r\nund  die  Straße  ist  mehr  oder  weniger  gedrängt,  je  nach- \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  539 \r\n\r\ndem  die  Witterung  oder  andere  Umstände  günstig  oder  un- \r\ngünstig ihren  Einfluß  zeigen.  Gegen  das  Ende  des  Karne- \r\nvals vermehren  sich,  wie  natürlich,  die  Zuschauer,  die  Mas- \r\nken, die  Wagen,  der  Putz  und  der  Lärm.  Nichts  aber  reicht \r\nan  das  Gedränge,  an  die  Ausschweifungen  des  letzten  Ta- \r\nges und  Abends. \r\n\r\nLetzter  Tag \r\nMeist  halten  die  Kutschenreihen  schon  zwei  Stunden  vor \r\nNacht  stille:  kein  Wagen  kann  mehr  von  der  Stelle,  keiner \r\naus  den  Seitengassen  mehr  hereinrücken.  Die  Gerüste \r\nund  Stühle  sind  früher  besetzt,  obgleich  die  Plätze  teurer \r\ngehalten  werden ;  jeder  sucht  aufs  baldigste  unterzukommen, \r\nund  man  erwartet  das  Ablaufen  der  Pferde  mit  mehrerer \r\nSehnsucht  als  jemals. \r\n\r\nEndlich  rauscht  auch  dieser  Augenblick  vorbei,  die  Zei- \r\nchen werden  gegeben,  daß  das  Fest  geendigt  sei;  allein \r\nweder  Wagen  noch  Masken  noch  Zuschauer  weichen  aus \r\nder  Stelle. \r\n\r\nAlles  ist  ruhig,  alles  still,  indem  die  Dämmerung  sachte \r\nzunimmt. \r\n\r\nMoccoli \r\nKaum  wird  es  in  der  engen  und  hohen  Straße  düster,  so \r\nsiehet  man  hie  und  da  Lichter  erscheinen,  an  den  Fen- \r\nstern, auf  den  Gerüsten  sich  bewegen  und  in  kurzer  Zeit \r\ndie  Zirkulation  des  Feuers  dergestalt  sich  verbreiten, \r\ndaß  die  ganze  Straße  von  brennenden  Wachskerzen  er- \r\nleuchtet ist. \r\n\r\nDie  Balkone  sind  mit  durchscheinenden  Papierlaternen \r\nverziert,  jeder  hält  seine  Kerze  zum  Fenster  heraus,  alle \r\nGerüste  sind  erhellt,  und  es  sieht  sich  gar  artig  in  die \r\nKutschen  hinein,  an  deren  Decken  oft  kleine  kristallne \r\nArmleuchter  die  Gesellschaft  erhellen,  indessen  in  einem \r\nandern  Wagen  die  Damen  mit  bunten  Kerzen  in  den  Hän- \r\nden zur  Betrachtung  ihi-er  Schönheit  gleichsam  einzuladen \r\nscheinen. \r\n\r\nDie  Bedienten  bekleben  den  Rand  des  Kutscliendeckels \r\nmit  Kerzrhen;    offne  Wagen   mit   bunten  Papierlaternen \r\n\r\n\r\n540  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nzeigen  sich;  unter  den  Fußgängern  erscheinen  manche  mit \r\nhohen  Lichterpyramiden  auf  den  Köpfen,  andere  haben \r\nihr  Licht  auf  zusammengebundene  Rohre  gesteckt  und  er- \r\nreichen mit  einer  solchen  Rute  oft  die  Höhe  von  zwei, \r\ndrei  Stockwerken. \r\n\r\nNun  wird  es  für  einen  jeden  Pflicht,  ein  angezündetes  Kerz- \r\nchen in  der  Hand  zu  tragen,  und  die  Favoritverwünschung \r\nder  Römer:  Sia  ammazzato!  hört  man  von  allen  Ecken  und \r\nEnden  wiederholen.  Sia  ammazzato  chi  non  porta  moc- \r\ncolo!  Ermordet  werde,  der  kein  Lic/itstiunpfc/ieti  tragt!  ruft \r\neiner  dem  andern  zu,  indem  er  ihm  das  Licht  auszublasen \r\nsucht.  Anzünden  und  Ausblasen  und  ein  unbändiges  Ge- \r\nschrei: Sia  ammazzato!  bringt  nun  bald  Leben  und  Be- \r\nwegung und  wechselseitiges  Interesse  unter  die  ungeheure \r\nMenge. \r\n\r\nOhne  Unterschied,  ob  man  Bekannte  oder  Unbekannte \r\nvor  sich  habe,  sucht  man  nur  immer  das  nächste  Licht \r\nauszublasen  oder  das  seinige  wieder  anzuzünden  und  bei \r\ndieser  Gelegenheit  das  Licht  des  Anzündenden  auszu- \r\nlöschen. Und  je  stärker  das  Gebrüll:  Sia  ammazzato!  von \r\nallen  Enden  widerhallt,  desto  mehr  verliert  das  Wort  von \r\nseinem  fürchterlichen  Sinn,  desto  mehr  vergißt  man,  daß \r\nman  in  Rom  sei,  wo  diese  Verwünschung  um  einer  Klei- \r\nnigkeit willen  in  kurzem  an  einem  und  dem  andern  erfüllt \r\nwerden  kann. \r\n\r\nDie  Bedeutung  des  Ausdrucks  verliert  sich  nach  und  nach \r\ngänzlich.  Und  wie  wir  in  andern  Sprachen  oft  Flüche  und \r\nunanständige  Worte  zum  Zeichen  der  Bewunderung  und \r\nFreude  gebrauchen  hören,  so  wird  Sia  ammazzato!  diesen \r\nAbend  zum  Losungswort,  zum  Freudengeschrei,  zum  Re- \r\nfrain aller  Scherze,  Neckereien  und  Komplimente. \r\nSo  hören  wir  spotten:  Sia  ammazzato  il  Signore  Abbate \r\nche  fa  l'amore!  oder  einen  vorbeigehenden  guten  Freund \r\nanrufen:  Sia  ammazzato  il  Signore  Filippo!  oder  Schmei- \r\nchelei und  Komplimente  damit  verbinden:  Sia  ammazzata \r\nla  bella  Principessa!  Sia  ammazzata  la  Signora  Angelica, \r\nla  prima  pittrice  dei  secolo! \r\n\r\nAlle  diese  Phrasen  werden  heftig  und  schnell  mit  einem \r\nlangen  haltenden  Ton  auf  der  vorletzten  oder  drittletzten \r\n\r\n\r\nDAS  RÖMISCHE  KARNEVAL  541 \r\n\r\nSilbe  ausgerufen.  Unter  diesem  unaufhörlichen  Geschrei \r\ngeht  das  Ausblasen  und  Anzünden  der  Kerzen  immer  fort. \r\nMan  begegne  jemanden  im  Haus,  auf  der  Treppe,  es  sei \r\neine  Gesellschaft  imZimmerbeisammen,auseinemFenster \r\nans  benachbarte,  überall  sucht  man  über  den  andern  zu \r\ngewinnen  und  ihm  das  Licht  auszulöschen. \r\nAlle  Stände  und  Alter  toben  gegeneinander,  man  steigt \r\nauf  die  Tritte  der  Kutschen,  kein  Hängeleuchter,  kaum \r\ndie  Laternen  sind  sicher,  der  Knabe  löscht  dem  Vater \r\ndas  Licht  aus  und  hört  nicht  auf  zu  schreien:  Sia  ammazzato \r\nil  Signore  Padre!  Vergebens,  daß  ihm  der  Alte  diese  Un- \r\nanständigkeit verweist;  der  Knabe  behauptet  die  Freiheit \r\ndieses  Abends  und  verwünscht  nur  seinen  Vater  desto \r\närger.  Wie  nun  an  beiden  Enden  des  Corso  sich  bald \r\ndas  Getümmel  verliert,  desto  unbändiger  häuft  sichs  nach \r\nder  Mitte  zu,  und  dort  entsteht  ein  Gedränge,  das  alle  Be- \r\ngriffe übersteigt,  ja  das  selbst  die  lebhafteste  Erinnerungs- \r\nkraft sich  nicht  wieder  vergegenwärtigen  kann. \r\nNiemand  vermag  sich  mehr  von  dem  Platze,  wo  er  steht \r\noder  sitzt,  zu  rühren;  die  Wärme  so  vieler  Menschen,  so \r\nvieler  Lichter,  der  Dampf  so  vieler  immer  wieder  aus- \r\ngeblasenen Kerzen,  das  Geschrei  so  vieler  Menschen, \r\ndie  nur  um  desto  heftiger  brüllen,  je  weniger  sie  ein \r\nGlied  rühren  können,  machen  zuletzt  selbst  den  gesund- \r\nsten Sinn  schwindeln;  es  scheint  unmöglich,  daß  nicht \r\nmanches  Unglück  geschehe,  daß  die  Kutschpferde  nicht \r\nwild,  nicht  mancher  gequetscht,  gedrückt  oder  sonst  be- \r\nschädigt werden  sollte. \r\n\r\nUnd  doch,  weil  sich  endlich  jeder  weniger  oder  mehr \r\nhinwegsehnt,  jeder  einGäßchen,  an  das  er  gelangen  kann, \r\neinschlägt  oder  auf  dem  nächsten  Platze  freie  Luft  und \r\nErholung  sucht,  löst  sich  diese  Masse  auch  auf,  schmilzt \r\nvon  den  Enden  nach  der  Mitte  zu,  und  dieses  Fest  all- \r\ngemeiner Freiheit  und  Losgebundenheit,  dieses  moderne \r\nSaturnal,  endigt  sich  mit  einer  allgemeinen  Betäubung. \r\nDas  Volk  eilt  nun,  sich  bei  einem  wohlbereiteten  Schmause \r\nan  dem  bald  verbotenen  Fleische  bis  Mitternacht  zu  er- \r\ngötzen, die  feinere  Welt  nach  den  Schauspielhäusern,  um \r\ndort  von  den  sehr  abgekürzten  Theaterstücken  Abschied \r\n\r\n\r\n542  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nzu  nehmen;   und  auch  diesen  Freuden  macht  die  heran- \r\nnahende Mitternachtsstunde  ein  Ende. \r\n\r\nAschermittwoch \r\nSo  ist  denn  ein  ausschweifendes  Fest  wie  ein  Traum, \r\nwie  ein  Märchen  vorüber,  und  es  bleibt  dem  Teilnehmer \r\nvielleicht  weniger  davon  in  der  Seele  zurück  als  unsern \r\nLesern,  vor  deren  Einbildungskraft  und  Verstand  wir  das \r\nGanze  in  seinem  Zusammenhange  gebracht  haben. \r\nWenn  uns  während  dem  Lauf  dieser  Torheiten  der  rohe \r\nPulcinell  ungebührlich  an  die  Freuden  der  Liebe  erinnert, \r\ndenen  wir  unser  Dasein  zu  danken  haben,  wenn  eine  Baubo \r\nauf  ööentlichem  Platze  die  Geheimnisse  der  Gebärerin \r\nentweiht,  wenn  so  viele  nächtlich  angezündete  Kerzen \r\nuns  an  die  letzte  Feierlichkeit  erinnern,  so  werden  wir \r\nmitten  unter  dem  Unsinne  auf  die  wichtigsten  Szenen \r\nunsers  Lebens  aufmerksam  gemacht. \r\nNoch  mehr  erinnert  uns  die  schmale,  lange,  gedrängt \r\nvolle  Straße  an  die  Wege  des  Weltlebens,  wo  jeder  Zu- \r\nschauer und  Teilnehmer  mit  freiem  Gesicht  oder  unter \r\nder  Maske,  vom  Balkon  oder  vom  Gerüste  nur  einen  ge- \r\nringen Raum  vor  und  neben  sich  übersieht,  in  der  Kut- \r\nsche oder  zu  Fuße  nur  Schritt  für  Schritt  vorwärts  kommt, \r\nmehr  geschoben  wird  als  geht,  mehr  aufgehalten  wird  als \r\nwillig  stille  steht,  nur  eifriger  dahin  zu  gelangen  sucht,  wo \r\nes  besser  und  froher  zugeht,  und  dann  auch  da  wieder  in \r\ndie  Enge  kommt  und  zuletzt  verdrängt  wird. \r\nDürfen  wir  fortfahren,  ernsthafter  zu  sprechen,  als  es  der \r\nGegenstand  zu  erlauben  scheint,  so  bemerken  wir:  daß \r\ndie  lebhaftesten  und  höchsten  Vergnügen  wie  die  vorbei- \r\nfliegenden Pferde  nur  einen  Augenblick  uns  erscheinen, \r\nuns  rühren  und  kaum  eine  Spur  in  der  Seele  zurücklassen, \r\ndaß  Freiheit  und  Gleichheit  nur  in  dem  Taumel  des  Wahn- \r\nsinns genossen  werden  können  und  daß  die  größte  Lust \r\nnur  dann  am  höchsten  reizt,  wenn  sie  sich  ganz  nahe  an \r\ndie  Gefahr  drängt  und  lüstern  ängstlich- süße  Empfin- \r\ndungen in  ihrer  Nähe  genießet. \r\n\r\nUnd  so  hätten  wir,  ohne  selbst  daran  zu  denken,  auch \r\nunserKarnevalmit  einer  Aschermittwochsbetrachtung  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  543 \r\n\r\nschlössen,  wodurch  wir  keinen  unsrer  Leser  traurig  zu \r\nmachen  fürchten.  Vielmehr  wünschen  wir,  daß  jeder  mit \r\nuns,  da  das  Leben  im  ganzen,  wie  das  römische  Karne- \r\nval, unübersehlich,  ungenießbar,  ja  bedenklich  bleibt, \r\ndurch  diese  unbekümmerte  Maskengesellschaft  an  die \r\nWichtigkeit  jedes  augenblicklichen,  oft  gering  scheinenden \r\nLebensgenusses  erinnert  werden  möge. \r\n\r\nP'ebruar \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  I.  Februar. \r\n\r\nWIE  froh  will  ich  sein,  wenn  die  Narren  künftigen \r\nDienstag  abend  zur  Ruhe  gebracht  werden.  Es \r\nist  eine  entsetzliche  Sekkatur,  andere  toll  zu  sehen,  wenn \r\nman  nicht  selbst  angesteckt  ist. \r\n\r\nSo  viel,  als  möglich  war,  habe  ich  meine  Studien  fort- \r\ngesetzt, auch  ist  Claudine  gerückt,  und  wenn  nicht  alle \r\nGenii  ihre  Hülfe  versagen,  so  geht  heute  über  acht  Tage \r\nder  dritte  Akt  an  Herdern  ab,  und  so  wäre  ich  den  fünf- \r\nten Band  los.  Dann  geht  eine  neue  Not  au,  worin  mir \r\nniemand  raten  noch  helfen  kann.  Tasso  muß  umgearbeitet \r\nwerden:  was  da  steht,  ist  zu  nichts  zu  brauchen;  ich  kann \r\nweder  so  endigen  noch  alles  wegwerfen.  Solche  Mühe \r\nhat  Gott  den  Menschen  gegeben! \r\n\r\nDer  sechste  Band  enthält  wahrscheinlich  Tasso,  Lila,  Jery \r\nund  Bätely,  alles  um-  und  ausgearbeitet,  daß  man  es  nicht \r\nmehr  kennen  soll. \r\n\r\nZugleich  habe  ich  meine  kleinen  Gedichte  durchgesehen \r\nund  an  den  achten  Band  gedacht,  den  ich  vielleicht  vor \r\ndem  siebenten  herausgebe.  Es  ist  ein  wunderlich  Ding, \r\nso  ein  Summa  Summarum  seines  Lebens  zu  ziehen.  Wie \r\nwenig  Spur  bleibt  doch  von  einer  Existenz  zurück! \r\nHier  sekkieren  sie  mich  mit  den  Übersetzungen  meines \r\nWerthers  und  zeigen  mir  sie  und  fragen,  welches  die  beste \r\nsei,  und  ob  auch  alles  wahr  sei!  Das  ist  nun  ein  Unheil, \r\nwas  mich  bis  nach  Indien  verfolgen  würde. \r\n\r\nDe7i  6.  Februar. \r\nHier  ist  der  dritte  Akt  Claudinens;  ich  wünsche,  daß  er \r\n\r\n\r\n544  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  IH \r\n\r\ndir  nur  die  Hälfte  so  wohl  gefallen  möge,  als  ich  ver- \r\ngnügt bin,  ihn  geendigt  zu  haben.  Da  ich  nun  die  Be- \r\ndürfnisse des  lyrischen  Theaters  genauer  kenne,  habe  ich \r\ngesucht  durch  manche  Aufopferungen  dem  Komponisten \r\nund  Akteur  entgegen  zu  arbeiten.  Das  Zeug,  worauf  ge- \r\nstickt werden  soll,  muß  weite  Fäden  haben,  und  zu  einer \r\nkomischen  Oper  muß  es  absolut  wie  Marli  gewoben  sein. \r\nDoch  hab  ich  bei  dieser,  wie  bei  Erwin,  auch  fürs  Lesen \r\ngesorgt.  Genug,  ich  habe  getan,  was  ich  konnte. \r\nIch  bin  recht  still  und  rein  und,  wie  ich  euch  schon  ver- \r\nsichert habe,  jedem  Ruf  bereit  und  ergeben.  Zur  bilden- \r\nden Kunst  bin  ich  zu  alt;  ob  ich  also  ein  bißchen  mehr \r\noder  weniger  pfusche,  ist  eins.  Mein  Durst  ist  gestillt, \r\nauf  dem  rechten  Wege  bin  ich  der  Betrachtung  und  des \r\nStudiums,  mein  Genuß  ist  friedlich  und  genügsam.  Zu \r\ndem  allen  gebt  mir  euern  Segen.  Ich  habe  nichts  Nähe- \r\nres nun,  als  meine  drei  letzten  Teile  zu  endigen.  Dann \r\nSolls  an  Wilhelm  usw. \r\n\r\nDen  g.  Februar. \r\nDie  Narren  haben  noch  Montag  und  Dienstag  was  Rechts \r\ngelärmt.  Besonders  Dienstag  abends,  wo  die  Raserei  mit \r\nden  Moccoli  in  völligem  Flor  war.  Mittwochs  dankte  man \r\nGott  und  der  Kirche  für  die  Fasten.  Auf  kein  Festin — \r\nso  nennen  sie  die  Redouten- — bin  ich  gekommen;  ich  bin \r\nfleißig,  was  nur  mein  Kopf  halten  will.  Da  der  fünfte \r\nBand  absolviert  ist,  will  ich  nur  einige  Kunststudien  durch- \r\narbeiten, dann  gleich  an  den  sechsten  gehn.  Ich  habe \r\ndiese  Tage  das  Buch  Leonards  da  Vinci  über  die  Ma- \r\nlerei gelesen  und  begreife  jetzt,  warum  ich  nie  etwas \r\ndarin  habe  begreifen  können. \r\n\r\nO  wie  finde  ich  die  Zuschauer  so  glücklich!  die  dünken \r\nsich  so  klug,  sie  finden  sich  was  Rechts.  So  auch  die \r\nLiebhaber,  die  Kenner.  Du  glaubst  nicht,  was  das  ein \r\nbehagliches  Volk,  indes  der  gute  Künstler  immer  klein- \r\nlaut bleibt.  Ich  habe  aber  auch  neuerdings  einen  Ekel, \r\njemanden  urteilen  zu  hören,  der  nicht  selbst  arbeitet,  daß \r\nich  es  nicht  ausdrücken  kann.  Wie  der  Tabaksdampf  macht \r\nmich  eine  solche  Rede  auf  der  Stelle  unbehaglich. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  545 \r\n\r\nAngelica  hat  sich  das  Vergnügen  gemacht  und  zwei  Ge- \r\nmälde gekauft,  eins  von  Tizian,  das  andere  von  Paris \r\nBourdon.  Beide  um  einen  hohen  Preis.  Da  sie  so  reich \r\nist,  daß  sie  ihre  Renten  nicht  verzehrt  und  jährlich  mehr \r\ndazu  verdient,  so  ist  es  lobenswürdig,  daß  sie  etwas  an- \r\nschafft, das  ihr  Freude  macht,  und  solche  Sachen,  die \r\nihren  Kunsteifer  erhöhen.  Gleich  sobald  sie  die  Bilder \r\nim  Hause  hatte,  fing  sie  an,  in  einer  neuen  Manier  zu \r\nmalen,  um  zu  versuchen,  wie  man  gewisse  Vorteile  jener \r\nMeister  sich  eigen  machen  könne.  Sie  ist  unermüdet, \r\nnicht  allein  zu  arbeiten,  sondern  auch  zu  studieren.  Mit \r\nihr  ists  eine  große  Freude  Kunstsachen  zu  sehen. \r\nKayser  geht  auch  als  ein  wackrer  Künstler  zu  Werke. \r\nSeine  Musik  zu  Egmont  avanciert  stark.  Noch  habe  ich \r\nnicht  alles  gehört.  Mir  scheint  jedes  dem  Endzweck  sehr \r\nangemessen. \r\n\r\nEr  wird  auch  \"Cupido,  kleiner,  loser  usw.\"  komponieren. \r\nIch  schicke  dirs  gleich,  damit  es  oft  zu  meinem  Andenken \r\ngesungen  werde.  Es  ist  auch  mein  Leibliedchen. \r\nDer  Kopf  ist  mir  wüste  vom  vielen  Schreiben,  Treiben \r\nund  Denken.  Ich  werde  nicht  klüger,  fordere  zu  viel  von \r\nmir  und  lege  mir  zu  viel  auf. \r\n\r\nDen  16.  Februar. \r\nMit  dem  preußischen  Kurier  erhielt  ich  vor  einiger  Zeit \r\neinen  Brief  von  unserm  Herzog,  der  so  freundlich,  lieb, \r\ngut  und  erfreulich  war,  als  ich  nicht  leicht  einen  erhal- \r\nten. Da  er  ohne  Rückhalt  schreiben  konnte,  so  beschrieb \r\ner  mir  die  ganze  politische  Lage,  die  seinige  und  so \r\nweiter.  Über  mich  selbst  erklärte  er  sich  auf  das  lieb- \r\nreichste. \r\n\r\nDen  23.  Februar. \r\nWir  haben  diese  Woche  einen  Fall  gehabt,  der  das  ganze \r\nChor  der  Künstler  in  Betrübnis  setzt.  Ein  Franzose  na- \r\nmens Drouais,  ein  junger  Mensch  von  etwa  25  Jahren, \r\neinziger  Sohn  einer  zärtlichen  Mutter,  reich  und  schön \r\ngebildet,  der  unter  allen  studierenden  Künstlern  für  den \r\nhofinungsvollsten  gehalten  ward,  ist  an  den  Blattern  ge- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  35 \r\n\r\n\r\n546  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  HI \r\n\r\nsterben.  Es  ist  eine  allgemeine  Trauer  und  Bestürzung. \r\nIch  habe  in  seinem  verlassenen  Studio  die  lebensgroße \r\nFigur  eines  Philoktets  gesehen,  welcher  mit  einem  Flü- \r\ngel eines  erlegten  Raubvogels  den  Schmerz  seiner  Wunde \r\nwehend  kühlt.  Ein  schön  gedachtes  Bild,  das  in  der \r\nAusführung  viel  Verdienste  hat,  aber  nicht  fertig  ge- \r\nworden. \r\n\r\nIch  bin  fleißig  und  vergnügt  und  erwarte  so  die  Zukunft. \r\nTäglich  wird  mirs  deutlicher,  daß  ich  eigentlich  zur  Dicht- \r\nkunst geboren  bin,  und  daß  ich  die  nächsten  zehen  Jahre, \r\ndie  ich  höchstens  noch  arbeiten  darf,  dieses  Talent  ex- \r\nkolieren  und  noch  etwas  Gutes  machen  sollte,  da  mir \r\ndas  Feuer  der  Jugend  manches  ohne  großes  Studium  ge- \r\nlingen ließ.  Von  meinem  längern  Aufenthalt  in  Rom \r\nwerde  ich  den  Vorteil  haben,  daß  ich  auf  das  Ausüben \r\nder  bildenden  Kunst  Verzicht  tue. \r\n\r\nAngelica  macht  mir  das  Kompliment,  daß  sie  wenige  in \r\nRom  kenne,  die  besser  in  der  Kunst  sähe7i  als  ich.  Ich \r\nweiß  recht  gut,  wo  und  was  ich  noch  nicht  sehe,  und \r\nfühle  wohl,  daß  ich  immer  zunehme,  und  was  zu  tun  wäre, \r\num  immer  weiter  zu  sehn.  Genug,  ich  habe  schon  jetzt \r\nmeinen  Wunsch  erreicht:  in  einer  Sache,  zu  der  ich \r\nmich  leidenschaftlich  getragen  fühle,  nicht  mehr  blind  zu \r\ntappen. \r\n\r\nEin  Gedicht,  Amor  als  Landschaftsmaler,  schick  ich  dir \r\nehstens  und  wünsche  ihm  gut  Glück.  Meine  kleinen  Ge- \r\ndichte hab  ich  gesucht  in  eine  gewisse  Ordnung  zu  brin- \r\ngen, sie  nehmen  sich  wunderlich  aus.  Die  Gedichte  auf \r\nHans  Sachs  und  auf  Miedings  Tod  schHeßen  den  achten \r\nBand  und  so  meine  Schriften  für  diesmal.  Wenn  sie  mich \r\nindessen  bei  der  Pyramide  zur  Ruhe  bringen,  so  können \r\ndiese  beiden  Gedichte  statt  Personalien  und  Parentation \r\ngelten. \r\n\r\nMorgen  frühe  ist  päpstliche  Kapelle,  und  die  famosen  al- \r\nten Musiken  fangen  an,  die  nachher  in  der  Karwoche  auf \r\nden  höchsten  Grad  des  Interesse  steigen.  Ich  will  nun \r\njeden  Sonntag  frühe  hin,  um  mit  dem  Stil  bekannt  zu  wer- \r\nden. Kayser,  der  diese  Sachen  eigentlich  studiert,  wird \r\nmir  den  Sinn  wohl  darüber  aufschließen.    Wir  erwarten \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  547 \r\n\r\nmit  jeder  Post  ein  gedrucktes  Exemplar  der  Gründonners- \r\ntagsrausik  von  Zürich,  wo  sie  Kayser  zurückließ.  Sie  wird \r\nalsdann  erst  am  Klavier  gespielt  und  dann  in  der  Ka- \r\npelle gehört. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\nFebruar \r\n\r\nWenn  man  einmal  zum  Künstler  geboren  ist  und  gar \r\nmancher  Gegenstand  der  Kunstanschauung  zusagt,  so  kam \r\ndiese  mir  auch  mitten  unter  dem  Gewühl  der  Fastnachts- \r\ntorheiten und  Absurditäten  zu  Gunsten.  Es  war  das  zweite \r\nMal,  daß  ich  das  Karneval  sah,  und  es  mußte  mir  bald \r\nauffallen,  daß  dieses  Volksfest,  wie  ein  anderes  wieder- \r\nkehrendes Leben  und  Weben,  seinen  entschiedenen  Ver- \r\nlauf hatte. \r\n\r\nDadiurch  ward  ich  nun  mit  dem  Getümmel  versöhnt,  ich \r\nsah  es  an  als  ein  anderes  bedeutendes  Naturerzeugnis  und \r\nNationalereignis;  ich  interessierte  mich  dafür  in  diesem \r\nSinne,  bemerkte  genau  den  Gang  der  Torheiten,  und  wie \r\ndas  alles  doch  in  einer  gewissen  Form  und  Schicklichkeit \r\nablief.  Hierauf  notierte  ich  mir  die  einzelnen  Vorkomm- \r\nnisse der  Reihe  nach,  welche  Vorarbeit  ich  später  zu  dem \r\nsoeben  eingeschalteten  Aufsatz  benutzte,  bat  auch  zu- \r\ngleich unsern  Hausgenossen  Georg  Schütz,  die  einzelnen \r\nMasken  flüchtig  zu  zeichnen  und  zu  kolorieren,  welches \r\ner  mit  seiner  gewohnten  Gefälligkeit  durchführte. \r\nDiese  Zeichnungen  wurden  nachher  durch  Melchior  Kraus \r\nvon  Frankfurt  am  Main,  Direktor  des  freien  Zeichenin- \r\nstituts zu  Weimar,  in  Quarto  radiert  und  nach  den  Ori- \r\nginalen illuminiert  zur  ersten  Ausgabe  bei  Unger,  welche \r\nsich  selten  macht. \r\n\r\nZu  vorgemeldeten  Zwecken  mußte  man  sich  denn  mehr, \r\nals  sonst  geschehen  wäre,  unter  die  verkappte  Menge \r\nhinunterdrängen,  welche  denn  trotz  aller  künstlerischen \r\nAnsicht  oft  einen  widerwärtigen,  unheimlichen  Eindruck \r\nmachte.  Der  Geist,  an  die  würdigen  Gegenstände  ge- \r\nwöhnt, mit  denen  man  das  ganze  Jahr  in  Rom  sich  be- \r\nschäftigte, schien  immer  einmal  gewahr  zu  werden,  daß \r\ner  nicht  recht  an  seinem  Platze  sei. \r\n\r\n\r\n548  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nAber  für  den  innern  bessern  Sinn  sollte  doch  das  Er- \r\nquicklichste bereitet  sein.  Auf  dem  Venezianischen  Platz, \r\nwo  manche  Kutschen,  eh  sie  sich  den  bewegten  Reihen \r\nwieder  anschließen,  die  Vorbeiwallenden  sich  zu  be- \r\nschauen pflegen,  sah  ich  den  Wagen  der  Mad.  Angelica \r\nund  trat  an  den  Schlag,  sie  zu  begrüßen.  Sie  hatte  sich \r\nkaum  freundlich  zu  mir  herausgeneigt,  als  sie  sich  zurück- \r\nbog, um  die  neben  ihr  sitzende,  wieder  genesene  Mai- \r\nländerin mir  sehen  zu  lassen.  Ich  fand  sie  nicht  verän- \r\ndert: denn  wie  sollte  sich  eine  gesunde  Jugend  nicht \r\nschnell  wieder  herstellen;  ja  ihre  Augen  schienen  frischer \r\nund  glänzender  mich  anzusehen,  mit  einer  Freudigkeit, \r\ndie  mich  bis  ins  Innerste  durchdrang.  So  blieben  wir \r\neine  Zeitlang  ohne  Sprache,  als  Mad.  Angelica  das  Wort \r\nnahm  und,  indessen  jene  sich  vorbog,  zu  mir  sagte:  Ich \r\nmuß  nur  den  Dolmetscher  machen;  denn  ich  sehe,  meine \r\njunge  Freundin  kommt  nicht  dazu,  auszusprechen,  was \r\nsie  so  lange  gewünscht,  sich  vorgesetzt  und  mir  öfters \r\nwiederholt  hat,  wie  sehr  sie  Ihnen  verpflichtet  ist  für  den \r\nAnteil,  den  Sie  an  ihrer  Krankheit,  ihrem  Schicksal  ge- \r\nnommen. Das  erste,  was  ihr  beim  Wiedereintritt  in  das \r\nLeben  tröstlich  geworden,  heilsam  und  wiederherstellend \r\nauf  sie  gewirkt,  sei  die  Teilnahme  ihrer  Freunde  und  be- \r\nsonders die  Ihrige  gewesen,  sie  habe  sich  auf  einmal \r\naus  der  tiefsten  Einsamkeit  unter  so  vielen  guten  Men- \r\nschen, wieder  in  dem  schönsten  Kreise  gefunden. \r\nDas  ist  alles  wahr,  sagte  jene,  indem  sie  über  die  Freun- \r\ndin her  mir  die  Hand  reichte,  die  ich  wohl  mit  der  mei- \r\nnigen, aber  nicht  mit  meinen  Lippen  berühren  konnte. \r\nMit  stiller  Zufriedenheit  entfernt  ich  mich  wieder  in  das \r\nGedräng  der  Toren,  mit  dem  zartesten  Gefühl  von \r\nDankbarkeit  gegen  Angelica,  die  sich  des  guten  Mäd- \r\nchens gleich  nach  dem  Unfälle  tröstend  anzunehmen  ge- \r\nwußt und,  was  in  Rom  selten  ist,  ein  bisher  fremdes \r\nFrauenzimmer  in  ihren  edlen  Kreis  aufgenommen  hatte, \r\nwelches  mich  um  so  mehr  rührte,  als  ich  mir  schmeicheln \r\ndurfte,  mein  Anteil  an  dem  guten  Kinde  habe  hierauf \r\nnicht  wenig  eingewirkt. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  17  88  549 \r\n\r\nDer  Senator  von  Rom,  Fürst  Rezzonico,  war  schon  frü- \r\nher, aus  Deutschland  zurückkehrend,  mich  zu  besuchen \r\ngekommen.  Er  hatte  eine  innige  Freundschaft  mit  Herrn \r\nund  Frau  von  Diede  errichtet  und  brachte  mir  angele - \r\ngentliche  Grüße  von  diesen  werten  Gönnern  und  Freun- \r\nden; aber  ich  lehnte,  wie  herkömmlich,  ein  näheres  Ver- \r\nhältnis ab,  sollte  aber  doch  endlich  unausweichlich  in \r\ndiesen  Kreis  gezogen  werden. \r\n\r\nJene  genannten  Freunde,  Herr  und  Frau  von  Diede, \r\nmachten  ihrem  werten  Lebensgenossen  einen  Gegenbe- \r\nsuch, und  ich  konnte  mich  um  so  weniger  entbrechen, \r\nmancherlei  Art  von  Einladungen  anzunehmen,  als  die \r\nDame,  wegen  des  Flügelspiels  berühmt,  in  einem  Konzerte \r\nauf  der  kapitolinischen  Wohnung  des  Senators  sich  hören \r\nzu  lassen  willig  war  und  man  unsern  Genossen  Kayser, \r\ndessen  Geschicklichkeit  ruchtbar  geworden,  zu  einer  Teil- \r\nnahme an  jenen  Exhibitionen  schmeichelhaft  eingeladen \r\nhatte.  Die  unvergleichliche  Aussicht  bei  Sonnenuntergang \r\naus  den  Zimmern  des  Senators  nach  dem  Coliseo  zu  mit \r\nallem  dem,  was  sich  von  den  andern  Seiten  anschließt, \r\nverlieh  freilich  unsermKünstlerblick  das  herrlichste  Schau- \r\nspiel, dem  man  sich  aber  nicht  hingeben  durfte,  um  es \r\ngegen  die  Gesellschaft  an  Achtung  und  Artigkeit  nicht \r\nfehlen  zu  lassen.  Frau  von  Diede  spielte  sodann,  sehr \r\ngroße  Vorzüge  entwickelnd,  ein  bedeutendes  Konzert, \r\nund  man  bot  bald  darauf  unserm  Freunde  den  Platz  an, \r\ndessen  er  sich  denn  auch  ganz  würdig  zu  machen  schien, \r\nwenn  man  dem  Lobe  trauen  darf,  das  er  einerntete.  Ab- \r\nwechselnd ging  es  eine  Weile  fort,  auch  wurde  von  einer \r\nDame  eine  Lieblingsarie  vorgetragen,  endlich  aber,  als \r\ndie  Reihe  wieder  an  Kaysern  kam,  legte  er  ein  anmutiges \r\nThema  zum  Grunde  und  variierte  solches  auf  die  mannig- \r\nfaltigste Weise. \r\n\r\nAlles  war  gut  vonstatten  gegangen,  als  der  Senator  mir \r\nim  Gespräch  manches  Freundliche  sagte,  doch  aber  nicht \r\nbergen  konnte  und  mit  jener  weichen  venezianischen  Art \r\nhalb  bedauernd  versicherte:  er  sei  eigentlich  von  solchen \r\nVariationen  kein  Freund,  werde  hingegen  von  den  aus- \r\ndruckvollen Adagios  seiner  Dame  jederzeit  ganz  entzückt. \r\n\r\n\r\n5  5  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  IH \r\n\r\nNun  will  ich  gerade  nicht  behaupten,  daß  mir  jene  sehn- \r\nsüchtigen Töne,  die  man  im  Adagio  und  Largo  hinzu- \r\nziehen pflegt,  jemals  seien  zuwider  gewesen,  doch  aber \r\nliebt  ich  in  der  Musik  immer  mehr  das  Aufregende,  da \r\nunsere  eigenen  Gefühle,  unser  Nachdenken  über  Verlust \r\nund  Mißlingen  uns  nur  allzu  oft  herabzuziehen  und  zu \r\nüberwältigen  drohen. \r\n\r\nUnserm  Senator  dagegen  könnt  ich  keineswegs  verargen, \r\nja  ich  mußte  ihm  aufs  freundlichste  gönnen,  daß  er  sol- \r\nchen Tönen  gern  sein  Ohr  lieh,  die  ihn  vergewisserten, \r\ner  bewirte  in  dem  herrlichsten  Aufenthalte  der  Welt  eine \r\nso  sehr  geliebte  und  hochverehrte  Freundin. \r\nFür  uns  andere,  besonders  deutsche  Zuhörer  blieb  es  ein \r\nunschätzbarer  Genuß,  in  dem  Augenblicke,  wo  wir  eine \r\ntreffliche,  längst  gekannte  verehrte  Dame,  in  den  zarte- \r\nsten Tönen  sich  auf  dem  Flügel  ergehend,  vernahmen, \r\nzugleich  hinab  vom  Fenster  in  die  einzigste  Gegend  von \r\nder  Welt  zu  schauen  und  in  dem  Abendglanz  der  Sonne, \r\nmit  weniger  Wendung  des  Hauptes,  das  große  Bild  zu \r\nüberblicken,  das  sich,  linker  Hand  vom  Bogen  des  Sep- \r\ntimius  Severus,  das  Campo  Vaccino  entlang  bis  zum  Mi- \r\nnerven- und  Friedenstempel  erstreckte,  um  dahinter  das \r\nColiseo  hervorschauen  zu  lassen,  in  dessen  Gefolge  man \r\ndann,  das  Auge  rechts  wendend,  an  dem  Bogen  des  Ti- \r\ntas vorbeigleitend,  in  dem  Labyrinthe  der  palatinischen \r\nTrümmer  und  ihrer  durch  Gartenkultur  und  wilde  Vege- \r\ntation geschmückten  Einöde  sich  zu  verwirren  und  zu \r\nverweilen  hatte. \r\n\r\n(Eine  im  Jahr  1824  von  Fries  und  Thürmer  gezeichnete \r\nund  gestochene  nordwestliche  Übersicht  von  Rom,  ge- \r\nnommen von  dem  Turme  des  Kapitols,  bitten  wir  hier- \r\nnächst  zu  überschauen;  sie  ist  einige  Stockwerke  höher \r\nund  nach  den  neueren  Ausgrabungen  gefaßt,  aber  im \r\nAbendlichte  und  Beschattung,  wie  wir  sie  damals  gesehen, \r\nwobei  denn  freilich  die  glühende  Farbe  mit  ihren  schat- \r\ntig blauen  Gegensätzen  und  allem  dem  Zauber,  der  dar- \r\naus entspringt,  hinzuzudenken  wäre.) \r\nSodann  hatten  wir  in  diesen  Stunden  als  Glück  zu  schät- \r\nzen, das  herrlichste  Bild,  welches  Mengs  vielleicht  je  ge- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  551 \r\n\r\nmalt  hat,  das  Porträt  Clemens  XIII.  Rezzonico,  der  un- \r\nsern  Gönner,  den  Senator,  als  Nepoten  an  diesen  Posten \r\ngesetzt,  mit  Ruhe  zu  beschauen,  von  dessen  Wert  ich \r\nzum  Schluß  eine  Stelle  aus  dem  Tagebuch  unseres  Freun- \r\ndes anführe: \r\n\r\n'  'Unter  den  von  Mengs  gemalten  Bildnissen,  da  wo  seine \r\nKunst  sich  am  tüchtigsten  bewährte,  ist  das  Bildnis  des \r\nPapstes  Rezzonico.  Der  Künstler  hat  in  diesem  Werk \r\ndie  Venezianer  im  Kolorit  und  in  der  Behandlung  nach- \r\ngeahmt und  sich  eines  glücklichen  Erfolgs  zu  erfreuen; \r\nder  Ton  des  Kolorits  ist  wahr  und  warm  und  der  Aus- \r\ndruck des  Gesichtes  belebt  und  geistreich;  der  Vorhang \r\nvon  Goldstoff,  auf  dem  sich  der  Kopf  und  das  übrige  der \r\nFigur  schön  abheben,  gilt  für  ein  gewagtes  Kunststück  in \r\nder  Malerei,  gelang  aber  vortrefflich,  indem  das  Bild  da- \r\ndurch ein  reiches  harmonisches,  unser  Ange  angenehm \r\nrührendes  Ansehn  erhält.\" \r\n\r\nMärz \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  I.  März. \r\nSonntags  gingen  wir  in  die  Sixtinische  Kapelle,  wo  der \r\nPapst  mit  den  Kardinälen  der  Messe  beiwohnte.  Da  die \r\nletzteren  wegen  der  Fastenzeit  nicht  rot,  sondern  violett \r\ngekleidet  waren,  gab  es  ein  neues  Schauspiel.  Einige \r\nTage  vorher  hatte  ich  Gemälde  von  Albert  Dürer  gesehen \r\nund  freute  mich  nun,  so  etwas  im  Leben  anzutreffen.  Das \r\nGanze  zusammen  war  einzig  groß  und  doch  simpel,  und \r\nich  wundere  mich  nicht,  wenn  Fremde,  die  eben  in  der \r\nKarwoche,  wo  alles  zusammentrifft,  hereinkommen,  sich \r\nkaum  fassen  körmen.  Die  Kapelle  selbst  kenne  ich  recht \r\ngut,  ich  habe  vorigen  Sommer  drin  zu  Mittag  gegessen \r\nund  auf  des  Papstes  Thron  Mittagsruhe  gehalten  und  kann \r\ndie  Gemälde  fast  auswendig;  und  doch,  wenn  alles  bei- \r\nsammen ist,  was  ziu:  Funktion  gehört,  so  ist  es  wieder \r\nwas  anders,  und  man  findet  sich  kaum  wieder. \r\nEs  ward  ein  altes  Motett,  von  einem  Spanier  Morales \r\nkomponiert,  gesungen,  und  wir  hatten  den  Vorschmack \r\nvon  dem,  was  nun  kommen  wird.     Kayser  ist  auch  der \r\n\r\n\r\n5  5  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nMeinung,  daß  man  diese  Musik  nur  hier  hören  kann  und \r\nsoUte,  teils  weil  nirgends  Sänger  ohne  Orgel  und  Instru- \r\nment auf  einen  solchen  Gesang  geübt  sein  könnten,  teils \r\nweil  er  zum  antiken  Inventario  der  päpstlichen  Kapelle \r\nund  zu  dem  Ensemble  der  Michel  Angelos,  des  Jüngsten \r\nGerichts,  der  Propheten  und  biblischen  Geschichte  einzig \r\npasse.  Kayser  wird  dereinst  über  alles  dieses  bestimmte \r\nRechnung  ablegen.  Er  ist  ein  großer  Verehrer  der  alten \r\nMusik  und  studiert  sehr  fleißig  alles,  was  dazu  gehört. \r\nSo  haben  wir  eine  merkwürdige  Sammlung  Psalmen  im \r\nHause;  sie  sind  in  italienische  Verse  gebracht  und  von \r\neinem  venezianischen  Nobile,  Benedetto  Marcello,  zu \r\nAnfang  dieses  Jahrhunderts  in  Musik  gesetzt.  Er  hat  bei \r\nvielen  die  Intonation  der  Juden,  teils  der  spanischen,  teils \r\nder  deutschen,  als  Motiv  angenommen,  zu  andern  hat  er \r\nalte  griechische  Melodien  zu  Grunde  gelegt  und  sie  mit \r\ngroßem  Verstand,  Kunstkenntnis  und  Mäßigkeit  ausge- \r\nführt. Sie  sind  teils  als  Solo,  Duett,  Chor  gesetzt  und \r\nunglaublich  original,  ob  man  gleich  sich  erst  einen  Sinn \r\ndazu  machen  muß.  Kayser  schätzt  sie  sehr  und  wird \r\neinige  daraus  abschreiben.  Vielleicht  kann  man  einmal \r\ndas  ganze  Werk  haben,  das  in  Venedig  1724  gedruckt  ist \r\nund  die  ersten  fünfzig  Psalmen  enthält.  Herder  soll  doch \r\naufstellen,  er  sieht  vielleicht  in  einem  Katalogus  dies  in- \r\nteressante Werk. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  den  Mut  gehabt,  meine  drei  letzten  Bände  auf \r\neinmal  zu  überdenken,  und  ich  weiß  nun  genau,  was  ich \r\nmachen  will;  gebe  nun  der  Himmel  Stimmung  und  Glück, \r\nes  zu  machen. \r\n\r\nEs  war  eine  reichhaltige  Woche,  die  mir  in  der  Erinne- \r\nrung wie  ein  Monat  vorkommt. \r\n\r\nZuerst  ward  der  Plan  zu  Eaust  gemacht,  und  ich  hoffe, \r\ndiese  Operation  soll  mir  geglückt  sein.  Natürlich  ist  es \r\nein  ander  Ding,  das  Stück  jetzt  oder  vor  fünfzehn  Jahren \r\nausschreiben;  ich  denke,  es  soll  nichts  dabei  verlieren, \r\nbesonders  da  ich  jetzt  glaube,  den  Faden  wiedergefunden \r\nzu  haben.  Auch  was  den  Ton  des  Ganzen  betrifft,  bin \r\nich  getröstet;  ich  habe  schon  eine  neue  Szene  ausgeführt, \r\nund  wenn  ich  das  Papier  räuchre,  so  dächt  ich,  sollte  sie \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  553 \r\n\r\nmir  niemand  aus  den  alten  herausfinden.  Da  ich  durch \r\ndie  lange  Ruhe  und  Abgeschiedenheit  ganz  auf  das  Ni- \r\nveau meiner  eignen  Existenz  zurückgebracht  bin,  so  ist \r\nes  merkwürdig,  wie  sehr  ich  mir  gleiche  und  wie  wenig \r\nmein  Innres  durch  Jahre  und  Begebenheiten  gelitten  hat. \r\nDas  alte  Manuskript  macht  mir  manchmal  zu  denken, \r\nwenn  ich  es  vor  mir  sehe.  Es  ist  noch  das  erste,  ja  in \r\nden  Hauptszenen  gleich  so  ohne  Konzept  hingeschrieben; \r\nnun  ist  es  so  gelb  von  der  Zeit,  so  vergriöen — die  Lagen \r\nwaren  nie  geheftet — so  mürbe  und  an  den  Rändern  zer- \r\nstoßen, daß  es  wirklich  wie  das  Fragment  eines  alten \r\nKodex  aussieht,  so  daß  ich,  wie  ich  damals  in  eine  frühere \r\nWelt  mich  mit  Sinnen  und  Ahnen  versetzte,  mich  jetzt  in \r\neine  selbstgelebte  Vorzeit  wieder  versetzen  muß. \r\nAuch  ist  der  Plan  von  Tasso  in  Ordnung  und  die  ver- \r\nmischten Gedichte  zum  letzten  Bande  meist  ins  reine  ge- \r\nschrieben. Des  Künstlers  Erdewallen  soll  neu  ausge- \r\nführt und  dessen  Apotheose  hinzugetan  werden.  Zu \r\ndiesen  Jugendeinfällen  habe  ich  nun  erst  die  Studien  ge- \r\nmacht, und  alles  Detail  ist  mir  nun  recht  lebendig.  Ich \r\nfreue  mich  auch  darauf  und  habe  die  beste  Hoffnung  zu \r\nden  drei  letzten  Bänden:  ich  sehe  sie  im  ganzen  schon \r\nvor  mir  stehen  und  wünsche  mir  nur  Muße  und  Gemüts- \r\nruhe, um  nun  Schrittvor  Schritt  das  Gedachte  auszuführen. \r\nZur  Stellung  der  verschiedenen  kleinen  Gedichte  habe \r\nich  mir  deine  Sammlungen  der  \"Zerstreuten  Blätter\"  zum \r\nMuster  dienen  lassen  und  hoffe,  zur  Verbindung  so  dis- \r\nparater Dinge  gute  Mittel  gefunden  zu  haben,  wie  auch \r\neine  Art,  die  allzu  individuellen  und  momentanen  Stücke \r\neinigermaßen  genießbar  zu  machen. \r\nNach  diesen  Betrachtungen  ist  die  neue  Ausgabe  von \r\nMengsens  Schriften  ins  Haus  gekommen,  ein  Buch,  das \r\nmir  jetzt  unendlich  interessant  ist,  weil  ich  die  sinnlichen \r\nBegriffe  besitze,  die  notwendig  vorausgehen  müssen,  um \r\nnur  eine  Zeile  des  Werks  recht  zu  verstehen.  Es  ist  in \r\naUem  Sinne  ein  trefflich  Buch;  man  liest  keine  Seite  ohne \r\nentschiedenen  Nutzen.  Auch  seinen  Fragmenten  über \r\ndie  Schönheit,  welche  manchem  so  dunkel  scheinen,  habe \r\nich  glückliche  Erleuchtungen  zu  danken. \r\n\r\n\r\n554  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nFerner  habe  ich  allerlei  Spekulationen  über  Farben  ge- \r\nmacht, welche  mir  sehr  anliegen,  weil  das  der  Teil  ist, \r\nvon  dem  ich  bisher  am  wenigsten  begriff.  Ich  sehe,  daß \r\nich  mit  einiger  Übung  und  anhaltendem  Nachdenken  auch \r\ndiesen  schönen  Genuß  der  Weltoberfläche  mir  werde  zu- \r\neignen können. \r\n\r\nIch  war  einen  Morgen  in  der  Galerie  Borghese,  welche \r\nich  in  einem  Jahr  nicht  gesehen  hatte,  und  fand  zu  mei- \r\nner Freude,  daß  ich  sie  mit  viel  verständigern  Augen \r\nsah.  Es  sind  unsägliche  Kunstschätze  in  dem  Besitz  des \r\nFürsten. \r\n\r\nDe7i  y.  März. \r\nEine  gute,  reiche  und  stille  Woche  ist  wieder  vorbei. \r\nSonntags  versäumten  v/ir  die  päpstliche  Kapelle,  dagegen \r\nsah  ich  mit  Angelica  ein  sehr  schönes  Gemälde,  das  billig \r\nfür  Correggio  gehalten  wird. \r\n\r\nIch  sah  die  Sammlung  der  Akademie  San  Luca,  wo \r\nRafiaels  Schädel  ist.  Diese  Reliquie  scheint  mir  unge- \r\nzweifelt.  Ein  trefflicher  Knochenbau,  in  welchem  eine \r\nschöne  Seele  bequem  spazieren  konnte.  Der  Herzog  ver- \r\nlangt einen  Abguß  davon,  den  ich  wahrscheinlich  werde \r\nverschafien  können.  Das  Bild,  das  von  ihm  gemalt  ist  und \r\nin  gleichem  Saale  hängt,  ist  seiner  wert. \r\nAuch  habe  ich  das  Kapitol  wieder  gesehen  und  einige \r\nandere  Sachen,  die  mir  zurückblieben,  vorzüglich  Cava- \r\nceppis  Haus,  das  ich  immer  versäumt  hatte  zu  sehen. \r\nUnter  vielen  köstlichen  Sachen  haben  mich  vorzüglich \r\nergötzt  zwei  Abgüsse  der  Köpfe  von  den  Kolossalstatuen \r\nauf  dem  Monte  Cavallo.  Man  kann  sie  bei  Cavaceppi  in \r\nder  Nähe,  in  ihrer  ganzen  Größe  und  Schönheit  sehn. \r\nLeider,  daß  der  beste  durch  Zeit  und  Witterung  fast  einen \r\nStrohhalm  dick  der  glatten  Oberfläche  des  Gesichts  ver- \r\nloren hat  und  in  der  Nähe  wie  von  Pocken  übel  zuge- \r\nrichtet aussieht. \r\n\r\nHeute  waren  die  Exequien  des  Kardinal  Visconti  in  der \r\nKirche  San  Carlo.  Da  die  päpstliche  Kapelle  zum  Hoch- \r\namt sang,  gingen  wir  hin,  die  Ohren  auf  morgen  recht \r\nauszuwaschen.     Es  ward  ein  Requiem  gesungen  zu  zwei \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  555 \r\n\r\nSopranen,  das  Seltsamste,  was  man  hören  kann.  NB.  Auch \r\ndabei  war  weder  Orgel  noch  andere  Musik. \r\nWelch  ein  leidig  Instrument  die  Orgel  sei,  ist  mir  gestern \r\nabend  in  dem  Chor  von  St.  Peter  recht  aufgefallen:  man \r\nbegleitete  damit  den  Gesang  bei  der  Vesper,  es  verbindet \r\nsich  so  gar  nicht  mit  der  Menschenstimme  und  ist  so  ge- \r\nwaltig. Wie  reizend  dagegen  in  der  Sixtinischen  Kapelle, \r\nwo  die  Stimmen  allein  sind. \r\n\r\nDas  Wetter  ist  seit  einigen  Tagen  trübe  und  gelind.  Der \r\nMandelbaum  hat  größtenteils  verblüht  und  grünt  jetzt; \r\nnur  wenige  Blüten  sind  auf  den  Gipfeln  noch  zu  sehen. \r\nNun  folgt  der  Pfirsichbaum,  der  mit  seiner  schönen  Farbe \r\ndie  Gärten  ziert.  Viburnum  Tinus  blüht  auf  allen  Ruinen, \r\ndie  Attichbüsche  in  den  Hecken  sind  alle  ausgeschlagen \r\nund  andere,  die  ich  nicht  kenne.  Die  Mauern  und  Dä- \r\ncher werden  nun  grüner,  auf  einigen  zeigen  sich  Blumen. \r\nIn  meinem  neuen  Kabinett,  wohin  ich  zog,  weil  wir  Tisch- \r\nbein von  Neapel  erwarten,  habe  ich  eine  mannigfaltige \r\nAussicht  in  unzählige  Gärtchen  und  auf  die  hinteren  Ga- \r\nlerien vieler  Häuser.  Es  ist  gar  zu  lustig. \r\nIch  habe  angefangen,  ein  wenig  zu  modellieren.  Was  den \r\nErkenntnispunkt  betrifft,  gehe  ich  sehr  rein  und  sicher \r\nfort;  in  Anwendung  der  tätigen  Kraft  bin  ich  ein  wenig \r\nkonfus.    So  geht  es  mir  wie  allen  meinen  Brüdern. \r\n\r\nDen  14.  März. \r\nDie  nächste  Woche  ist  hier  nichts  zu  denken  noch  zu  tun, \r\nman  muß  dem  Schwall  der  Feierlichkeiten  folgen.  Nach \r\nOstern  werde  ich  noch  einiges  sehen,  was  mir  zurück- \r\nblieb, meinen  Faden  ablösen,  meine  Rechnung  machen, \r\nmeinen  Bündel  packen  und  mit  Kaysern  davonziehn. \r\nWenn  alles  geht,  wie  ich  wünsche  und  vorhabe,  bin  ich \r\nEnde  Aprils  in  Florenz.  Inzwischen  hört  ihr  noch  von \r\nmir. \r\n\r\nSonderbar  war  es,  daß  ich  auf  äußere  Veranlassung  ver- \r\nschiedene Maßregeln  nehmen  mußte,  welche  mich  in  neue \r\nVerhältnisse  setzten,  wodurch  mein  Aufenthalt  in  Rom \r\nimmer  schöner,  nützlicher  und  glücklicher  ward.  Ja  ich \r\nkann  sagen,   daß  ich   die  höchste  Zufriedenheit  meines \r\n\r\n\r\n556  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nLebens  in  diesen  letzten  acht  Wochen  genossen  habe  und \r\nnun  wenigstens  einen  äußersten  Punkt  kenne,  nach  wel- \r\nchem ich  das  Thermometer  meiner  Existenz  künftig  ab- \r\nmessen kann. \r\n\r\nDiese  Woche  hat  sich,  ungeachtet  des  üblen  Wetters,  gut \r\ngehalten.  Sonntags  hörten  wir  in  der  Sixtinischen  Ka- \r\npelle ein  Motett  von  Palestrina.  Dienstag  wollte  uns  das \r\nGlück,  daß  man  zu  Ehren  einer  Eremden  verschiedene \r\nTeile  der  Karwochsmusik  in  einem  Saale  sang.  Wir  hör- \r\nten sie  also  mit  größter  Bequemlichkeit  und  konnten  uns, \r\nda  wir  sie  so  oft  am  Klavier  durchsangen,  einen  vorläu- \r\nfigen Begriff  davon  machen.  Es  ist  ein  unglaublich  gro- \r\nßes simples  Kunstwerk,  dessen  immer  erneuerte  Darstel- \r\nlung sich  wohl  nirgends  als  an  diesem  Orte  und  unter \r\ndiesen  Umständen  erhalten  konnte.  Bei  näherer  Be- \r\ntrachtung fallen  freilich  mancherlei  Handwerksburschen- \r\nTraditionen,  welche  die  Sache  wunderbar  und  unerhört \r\nmachen,  weg;  mit  allem  dem  bleibt  es  etwas  Außer- \r\nordentliches und  ist  ein  ganz  neuer  Begriff.  Kayser  wird \r\ndereinst  Rechenschaft  davon  ablegen  können.  Er  wird \r\ndie  Vergünstigung  erhalten,  eine  Probe  in  der  Kapelle \r\nanzuhören,  wozu  sonst  niemand  gelassen  wird. \r\nFerner  habe  ich  diese  Woche  einen  Fuß  modelliert,  nach \r\nvorgängigem  Studio  der  Knochen  und  Muskeln,  und \r\nwerde  von  meinem  Meister  gelobt.  Wer  den  ganzen \r\nKörper  so  durchgearbeitet  hätte,  wäre  um  ein  gutes  Teil \r\nklüger;  versteht  sich  in  Rom,  mit  allen  Hülfsmitteln  und \r\ndem  mannigfaltigen  Rat  der  Verständigen.  Ich  habe  ei- \r\nnen Skelettfuß,  eine  schöne  auf  die  Natur  gegossene  Ana- \r\ntomie, ein  halb  Dutzend  der  schönsten  antiken  Füße,  ei- \r\nnige schlechte,  jene  zur  Nachahmung,  diese  zur  Warnung, \r\nund  die  Natur  kann  ich  auch  zu  Rate  ziehen:  in  jeder \r\nVilla,  in  die  ich  trete,  finde  ich  Gelegenheit,  nach  diesen \r\nTeilen  zu  sehen;  Gemälde  zeigen  mir,  was  Maler  gedacht \r\nund  gemacht  haben.  Drei,  vier  Künstler  kommen  täglich \r\nauf  mein  Zimmer,  deren  Rat  und  Anmerkung  ich  nutze, \r\nunter  welchen  jedoch,  genau  besehen,  Heinrich  Meyers \r\nRat  und  Nachhülfe  mich  am  meisten  fördert.  Wenn  mit \r\ndiesem  Winde,  auf  diesem  Elemente  ein  Schiff  nicht  von \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  557 \r\n\r\nder  Stelle  käme,  so  müßte  es  keine  Segel  oder  einen \r\nwahnsinnigen  Steuermann  haben.  Bei  der  allgemeinen \r\nÜbersicht  der  Kunst,  die  ich  mir  gemacht  habe,  war  es \r\nmir  sehr  notwendig,  nun  mit  Aufmerksamkeit  und  Fleiß \r\nan  einzelne  Teile  zu  gehn.  Es  ist  angenehm,  auch  im \r\nUnendlichen  vorwärts  zu  kommen. \r\n\r\nIch  fahre  fort,  überall  herum  zu  gehn  und  vernachlässigte \r\nGegenstände  zu  betrachten.  So  war  ich  gestern  zum \r\nerstenmal  in  Rafifaels  Villa,  wo  er  an  der  Seite  seiner \r\nGeliebten  den  Genuß  des  Lebens  aller  Kunst  und  allem \r\nRuhm  vorzog.  Es  ist  ein  heilig  Monument.  Der  Fürst \r\nDoria  hat  sie  akquiriert  und  scheint  sie  behandeln  zu \r\nwollen,  wie  sie  es  verdient.  Rafifael  hat  seine  Geliebte \r\nachtundzwanzigmal  auf  die  Wand  porträtiert  in  allerlei \r\nArten  von  Kleidern  und  Kostüme;  selbst  in  den  histori- \r\nschen Kompositionen  gleichen  ihr  die  Weiber.  Die  Lage \r\ndes  Hauses  ist  sehr  schön.  Es  wird  sich  artiger  davon \r\nerzählen  lassen,  als  sichs  schreibt.  Man  muß  das  ganze \r\nDetail  bemerken. \r\n\r\nDann  ging  ich  in  die  Villa  Albani  und  sah  mich  nur  im \r\nallgemeinen  darin  um.  Es  war  ein  herrlicher  Tag.  Heute \r\nnacht  hat  es  sehr  geregnet,  jetzt  scheint  die  Sonne  wie- \r\nder, und  vor  meinem  Fenster  ist  ein  Paradies.  Der  Man- \r\ndelbaum ist  ganz  grün,  die  Pfirsichblüten  fangen  schon \r\nan,  abzufallen,  und  die  Zitronenblüten  brechen  auf  dem \r\nGipfel  des  Baumes  auf. \r\n\r\nMein  Abschied  von  hier  betrübt  drei  Personen  innigst. \r\nSie  werden  nie  wieder  finden,  was  sie  an  mir  gehabt  ha- \r\nben; ich  verlasse  sie  mit  Schmerzen.  In  Rom  hab  ich \r\nmich  selbst  zuerst  gefunden,  ich  bin  zuerst  übereinstim- \r\nmend mit  mir  selbst  glücklich  und  vernünftig  geworden,  und \r\nals  einen  solchen  haben  mich  diese  Dreie  in  verschiedenem \r\nSinne  und  Grade  gekannt,  besessen  und  genossen. \r\n\r\nDen  22.  März. \r\nHeute  geh  ich  nicht  nach  St.  Peter  und  will  ein  Blättchen \r\nschreiben.  Nun  ist  auch  die  heilige  Woche  mit  ihren  Wun- \r\ndern und  Beschwerden  vorüber;  morgen  nehmen  wir  noch \r\n\r\n\r\n5  5  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\neine  Benediktion  auf  uns,  und  dann  wendet  sich  das  Ge- \r\nmüt ganz  zu  einem  andern  Leben. \r\n\r\nIch  habe  durch  Gunst  und  Mühe  guter  Freunde  alles  ge- \r\nsehen und  gehört,  besonders  ist  die  Fußwaschung  und  die \r\nSpeisung  der  Pilger  nur  durch  großes  Drängen  und  Drücken \r\nzu  erkaufen. \r\n\r\nDie  Kapellmusik  ist  undenkbar  schön.  Besonders  das  Mi- \r\nserere von  Allegri  und  die  sogenannten  Improperien,  die \r\nVorwürfe,  welche  der  gekreuzigte  Gott  seinemVolke  macht. \r\nSie  werden  Karfreitags  frühe  gesungen.  Der  Augenblick, \r\nwenn  der  aller  seiner  Pracht  entkleidete  Papst  vom  Thron \r\nsteigt,  um  das  Kreuz  anzubeten,  und  alles  übrige  an  seiner \r\nStelle  bleibt,  jedermann  still  ist  und  das  Chor  anfangt: \r\nPopulus  meus,  quid  feci  tibi?  ist  eine  der  schönsten  unter \r\nallen  merkwürdigen  Funktionen.  Das  soll  nun  alles  münd- \r\nlich ausgeführt  werden,  und  was  von  Musik  transportabel \r\nist,  bringt  Kayser  mit.  Ich  habe  nach  meinem  Wunsch \r\nalles,  was  an  den  Funktionen  genießbar  war,  genossen \r\nund  über  das  übrige  meine  stillen  Betrachtungen  ange- \r\nstellt. Effekt,  wie  man  zu  sagen  pflegt,  hat  nichts  auf  mich \r\ngemacht,  nichts  hat  mir  eigentlich  imponiert,  aber  be- \r\nwundert hab  ich  alles;  denn  das  muß  man  ihnen  nach- \r\nsagen, daß  sie  die  christlichen  Überlieferungen  vollkom- \r\nmen durchgearbeitet  haben.  Bei  den  päpstlichen  Funk- \r\ntionen, besonders  in  der  Sixtinischen  Kapelle,  geschieht \r\nalles,  was  am  katholischen  Gottesdienste  sonst  unerfreu- \r\nlich erscheint,  mit  großem  Geschmack  und  voUkommner \r\nWürde.  Es  kann  aber  auch  nur  da  geschehen,  wo  seit \r\nJahrhunderten  alle  Künste  zu  Gebote  standen. \r\nDas  einzelne  davon  würde  jetzt  nicht  zu  erzählen  sein. \r\nHätte  ich  nicht  in  der  Zwischenzeit  auf  jene  Veranlassung \r\nwieder  stille  gehalten  und  an  ein  längeres  Bleiben  geglaubt, \r\nso  könnt  ich  nächste  Woche  fort.  Doch  auch  das  gereicht \r\nmir  zum  Besten.  Ich  habe  diese  Zeit  wieder  viel  studiert, \r\nund  die  Epoche,  auf  die  ich  hofile,  hat  sich  geschlossen \r\nund  gerundet.  Es  ist  zwar  immer  eine  sonderbare  Emp- \r\nfindung, eine  Bahn,  auf  der  man  mit  starken  Schritten \r\nfortgeht,  auf  einmal  zu  verlassen,  doch  muß  man  sich \r\ndarein  finden  und  nicht  viel  Wesens  machen.    In  jeder \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  559 \r\n\r\ngroßen  Trennung  liegt  ein  Keim  von  Wahnsinn;  man \r\nmuß  sich  hüten,  ihn  nachdenklich  auszubrüten  und  zu \r\npflegen. \r\n\r\nSchöne  Zeichnungen  habe  ich  von  Neapel  erhalten,  von \r\nKniep,  dem  Maler,  der  mich  nach  Sizilien  begleitet  hat. \r\nEs  sind  schöne  liebliche  Früchte  meiner  Reise  und  für \r\neuch  die  angenehmsten;  denn  was  man  einem  vor  die \r\nAugen  bringen  kann,  gibt  man  ihm  am  sichersten.  Ei- \r\nnige drunter  sind,  dem  Ton  der  Farbe  nach,  ganz  köst- \r\nlich geraten,  und  ihr  werdet  kaum  glauben,  daß  jene  Welt \r\nso  schön  ist. \r\n\r\nSo  viel  kann  ich  sagen,  daß  ich  in  Rom  immer  glücklicher \r\ngeworden  bin,  daß  noch  mit  jedem  Tage  mein  Vergnügen \r\nwächst;  und  wenn  es  traurig  scheinen  möchte,  daß  ich \r\neben  scheiden  soll,  da  ich  am  meisten  verdiente  zu  bleiben, \r\nso  ist  es  doch  wieder  eine  große  Beruhigung,  daß  ich \r\nso  lang  habe  bleiben  können,  um  auf  dcfi  Punkt  zu  ge- \r\nlangen. \r\n\r\nSoeben  steht  der  Herr  Christus  mit  entsetzlichem  Lärm \r\nauf.  Das  Kastell  feuert  ab,  alle  Glocken  läuten,  und  an \r\nallen  Ecken  und  Enden  hört  man  Petarden,  Schwärmet\" \r\nund  Lauffeuer.    Um  elf  Uhr  morgens. \r\n\r\nBericht \r\nMärz \r\nEs  ist  uns  erinnerlich,  wie  Philippus  Neri  den  Besuch  der \r\nsieben  Hauptkirchen  Roms  sich  öfters  zur  Pflicht  gemacht \r\nund  dadurch  von  der  Inbrunst  seiner  Andacht  einen  deut- \r\nliehen  Beweis  gegeben.  Hier  nun  aber  ist  zu  bemerken, \r\ndaß  eine  Wallfahrt  zu  gedachten  Kirchen  von  jedem  Pil- \r\nger, der  zum  Jubiläum  herankommt,  notwendig  gefordert \r\nwird  und  wirklich  wegen  der  weit  entfernten  Lage  dieser \r\nStationen,  insofern  der  Weg  an  eine7ti  Tage  zurückgelegt \r\nwerden  soll,  einer  abermaligen  anstrengenden  Reise  wohl \r\ngleich  zu  achten  ist. \r\n\r\nJene  sieben  Kirchen  aber  sind:  St.  Peter,  Santa  Maria \r\nMaggiore,  San  Lorenzo  außer  den  Mauern,  San  Sebastian, \r\nSt.  Johann  im  Lateran,  Santa  Croce  in  Jerusalem,  St.  Paul \r\nvor  den  Mauern. \r\n\r\n\r\n56o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nEinen  solchen  Umgang  nun  vollführen  auch  einheimische \r\nfromme  Seelen  in  der  Karwoche,  besonders  am  Karfreitag. \r\nDa  man  aber  zu  dem  geistlichen  Vorteil,  welchen  die  See- \r\nlen durch  den  damit  verknüpften  Ablaß  erwerben  und  ge- \r\nnießen, noch  einen  leiblichen  Genuß  hinzugetan,  so  wird \r\nin  solcher  Hinsicht  Ziel  und  Zweck  noch  reizender. \r\nWer  nämlich  nach  vollbrachter  Wallfahrt  mit  gehörigen \r\nZeugnissen  zum  Tore  von  St.  Paul  endlich  wieder  her- \r\neintritt, erhält  daselbst  ein  Billett,  um  an  einem  frommen \r\nVolksfeste  in  der  Villa  Mattei  an  bestimmten  Tagen  teil- \r\nnehmen zu  können.  Dort  erhalten  die  Eingelassenen  eine \r\nKollation  von  Brot,  Wein,  etwas  Käse  oder  Eiern;  die \r\nGenießenden  sind  dabei  im  Garten  umher  gelagert,  vor- \r\nnehmlich in  dem  kleinen  daselbst  befindlichen  Amphi- \r\ntheater. Gegenüber,  in  dem  Kasino  der  Villa,  findet  sich \r\ndie  höhere  Gesellschaft  zusammen,  Kardinäle,  Prälaten, \r\nFürsten  und  Herreu,  um  sich  an  dem  Anblick  zu  ergötzen \r\nund  somit  auch  ihren  Teil  an  der  Spende,  von  der  Fa- \r\nmilie Mattei  gestiftet,  hinzunehmen. \r\n\r\nWir  sahen  eine  Prozession  von  etwa  zehn-  bis  zwölfjäh- \r\nrigen Knaben  herankommen,  nicht  im  geistlichen  Gewand, \r\nsondern  wie  es  etwa  Handwerkslehrlingen  am  Festtage \r\nzu  erscheinen  geziemen  möchte,  in  Kleidern  gleicher  Farbe, \r\ngleichen  Schnitts,  paarweise;  es  konnten  ihrer  vierzig  sein. \r\nSie  sangen  und  sprachen  ihre  Litaneien  fromm  vor  sich \r\nhin  und  wandelten  still  und  züchtig. \r\nEin  alter  Mann  von  kräftigem,  handwerksmäßigem  Ansehn \r\nging  an  ihnen  her  und  schien  das  Ganze  zu  ordnen  und  zu \r\nleiten.  Auffallend  war  es,  die  vorüberziehende  wohlge- \r\nkleidete Reihe  durch  ein  halb  Dutzend  bettelhafte,  barfuß \r\nund  zerlumpt  einhergehende  Kinder  geschlossen  zu  sehen, \r\nwelche  jedoch  in  gleicher  Zucht  und  Sitte  dahin  wandel- \r\nten. Erkundigung  deshalb  gab  uns  zu  vernehmen:  dieser \r\nMann,  ein  Schuster  von  Profession  und  kinderlos,  habe \r\nsich  früher  bewogen  gefühlt,  einen  armen  Knaben  auf- \r\nund  in  die  Lehre  zu  nehmen,  mit  Beistand  von  Wohl- \r\nwollenden ihn  zu  kleiden  und  weiterzubringen.  Durch  ein \r\nsolches  gegebenes  Beispiel  söi  es  ihm  gelungen,  andere \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  561 \r\n\r\nMeister  zu  gleicher  Aufnahme  von  Kindern  zu  bewegen, \r\ndie  er  ebenfalls  zu  befördern  alsdann  besorgt  gewesen. \r\nAuf  diese  Weise  habe  sich  ein  kleines  Häuflein  gesammelt, \r\nwelches  er  zu  gottesfürchtigen Handlungen,  um  den  schäd- \r\nlichen Müßiggang  an  Sonn-  und  Feiertagen  zu  verhüten, \r\nununterbrochen  angehalten,  ja  sogar  den  Besuch  der  weit \r\nauseinander  liegenden  Hauptkirchen  an  einem  Tage  von \r\nihnen  gefordert.  Auf  diese  Weise  nun  sei  diese  fromme \r\nAnstalt  immer  gewachsen;  er  verrichte  seine  verdienst- \r\nlichen Wanderungen  nach  wie  vor,  und  weil  sich  zu  einer \r\nso  augenfällig  nutzbaren  Anstalt  immer  mehr  hinzudrängen, \r\nals  aufgenommen  werden  könnten,  so  bediene  er  sich  des \r\nMittels,  um  die  allgemeine  Wohltätigkeit  zu  erregen,  daß \r\ner  die  noch  zu  versorgenden,  zu  bekleidenden  Kinder \r\nseinem  Zuge  anschließe,  da  es  ihm  denn  jedesmal  ge- \r\nlinge, zu  Versorgung  eines  und  des  andern  hinreichende \r\nSpende  zu  erhalten. \r\n\r\nWährend  wir  uns  hievon  unterrichteten,  war  einer  der \r\nälteren  und  bekleideten  Knaben  auch  in  unsere  Nähe  ge- \r\nkommen, bot  uns  einen  Teller  und  verlangte  mit  gut  ge- \r\nsetzten Worten  für  die  nackten  und  sohlenlosen  beschei- \r\nden eine  Gabe.  Er  empfing  sie  nicht  nur  von  uns  ge- \r\nrührten Fremden  reichlich,  sondern  auch  von  den  an- \r\nstehenden, sonst  pfennigkargen  Römern  und  Römerinnen, \r\ndie  einer  mäßigen  Spende  mit  viel  Worten  segnender  An- \r\nerkennung jenes  Verdienstes  noch  ein  frommes  Gewicht \r\nbeizufügen  nicht  unterließen. \r\n\r\nMan  wollte  wissen,  daß  der  fromme  Kindervater  jedes- \r\nmal seinePupillen  an  jener  Spende  teilnehmen  lasse,  nach- \r\ndem sie  sich  durch  vorhergegangene  Wanderung  erbaut; \r\nwobei  es  denn  niemals  an  leidlicher  Einnahme  zu  seinem \r\nedlen  Zwecke  fehlen  kann. \r\n\r\nÜber  die  bildende  Nachahmung  des  Schönen \r\n\r\nvon  Karl  Philipp  Moritz.     Braunschweig  1788. \r\n\r\nUnter  diesem  Titel  ward  ein  Heft  von  kaum  vier  Bogen \r\ngedruckt,  wozu  Moritz  das  Manuskript  nach  Deutschland \r\ngeschickt  hatte,  um  seinen  Verleger  über  den  Vorschuß \r\neiner  Reisebeschreibung  nach  Italien  einigermaßen  zu  be- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  36 \r\n\r\n\r\n502  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nschwichtigen.  Freilich  war  eine  solche  nicht  so  leicht  als \r\ndie  einer  abenteuerlichen  Fußwanderung  durch  England \r\nniederzuschreiben. \r\n\r\nGedachtes  Heft  aber  darf  ich  nicht  unerwähnt  lassen;  es \r\nwar  aus  unsern  Unterhaltungen  hervorgegangen,  welche \r\nMoritz  nach  seiner  Art  benutzt  und  ausgebildet.  Wie  es \r\nnun  damit  auch  sei,  so  kann  es  geschichtlich  einiges  In- \r\nteresse haben,  um  daraus  zu  ersehen,  was  für  Gedanken \r\nsich  in  jener  Zeit  vor  uns  auftaten,  welche,  späterhin \r\nentwickelt,  geprüft,  angewendet  und  verbreitet,  mit  der \r\nDenkweise  des  Jahrhunderts  glücklich  genug  zusammen- \r\ntrafen. \r\n\r\nEinige  Blätter  «,us  der  Mitte  des  Vortrags  mögen  hier  ein- \r\ngeschaltet stehen;  vielleicht  nimmt  man  hievon  Veran- \r\nlassung, das  Ganze  wieder  abzudrucken. \r\n\"Der  Horizont  der  tätigen  Kraft  aber  muß  bei  dem  bil- \r\ndenden Genie  so  weit  wie  die  Natur  selber  sein,  das  heißt, \r\ndie  Organisation  muß  so  fein  gewebt  sein  und  so  unend- \r\nlich viele  Berührungspunkte  der  allumströmenden  Natur \r\ndarbieten,  daß  gleichsam  die  äußersten  Enden  von  allen \r\nVerhältnissen  der  Natur  im  großen,  hier  im  kleinen  sich \r\nnebeneinander  stellend,  Raum  genug  haben,  um  sich  ein- \r\nander nicht  verdrängen  zu  dürfen. \r\n\r\nWenn  nun  eine  Organisation  von  diesem  feinern  Gewebe \r\nbei  ihrer  völligen  Entwicklung  auf  einmal  in  der  dunklen \r\nAhnung  ihrer  tätigen  Kraft  ein  Ganzes  faßt,  das  weder  in \r\nihr  Auge  noch  in  ihr  Ohr,  weder  in  ihre  Einbildungskraft \r\nnoch  in  ihre  Gedanken  kam,  so  muß  notwendig  eine  Un- \r\nruhe, ein  Mißverhältnis  zwischen  den  sich  wägenden  Kräf- \r\nten so  lange  entstehen,  bis  sie  wieder  in  ihr  Gleichgewicht \r\nkommen. \r\n\r\nBei  einer  Seele,  deren  bloß  tätige  Kraft  schon  das  edle, \r\ngroße  Ganze  der  Natur  in  dunkler  Ahnung  faßt,  kann  die \r\ndeutlich  erkennende  Denkkraft,  die  noch  lebhafter  dar- \r\nstellende Einbildungskraft  und  der  am  hellsten  spiegelnde \r\näußre  Sinn  mit  der  Betrachtung  des  einzelnen  im  Zu- \r\nsammenhange der  Natur  sich  nicht  mehr  begnügen. \r\nAlle  die  in  der  tätigen  Kraft  bloß  dunkel  geahneten  Ver- \r\nhältnisse jenes  großen  Ganzen  müssen  notwendig  auf  ir- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  563 \r\n\r\ngend  eine  Weise  entweder  sichtbar,  hörbar,  oder  doch \r\nder  Einbildungskraft  faßbar  werden;  und  um  dies  zu  wer- \r\nden, muß  die  Tatkraft,  worin  sie  schlummern,  sie  nach \r\nsich  selber,  aus  sich  selber  bilden. — Sie  muß  alle  jene \r\nVerhältnisse  des  großen  Ganzen  und  in  ihnen  das  höchste \r\nSchöne,  wie  an  den  Spitzen  seiner  Strahlen,  in  einen \r\nBrennpunkt  fassen. — Aus  diesem  Brennpunkte  muß  sich, \r\nnach  des  Auges  gemessener  Weite,  ein  zartes  und  doch \r\ngetreues  Bild  des  höchsten  Schönen  runden,  das  die  voll- \r\nkommensten Verhältnisse  des  großen  Ganzen  der  Natur, \r\nebenso  wahr  und  richtig  wie  sie  selbst,  in  seinen  kleinen \r\nUmfang  faßt. \r\n\r\nWeil  nun  aber  dieser  Abdruck  des  höchsten  Schönen  not- \r\nwendig an  etwas  haften  muß,  so  wählt  die  bildende  Kraft, \r\ndurch  ihre  Individualität  bestimmt,  irgend  einen  sicht- \r\nbaren, hörbaren  oder  doch  der  Einbildungskraft  faßbaren \r\nGegenstand,  auf  den  sie  den  Abglanz  des  höchsten  Schö- \r\nnen im  verjüngenden  Maßstabe  überträgt.  — Und  weil \r\ndieser  Gegenstand  wiederum,  wenn  er  wirklich,  was  er \r\ndarstellt,  wäre,  mit  dem  Zusammenhange  der  Natur,  die \r\naußer  sich  selber  kein  wirklich  eigenmächtiges  Ganze \r\nduldet,  nicht  ferner  bestehen  könnte,  so  führet  uns  dies \r\nauf  den  Punkt,  wo  wir  schon  einmal  waren:  daß  jedesmal \r\ndas  innere  Wesen  erst  in  die  Erscheinung  sich  verwandeln \r\nmüsse,  ehe  es,  durch  die  Kunst,  zu  einem  für  sich  be- \r\nstehenden Ganzen  gebildet  werden  und  ungehindert  die \r\nVerhältnisse  des  großen  Ganzen  der  Natur  in  ihrem  völ- \r\nligen Umfange  spiegeln  kann. \r\n\r\nDa  nun  aber  jene  großen  Verhältnisse,  in  deren  völligem \r\nUmfange  eben  das  Schöne  liegt,  nicht  mehr  unter  das \r\nGebiet  der  Denkkraft  fallen,  so  kann  auch  der  lebendige \r\nBegriff  von  der  bildenden  Nachahmung  des  Schönen  nur \r\nim  Gefühl  der  tätigen  Kraft,  die  es  hervorbringt,  im  ersten \r\nAugenblick  der  Entstehung  stattfinden,  wo  das  Werk,  als \r\nschon  vollendet,  durch  alle  Grade  seines  allmählichen \r\nWerdens,  in  dunkler  Ahnung,  auf  einmal  vor  die  Seele \r\ntritt  und  in  diesem  Moment  der  ersten  Erzeugung  gleich- \r\nsam vor  seinem  wirklichen  Dasein  da  ist;  wodurch \r\nalsdann    auch    jener    unnennbare    Reiz    entsteht,    wel- \r\n\r\n\r\n5  6  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  lU \r\n\r\neher  das  schaßende  Genie  zur  immerwährenden  Bildung \r\ntreibt. \r\n\r\nDurch  unser  Nachdenken  über  die  bildende  Nachahmung \r\ndes  Schönen,  mit  dem  reinen  Genuß  der  schönen  Kunst- \r\nwerke selbst  vereint,  kann  zwar  etwas  jenem  lebendigen \r\nBegriff  ncäher  Kommendes  in  uns  entstehen,  das  den  Ge- \r\nnuß der  schonen  Kunstwerke  in  uns  erhöht.  Allein  da \r\nunser  höchster  Genuß  des  Schönen  dennoch  sein  Werden \r\naus  unsrer  eigimi  Kraft  unmöglich  mit  in  sich  fassen  kann, \r\nso  bleibt  der  einzige  höchste  Genuß  desselben  immer \r\ndem  schaffenden  Genie,  das  es  hervorbringt,  selber,  und \r\ndas  Schöne  hat  daher  seinen  höchsten  Zweck  in  seiner \r\nEntstehung,  in  seinem  Werden  schon  erreicht;  unser  Nach- \r\ngenuß desselben  ist  nur  eine  Folge  seines  Daseins und \r\n\r\ndas  bildende  Genie  ist  daher  im  großen  Plane  der  Natur \r\nzuerst  um  sein  selbst  und  dann  erst  um  unsertwillen  da; \r\nweil  es  nun  einmal  außer  ihm  noch  Wesen  gibt,  die  selbst \r\nnicht  schaffen  und  bilden,  aber  doch  das  Gebildete,  wenn \r\nes  einmal  hervorgebracht  ist,  mit  ihrer  Einbildungskraft \r\numfassen  können. \r\n\r\nDie  Natur  des  Schönen  besteht  ja  eben  darin,  daß  sein \r\ninnres  Wesen  außer  den  Grenzen  der  Denkkraft,  in  seiner \r\nEntstehung,  in  seinem  eignen  Werden  liegt.  Eben  darum, \r\nweil  die  Denkkraft  beim  Schönen  nicht  mehr  fragen  kann' \r\nwarum  es  schön  sei,  ist  es  schön.  Denn  es  mangelt  ja \r\nder  Denkkraft  völlig  an  einem  Vcrglcichungspunkte,  wor- \r\nnach  sie  das  Schöne  beurteilen  und  betrachten  könnte. \r\nWas  gibt  es  noch  für  einen  Vergleichungspunkt  für  das \r\nechte  Schöne,  als  mit  dem  Inbegriff  aller  harmonischen \r\nVerhältnisse  des  großen  Ganzen  der  Natur,  die  keine  Denk- \r\nkraft umfassen  kann.^\"  Alles  einzelne,  hin  und  her  in  der \r\nNatur  zerstreute  Schöne  ist  ja  nur  insofern  schön,  als  sich \r\ndieser  Inbegriff  aller  Verhältnisse  jenes  großen  Ganzen \r\nmehr  oder  weniger  darin  ofienbart.  Es  kann  also  nie  zum \r\nVergleichungspunkte  für  das  Schöne  der  bildendenKünste, \r\nebensowenig  als  der  wahren  Nachahmung  des  Schönen \r\nzum  Vorbilde  dienen;  weil  das  höchste  Schöne  im  ein- \r\nzelnen der  Natur  immer  noch  nicht  schön  genug  für  die \r\nstolze  Nachahmung  der  großen  und  majestätischen  Ver- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  565 \r\n\r\nhältnisse  des  allumfassenden  Ganzen  der  Natur  ist.  Das \r\nSchöne  kann  daher  nicht  erkannt,  es  muß  /icrz'orgebracht \r\noder  empfunden  werden. \r\n\r\nDenn  weil  in  gänzlicher  Ermanglung  eines  Vergleichungs- \r\npunktes einmal  das  Schöne  kein  Gegenstand  der  Denk- \r\nkraft ist,  so  würden  wir,  insofern  wir  es  nicht  selbst  her- \r\nvorbringen können,  auch  seines  Genusses  ganz  entbehren \r\nmüssen,  indem  wir  uns  nie  an  etwas  halten  könnten,  dem \r\ndas  Schöne  näher  käme  als  das  Minderschöne — wenn \r\nnicht  etwas  die  Stelle  der  hervorbringenden  Kraft  in  uns \r\nersetzte,  das  ihr  so  nahe  wie  möglich  kömmt,  ohne  doch \r\nsie  selbst  zu  sein: — dies  ist  nun,  was  wir  Geschmack  oder \r\nEmpfindungsfähigkeit  für  das  Schöne  nennen,  die,  wenn \r\nsie  in  ihren  Grenzen  bleibt,  den  Mangel  des  höhern  Ge- \r\nnusses bei  der  Hervorbriugung  des  Schönen  durch  die \r\nungestörte  Ruhe  der  stillen  Betrachtung  ersetzen  kann. \r\nWenn  nämlich  das  Organ  nicht  fein  genug  gewebt  ist,  um \r\ndem  einströmenden  Ganzen  der  Natur  so  viele  Berüh- \r\nrungspunkte darzubieten,  als  nötig  sind,  um  alle  ihre \r\ngroßen  Verhältnisse  vollständig  im  kleinen  abzuspiegeln, \r\nund  uns  noch  ein  Punkt  zum  völligen  Schluß  des  Zirkels \r\nfehlt,  so  können  wir  statt  der  Bildungskraft  nur  Empfin- \r\ndungsfähigkeit für  das  Schöne  haben:  jeder  Versuch,  es \r\naußer  uns  wieder  darzustellen,  würde  uns  mißlingen  und \r\nuns  desto  unzufriedener  mit  uns  selber  machen,  je  näher \r\nunser  Empfindungsvermögen  für  das  Schöne  an  das  uns \r\nmangelnde  Bildungsvermögen  grenzt. \r\nWeil  nämlich  das  Wesen  des  Schönen  eben  in  seiner  Voll- \r\nendung in  sich  selbst  besteht,  so  schadet  ihm  der  letzte \r\nfehlende  Punkt  so  viel  als  tausend;  denn  er  verrückt  alle \r\nübrigen  Punkte  aus  der  Stelle,  in  welche  sie  gehören. \r\nUnd  ist  dieser  Vollendungspunkt  einmal  verfehlt,  so  ver- \r\nlohnt ein  Werk  der  Kunst  der  Mühe  des  Anfangs  und  der \r\nZeit  seines  Werdens  nicht;  es  fällt  unter  das  Schlechte \r\nbis  zum  Unnützen  herab,  und  sein  Dasein  muß  notwendig \r\ndurch  die  Vergessenheit,  worin  es  sinkt,  sich  wieder  auf- \r\nheben. \r\n\r\nEbenso  schadet  auch  dem  in  das  feinere  Gewebe  der  Or- \r\nganisation gepflanzten  Bildungsvermögen   der   letzte   zu \r\n\r\n\r\n5  6  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nseiner  Vollständigkeit  fehlende  Punkt  so  viel  als  tausend. \r\nDer  höchste  Wert,  den  es  als  Empfindungsvermögen  haben \r\nkönnte,  kömmt  bei  ihm,  als  Biidungskraft,  ebensowenig \r\nwie  der  geringste  in  Betrachtung.  Auf  dem  Punkte,  wo \r\ndas  Empfindungsvermögen  seine  Grenzen  überschreitet, \r\nmuß  es  notwendig  unter  sich  selber  sinken,  sich  aufheben \r\nund  vernichten. \r\n\r\nJe  voUkommner  das  Empfindungsvermögen  für  eine  ge- \r\nwisse Gattung  des  Schönen  ist,  um  desto  mehr  ist  es  in \r\nGefahr,  sich  zu  täuschen,  sich  selbst  für  Bildungskraft  zu \r\nnehmen  und  auf  die  Weise  durch  tausend  mißlungene \r\nVersuche  seinen  Frieden  mit  sich  selbst  zu  stören. \r\nEs  blickt  z.  B.  beim  Genuß  des  Schönen  in  irgend  einem \r\nWerke  der  Kunst  zugleich  durch  das  Werden  desselben \r\nin  die  bildende  Kraft,  die  es  schuf,  hindurch  und  ahnet \r\ndunkel  den  höhern  Grad  des  Genusses  eben  dieses  Schö- \r\nnen, im  Gefühl  dieser  Kraft,  die  mächtig  genug  war,  es \r\naus  sich  selbst  hervorzubringen. \r\n\r\nUm  sich  nun  diesen  höhern  Grad  des  Genusses,  welchen \r\nsie  an  einem  Werke,  das  einmal  schon  da  ist,  unmöglich \r\nhaben  kann,  auch  zu  verschaßen,  strebt  die  einmal  zu \r\nlebhaft  gerührte  Empfindung  vergebens,  etwas  Ähnliches \r\naus  sich  selbst  hervorzubringen,  haßt  ihr  eignes  Werk, \r\nverwirft  es  und  verleidet  sich  zugleich  den  Genuß  alle  des \r\nSchönen,  das  außer  ihr  schon  da  ist  und  woran  sie  nun \r\neben  deswegen,  weil  es  ohne  ihr  Zutun  da  ist,  keine \r\nFreude  findet. \r\n\r\nIhr  einziger  Wunsch  und  Streben  ist,  des  ihr  versagten \r\nhöhern  Genusses,  den  sie  nur  dunkel  ahnet,  teilhaftig  zu \r\nwerden:  in  einem  schönen  Werke,  das  ihr  sein  Dasein \r\ndankt,  mit  dem  Bewußtsein  von  eigner  Bildungskraft  sich \r\nselbst  zu  spiegeln. \r\n\r\nAllein  sie  wird  ihres  Wunsches  ewig  nicht  gewährt,  weil \r\nEigennutz  ihn  erzeugte  und  das  Schöne  sich  nur  um  sein \r\nselbst  willen  von  der  Hand  des  Künstlers  greifen  und \r\nwillig  und  folgsam  von  ihm  sich  bilden  läßt. \r\nWo  sich  nun  in  den  schaffenwollenden  Bildungstrieb  so- \r\ngleich die  Vorstellung  vom  Gcmiß  des  Schönen  mischt, \r\nden  es,  wenn  es  vollendet  ist,  gewähren  soll,  und  wo  diese \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  567 \r\n\r\nVorstellung  der  erste  und  stärkste  Antrieb  unsrer  Tatkraft \r\nwird,  die  sich  zu  dem,  was  sie  beginnt,  nicht  in  und  durch \r\nsich  selbst  gedrungen  fühlt,  da  ist  der  Bildungstrieb  ge- \r\nwiß nicht  rein:  der  Brennpunkt  oder  Vollendungspunkt \r\ndes  Schönen  fällt  in  die  IVirkiwg  über  das  Werk  hinaus; \r\ndie  Strahlen  gehen  auseinander;  das  Werk  kann  sich  nicht \r\nin  sich  selber  runden. \r\n\r\nDem  höchsten  Genuß  des  aus  sich  selbst  hervorgebrach- \r\nten Schönen  sich  so  nah  zu  dünken,  und  doch  darauf \r\nVerzicht  zu  tun,  scheint  freilich  ein  harter  Kampf — der \r\ndennoch  äußerst  leicht  wird,  wenn  wir  aus  diesem  Bil- \r\ndungstriebe, den  wir  uns  einmal  zu  besitzen  schmeicheln, \r\num  doch  sein  Wesen  zu  veredeln,  jede  Spur  des  Eigen- \r\nnutzes, die  wir  noch  finden,  tilgen  und  jede  Vorstellung \r\ndes  Genusses,  den  uns  das  Schöne,  das  wir  hervorbringen \r\nwollen,  wenn  es  nun  da  sein  wird,  durch  das  Gefühl  von \r\nunsrer  eignen  Kraft  gewähren  soll,  soviel  wie  möglich  zu \r\nverbannen  suchen,  so  daß,  wenn  wir  auch  mit  dem  letzten \r\nAtemzuge  es  erst  vollenden  könnten,  es  dennoch  zu  voll- \r\nenden strebten. \r\n\r\nBehält  alsdann  das  Schöne,  das  wir  ahnen,  bloß  an  und \r\nfür  sich  selbst,  in  seiner  Hervorbringimg,  noch  Reiz  ge- \r\nnug, unsre  Tatkraft  zu  bewegen,  so  dürfen  wir  getrost \r\nunserm  Bildungstriebe  folgen,  weil  er  echt  und  rein  ist. \r\nVerliert  sich  aber  mit  der  gänzlichen  Hinwegdenkung  des \r\nGenusses  und  der  Wirkung  auch  der  Reiz,  so  bedarf  es \r\nja  keines  Kampfes  weiter:  der  Frieden  in  uns  ist  herge- \r\nstellt, und  das  nun  wieder  in  seine  Rechte  getretene  Emp- \r\nfindungsvermögen eröffnet  sich  zum  Lohne  für  sein  be- \r\nscheidnes Zurücktreten  in  seine  Grenzen  dem  reinsten \r\nGenuß  des  Schönen,  der  mit  der  Natur  seines  Wesens \r\nbestehen  kann. \r\n\r\nFreilich  kann  nun  der  Punkt,  wo  Bildungs-  und  Empfin- \r\ndungskraft sich  schneidet,  so  äußerst  leicht  verfehlt  imd \r\nüberschritten  werden,  daß  es  gar  nicht  zu  verwundern  ist, \r\nwenn  immer  tausend  falsche,  angemaßte  Abdrücke  des \r\nhöchsten  Schönen,  gegen  einen  echten,  durch  den  falschen \r\nBildungstrieb  in  den  Werken  der  Kunst  entstehen. \r\nDenn  da  die  echte  Bi^dvmgskraft  sogleich  bei  der  ersten \r\n\r\n\r\n568  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  EI \r\n\r\nEntstehung  ihres  Werks  auch  schon  den  ersten,  höchsten \r\nGenuß  desselben  als  ihren  sichern  Lohn  in  sich  selber \r\nträgt  und  sich  nur  dadurch  von  dem  falschen  Bildungs- \r\ntriebe unterscheidet,  daß  sie  den  allerersten  Moment  ihres \r\nAnstoßes  durch  sich  selber  und  nicht  durch  die  Ahnung \r\ndes  Genusses  von  ihrem  Werke  erhält,  und  weil  in  diesem \r\nMoment  der  Leidenschaft  die  Denkkraft  selbst  kein  rich- \r\ntiges Urteil  fällen  kann,  so  ist  es  fast  unmöglich,  ohne \r\neine  Anzahl  mißlungener  Versuche  dieser  Selbsttäuschung \r\nzu  entkommen. \r\n\r\nUnd  selbst  auch  diese  mißlungenen  Versuche  sind  noch \r\nnicht  immer  ein  Beweis  von  Mangel  an  Bildungskraft,  weil \r\ndiese  selbst  da,  wo  sie  echt  ist,  oft  eine  ganz  falsche \r\nRichtung  nimmt,  indem  sie  vor  ihre  Einbildungskraft \r\nstellen  will,  was  vor  ihr  Auge,  oder  vor  ihr  Auge,  was \r\nvor  ihr  Ohr  gehört. \r\n\r\nEben  weil  die  Natur  die  inwohnende  Bildungskraft  nicht \r\nimmer  zur  völligen  Reife  und  Entwicklung  kommen  oder \r\nsie  einen  falschen  Weg  einschlagen  läßt,  auf  dem  sie  sich \r\nnie  entwickeln  kann,  so  bleibt  das  echte  Schöne  selten. \r\nUnd  weil  sie  auch  aus  dem  angemaßten  Bildungstriebe \r\ndas  Gemeine  und  Schlechte  ungehindert  entstehen  läßt, \r\nso  unterscheidet  sich  eben  dadurch  das  echte  Schöne  und \r\nEdle,  durch  seinen  seltenen  Wert,  vom  Schlechten  und \r\nGemeinen. \r\n\r\nIn  dem  Empfindungsvermögen  bleibt  also  stets  die  Lücke, \r\nwelche  nur  durch  das  Resultat  der  Bildungskraft  sich  aus- \r\nfüllt.— Bildungskraft  und  Empfindungsfähigkeit  verhalten \r\nsich  zueinander  wie  Mann  und  Weib.  Denn  auch  die \r\nBildungskraft  ist  bei  der  ersten  Entstehung  ihres  Werks, \r\nim  Moment  des  höchsten  Genusses,  zugleich  Empfindungs- \r\nfähigkeit und  erzeugt,  wie  die  Natur,  den  Abdruck  ihres \r\nWesens  aus  sich  selber. \r\n\r\nEmpfindungsvermögen  sowohl  als  Bildungskraft  sind  also \r\nin  dem  feinern  Gewebe  der  Organisation  gegründet,  in- \r\nsofern dieselbe  in  allen  ihren  Berühi  ungspunkten  von  den \r\nVerhältnissen  des  großen  Ganzen  der  Natur  ein  vollstän- \r\ndiger oder  doch  fast  vollständiger  Abdruck  ist. \r\nEmpfindungskraft  sowohl  als  Bildunpskraft  umfassen  mehr \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  569 \r\n\r\nals  Denkkraft,  und  die  tätige  Kraft,  worin  sich  beide \r\ngründen,  faßt  zugleich  auch  alles,  was  die  Denkkraft  faßt, \r\nweil  sie  von  allen  Begrifien,  die  wir  je  haben  können,  die \r\nersten  Anlässe,  stets  sie  aus  sich  herausspinnend,  in  sich \r\nträgt. \r\n\r\nInsofern  nun  diese  tätige  Kraft  alles,  was  nicht  unter  das \r\nGebiet  der  Denkkraft  fällt,  hervordringe7id  in  sich  faßt, \r\nheißt  sie  Bildungskraft;  und  insofern  sie  das,  was  außer \r\nden  Grenzen  der  Denkkraft  liegt,  6.qx  Hcrz'orbrhigtiug  sich \r\ncntgegefi  neigefid,  in  sich  begreift,  heißt  sie  Empfindungs- \r\nkraft. \r\n\r\nBildungskraft  kann  nicht  ohne  Empfindung  und  tätige  Kraft, \r\ndie  bloß  tätige  Kraft  hingegen  kann  ohne  eigentliche  Emp- \r\nfindungs-  und  Bildungskraft,  wovon  sie  nur  die  Grund- \r\nlage ist,  für  sich  allein  stattfinden. \r\n\r\nInsofern  nun  diese  bloß  tätige  Kraft  ebenfalls  in  dem \r\nfeinem  Gewebe  der  Organisation  sich  gründet,  darf  das \r\nOrgan  nur  überhaupt  in  alle  seinen  Berührungspunkten  ein \r\nAbdruck  der  Verhältnisse  des  großen  Ganzen  sein,  ohne \r\ndaß  eben  der  Grad  der  Vollständigkeit  erfordert  würde, \r\nwelche  die  Empfindungs-  und  Bildungskraft  voraus- \r\nsetzt. \r\n\r\nVon  den  Verhältnissen  des  großen  Ganzen,  das  uns  um- \r\ngibt, treffen  nämlich  immer  so  viele  in  allen  Berührungs- \r\npunkten unsres  Organs  zusammen,  daß  wir  dies  große \r\nGanze  dunkel  in  uns  fühlen,  ohne  es  doch  selbst  zu  sein. \r\nDie  in  unser  Wesen  hineingesponnenen  Verhältnisse  jenes \r\nGanzen  streben,  sich  nach  allen  Seiten  wieder  auszudeh- \r\nnen; das  Organ  wünscht,  sich  nach  allen  Seiten  bis  ins \r\nUnendliche  fortzusetzen.  Es  will  das  umgebende  Ganze \r\nnicht  nur  in  sich  spiegeln,  sondern,  soweit  es  kann,  selbst \r\ndies  umgebende  Ganze  sein. \r\n\r\nDaher  ergreift  jede  höhere  Organisation  ihrer  Natur  nach \r\ndie  ihr  untergeordnete  und  trägt  sie  in  ihr  Wesen  über: \r\ndie  Pflanze  den  unorganisierten  Stofl'  durch  bloßes  Wer- \r\nden und  Wachsen;  das  Tier  die  Pflanzen  durch  Werden, \r\nWachsen  und  Genuß;  der  Mensch  verwandelt  nicht  nur \r\nTier  und  Pflanze  durch  Werden,  Wachsen  und  Genuß  in \r\nsein  innres  Wesen,  sondern  faßt  zugleich  alles,  was  seiner \r\n\r\n\r\n5  7  o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  HI \r\n\r\nOrganisation  sich  unterordnet,  durch  die  unter  allen  am \r\nhellsten  geschlift'ene  spiegelnde  Oberfläche  seines  Wesens \r\nin  den  Umfang  seines  Daseins  auf  und  stellt  es,  wenn  sein \r\nOrgan  sich  bildend  in  sich  selbst  vollendet,  verschönert \r\naußer  sich  wieder  dar. \r\n\r\nWo  nicht,  so  muß  er  das,  was  um  ihn  her  ist,  durch  Zer- \r\nstörung in  den  Umfang  seines  wirklichen  Daseins  ziehn \r\nund  verheerend  um  sich  greifen,  soweit  er  kann,  da  ein- \r\nmal die  reine  unschuldige  Beschauung  seinen  Durst  nach \r\nausgedehntem  wirklichen  Dasein  nicht  ersetzen  kann.\" \r\n\r\nApril \r\nKorrespondenz \r\n\r\nDen  lo.

Eigentlich  bleibe  ich  noch  um  Kaysers  willen \r\nund  um  Burys  willen.  Ersterer  muß  noch  einige  Studien \r\nabsolvieren,  die  er  nur  hier  in  Rom  machen  kann,  noch \r\neinige  Musikalien  sammeln;  der  andere  muß  noch  die \r\nZeichnung  zu  einem  Gemälde,  nach  meiner  Erfindung,  ins \r\nreine  bringen,  dabei  er  meines  Rats  bedarf. \r\nDoch  hab  ich  den  2 1 .  oder  2  2 .

Kaum \r\nmag  ich  noch  etwas  sehen;  mein  ehrlicher  Meyer  steht \r\nmir  noch  bei,  und  ich  genieße  noch  zuletzt  seines  unter- \r\nrichtenden Umgangs.  Hätte  ich  Kaysern  nicht  bei  mir, \r\nso  hätte  ich  jenen  mitgebracht.  Wenn  wir  ihn  nur  ein \r\nJahr  gehabt  hätten,  so  wären  wir  weit  genug  gekommen. \r\nBesonders  hätte  er  bald  über  alle  Skrupel  im  Köpfe- \r\nzeichnen hinausgeholfen. \r\n\r\nIch  war  mit  meinem  guten  Meyer  diesen  Morgen  in  der \r\nfranzösischen  Akademie,  wo  die  Abgüsse  der  besten  Sta- \r\ntuen des  Altertums  beisammen  stehn.  Wie  könnt  ich  aus- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  571 \r\n\r\ndrücken,  was  ich  hier,  wie  zum  Abschied,  empfand?  In \r\nsolcher  Gegenwart  wird  man  mehr,  als  man  ist;  man \r\nfühlt,  das  Würdigste,  womit  man  sich  beschäftigen  sollte, \r\nsei  die  menschliche  Gestalt,  die  man  hier  in  aller  mannig- \r\nfaltigen Herrlichkeit  gewahr  wird.  Doch  wer  fühlt  bei \r\neinem  solchen  Anblick  nicht  alsobald,  wie  unzulänglich \r\ner  sei;  selbst  vorbereitet  steht  man  wie  vernichtet.  Hatte \r\nich  doch  Proportion,  Anatomie,  Regelmäßigkeit  der  Be- \r\nwegung mir  einigermaßen  zu  verdeutlichen  gesucht,  hier \r\naber  fiel  mir  nur  zu  sehr  auf,  daß  die  Fonn  zuletzt  alles \r\neinschließe,  der  Glieder  Zweckmäßigkeit,  Verhältnis,  Cha- \r\nrakter und  Schönheit. \r\n\r\nDen  14.

Indem \r\nich  nicht  abließ,  an  jenem  Fuß  fort  zu  modellieren,  ging \r\nmir  auf,  daß  ich  nunmelir  Tasso  unmittelbar  angreifen \r\nmüßte,  zu  dem  sich  denn  auch  meine  Gedanken  hinwen- \r\ndeten— ein  willkommener  Gefährte  zur  bevorstehenden \r\nReise.  Dazwischen  wird  eingepackt,  und  man  sieht  in \r\nsolchem  Augenbhcke  erst,  was  man  alles  um  sich  ver- \r\nsammelt und  zusammengeschleppt  hat. \r\n\r\n\r\nBericht \r\n\r\nApril \r\nMeine  Korrespondenz  der  letzten  Wochen  bietet  wenig \r\nBedeutendes;  meine  Lage  war  zu  verwickelt  zwischen \r\nKunst  und  Freundschaft,  zwischen  Besitz  und  Bestreben, \r\nzwischen  einer  gewohnten  Gegenwart  und  einer  wieder \r\nneu  anzugewöhnenden  Zukunft.  In  diesen  Zuständen  konn- \r\nten meine  Briefe  wenig  enthalten;  die  Freude,  meine  alten \r\ngeprüften  Freunde  wieder  zu  sehen,  war  nur  mäßig  aus- \r\ngesprochen, der  Schmerz  des  Loslösens  dagegen  kaum \r\nverheimlicht.  Ich  fasse  daher  in  gegenwärtigen  nachträg- \r\nlichen Bericht  manches  zusammen  und  nehme  nxa  das \r\nauf,  was  aus  jener  Zeit  mir  teils  durch  andere  Papiere  und \r\nDenkmale  bewahrt,  teils  in  der  Erinnerung  wieder  hervor- \r\nzurufen ist. \r\n\r\n\r\n5  7  2  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nTischbein  verweilte  noch  immer  in  Neapel,  ob  er  schon \r\nseine  Zurückkunft  im  Frühling  wiederholt  angekündigt \r\nhatte.  Es  war  sonst  mit  ihm  gut  leben,  nur  ein  gewisser \r\nTik  ward  auf  die  Länge  beschwerlich.  Er  ließ  nämlich \r\nalles,  was  er  zu  tun  vorhatte,  in  einer  Art  Unbestimmt- \r\nheit, wodurch  er  oft,  ohne  eigentlich  bösen  Willen,  an- \r\ndere zu  Schaden  und  Unlust  brachte.  So  erging  es  mir \r\nnun  auch  in  diesem  Falle:  ich  mußte,  wenn  er  zurück- \r\nkehrte, um  uns  alle  bequem  logiert  zu  sehen,  das  Quar- \r\ntier verändern,  und  da  die  obere  Etage  unsers  Hauses \r\neben  leer  ward,  säumte  ich  nicht,  sie  zu  mieten  und  sie \r\nzu  beziehen,  damit  er  bei  seiner  Ankunft  in  der  untern \r\nalles  bereit  fände. \r\n\r\nDie  oberen  Räume  waren  den  unteren  gleich,  die  hintere \r\nSeite  jedoch  hatte  den  Vorteil  einer  allerliebsten  Aus- \r\nsicht über  den  Hausgarten  und  die  Gärten  der  Nachbar- \r\nschaft, welche,  da  unser  Haus  ein  Eckhaus  war,  sich  nach \r\nallen  Seiten  ausdehnte. \r\n\r\nHier  sah  man  nun  die  verschiedensten  Gärten,  regel- \r\nmäßig durch  Mauern  getrennt,  in  unendlicher  Mannig- \r\nfaltigkeit gehalten  und  bepflanzt;  dieses  grünende  und \r\nblühende  Paradies  zu  verherrlichen,  trat  überall  die  ein- \r\nfach edle  Baukunst  hervor:  Gartensäle,  Balkone,  Ter- \r\nrassen, auch  auf  den  höhern  Hinterhäuschen  eine  offne \r\nLoge,  dazwischen  alle  Baum-  und  Pflanzenarten  der  Ge- \r\ngend. \r\n\r\nIn  unserm  Hausgarten  versorgte  ein  alter  Weltgeistlicher \r\neine  Anzahl  wohlgehaltener  Zitronenbäume,  von  mäßiger \r\nHöhe,  in  verzierten  Vasen  von  gebrannter  Erde,  welche \r\nim  Sommer  der  freien  Luft  genossen,  im  Winter  jedoch \r\nim  Gartensaale  verwahrt  standen.  Nach  vollkommen  ge- \r\nprüfter Reife  wurden  die  Früchte  sorgfältig  abgenommen, \r\njede  einzeln  in  weiches  Papier  gewickelt,  so  zusammen- \r\ngepackt und  versendet.  Sie  sind  wegen  besonderer  Vor- \r\nzüge im  Handel  beliebt.  Eine  solche  Orangerie  wird  als \r\nein  kleines  Kapital  in  bürgerHchen  Familien  betrachtet, \r\nwovon  man  alle  Jahre  die  gewissen  Interessen  zieht. \r\nDieselbigen  Fenster,  aus  welchen  man  so  viel  Anmut \r\nbeim  klarsten  Himmel  ungestört  betrachtete,  gaben  auch \r\n\r\n\r\nROM17SS  573 \r\n\r\nein  vortrefi'liches  Licht  zu  Beschauung  malerischer  Kunst- \r\nwerke. Soeben  hatte  Kniep  verschiedene  Aquarellzeich- \r\nnungen, ausgeführt  nach  Umrissen,  die  er  auf  unsrer \r\nReise  durch  Sizilien  sorgfältig  zog,  verabredetermaßen \r\neingesendet,  die  nunmehr  bei  dem  günstigsten  Licht  allen \r\nTeilnehmenden  zu  Freude  und  Bewunderung  gereichten. \r\nKlarheit  und  luftige  Haltung  ist  vielleicht  in  dieser  Art \r\nkeinem  besser  gelungen  als  ihm,  der  sich  mit  Neigung  ge- \r\nrade hierauf  geworfen  hatte.  Die  Ansicht  dieser  Blätter \r\nbezauberte  wirklich:  denn  man  glaubte  die  Feuchte  des \r\nMeers,  die  blauen  Schatten  der  Felsen,  die  gelbrötlichen \r\nTöne  der  Gebirge,  das  Verschweben  der  Feme  in  dem \r\nglanzreichsten  Himmel  wieder  zu  sehen,  wieder  zu  emp- \r\nfinden. Aber  nicht  allein  diese  Blätter  erschienen  in  sol- \r\nchem Grade  günstig,  jedes  Gemälde,  auf  dieselbe  Staf- \r\nfelei, an  denselben  Ort  gestellt,  erschien  wirksamer  und \r\nauffallender;  ich  erinnere  mich,  daß  einigemal,  als  ich \r\nins  Zimmer  trat,  mir  ein  solches  Bild  wie  zauberisch  ent- \r\ngegenwirkte. \r\n\r\nDas  Geheimnis  einer  günstigen  oder  ungünstigen,  direk- \r\nten oder  indirekten  atmosphärischen  Beleuchtung  war \r\ndamals  noch  nicht  entdeckt,  sie  selbst  aber  durchaus  ge- \r\nfühlt, angestaunt  und  als  nur  zufällig  und  unerklärbar  be- \r\ntrachtet. \r\n\r\nDiese  neue  Wohnung  gab  nun  Gelegenheit,  eine  Anzahl \r\nvon  Gipsabgüssen,  die  sich  nach  und  nach  um  uns  ge- \r\nsammelt hatten,  in  freundlicher  Ordnung  und  gutem \r\nLichte  aufzustellen,  und  man  genoß  jetzt  erst  eines  höchst \r\nwürdigen  Besitzes.  Wenn  man,  wie  in  Rom  der  Fall  ist, \r\nsich  immerfort  in  Gegenwart  plastischer  Kunstwerke  der \r\nAlten  befindet,  so  fühlt  man  sich,  wie  in  Gegenwart  der \r\nNatur,  vor  einem  Unendlichen,  Unerforschlichen.  Der \r\nEindruck  des  Erhabenen,  des  Schönen,  so  wohltätig  er \r\nauch  sein  mag,  beunruhigt  uns,  wir  wünschen  unsre  Ge- \r\nfühle, unsre  Anschauung  in  Worte  zu  fassen:  dazu  müß- \r\nten wir  aber  erst  erkennen,  einsehen,  begreifen;  wir  fan- \r\ngen an,  zu  sondern,  zu  unterscheiden,  zu  ordnen,  und  auch \r\ndieses  finden  wir,  wo  nicht  unmöglich,  doch  höchst  schwie- \r\n\r\n\r\n5  7  4  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  in \r\n\r\nrig,  und  so  kehren  wir  endlich  zu  einer  schauenden  und \r\ngenießenden  Bewunderung  zurück. \r\n\r\nÜberhaupt  aber  ist  dies  die  entschiedenste  Wirkung  aller \r\nKunstwerke,  daß  sie  uns  in  den  Zustand  der  Zeit  und  der \r\nIndividuen  versetzen^  die  sie  hervorbrachten.  Umgeben \r\nvon  antiken  Statuen  empfindet  man  sich  in  einem  be- \r\nwegten Naturleben:  man  wird  die  Mannigfaltigkeit  der \r\nMenschengestaltung  gewahr  und  durchaus  auf  den  Men- \r\nschen in  seinem  reinsten  Zustande  zurückgeführt,  wo- \r\ndurch denn  der  Beschauer  selbst  lebendig  und  rein  mensch- \r\nlich wird.  Selbst  die  Bekleidung,  der  Natur  angemessen, \r\ndie  Gestalt  gewissermaßen  noch  hervorhebend,  tut  im \r\nallgemeinen  Sinne  wohl.  Kann  man  dergleichen  Umge- \r\nbung in  Rom  tagtäglich  genießen,  so  wird  man  zugleich \r\nhabsüchtig  darnach;  man  verlangt  solche  Gebilde  neben \r\nsich  aufzustellen,  und  gute  Gipsabgüsse,  als  die  eigent- \r\nlichsten Faksimiles,  geben  hiezu  die  beste  Gelegenheit. \r\nWenn  man  des  Morgens  die  Augen  aufschlägt,  fühlt  man \r\nsich  von  dem  Vortrefflichsten  gerührt;  alles  unser  Den- \r\nken und  Sinnen  ist  von  solchen  Gestalten  begleitet,  und \r\nes  wird  dadurch  unmöglich,  in  Barbarei  zurückzufallen. \r\nDen  ersten  Platz  bei  uns  behauptete  Juno  Ludovisi,  um \r\ndesto  höher  geschätzt  und  verehrt,  als  man  das  Original \r\nnur  selten,  nur  zufällig  zu  sehen  bekam  und  man  es  für \r\nein  Glück  achten  mußte,  sie  immerwährend  vor  Augen \r\nzu  haben;  denn  keiner  unsrer  Zeitgenossen,  der  zum  er- \r\nstenmal vor  sie  hintritt,  darf  behaupten,  diesem  Anblick \r\ngewachsen  zu  sein. \r\n\r\nNoch  einige  kleinere  Junonen  standen  zur  Vergleichung \r\nneben  ihr,  vorzüglich  Büsten  Jupiters  und,  um  anderes \r\nzu  übergehen,  ein  guter  alter  Abguß  der  Medusa  Ron- \r\ndanini; ein  wundersames  Werk,  das,  den  Zwiespalt  zwi- \r\nschen Tod  und  Leben,  zwischen  Schmerz  und  Wollust \r\nausdrückend,  einen  unnennbaren  Reiz  wie  irgend  ein  an- \r\nderes Problem  über  uns  ausübt. \r\n\r\nDoch  erwähn  ich  noch  eines  Herkules  Anax,  so  kräftig \r\nund  groß  als  verständig  und  mild;  sodann  eines  allerlieb- \r\nsten Merkur,  deren  beider  Originale  sich  jetzt  in  England \r\nbefinden. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  575 \r\n\r\nHalberhobene  Arbeiten,  Abgüsse  von  manchen  schönen \r\nWerken  gebrannter  Erde,  auch  die  ägyptischen,  von  dem \r\nGipfel  des  großen  Obelisk  genommen,  und  was  nicht \r\nsonst  an  Fragmenten,  worunter  einige  marmorne  waren, \r\nstanden  wohl  eingereiht  umher. \r\n\r\nIch  spreche  von  diesen  Schätzen,  welche  nur  wenige \r\nWochen  in  die  neue  Wohnung  gereiht  standen,  wie  einer, \r\nder  sein  Testament  überdenkt,  den  ihn  umgebenden  Be- \r\nsitz mit  Fassung,  aber  doch  gerührt  ansehen  wird.  Die \r\nUmständlichkeit,  die  Bemühung  und  Kosten  und  eine  ge- \r\nwisse Unbehülflichkeit  in  solchen  Dingen  hielten  mich  ab, \r\ndas  Vorzüglichste  sogleich  nach  Deutschland  zu  bestim- \r\nmen. Juno  Ludovisi  war  der  edlen  Angelica  zugedacht, \r\nweniges  andere  den  nächsten  Künstlern;  manches  gehörte \r\nnoch  zu  den  Tischbeinischen  Besitzungen,  anderes  sollte \r\nunangetastet  bleiben  und  von  Bury,  der  das  Quartier  nach \r\nmir  bezog,  nach  seiner  Weise  benutzt  werden. \r\nIndem  ich  dieses  niederschreibe,  werden  meine  Gedan- \r\nken in  die  frühsten  Zeiten  hingeführt  und  die  Gelegen- \r\nheiten hervorgerufen,  die  mich  anfänglich  mit  solchen \r\nGegenständen  bekannt  machten,  meinen  Anteil  erregten, \r\nbei  einem  völlig  ungenügenden  Denken  einen  über- \r\nschwenglichen Enthusiasmus  hervorriefen  und  die  gren- \r\nzenlose Sehnsucht  nach  Italien  zur  Folge  hatten. \r\nIn  meiner  frühsten  Jugend  ward  ich  nichts  Plastisches \r\nin  meiner  Vaterstadt  gewahr;  in  Leipzig  machte  zuerst \r\nder  gleichsam  tanzend  auftretende,  die  Zimbeln  schla- \r\ngende Faun  einen  tiefen  Eindruck,  so  daß  ich  mir  den \r\nAbguß  noch  jetzt  in  seiner  Individualität  und  Umgebung \r\ndenken  kann.  Nach  einer  langen  Pause  ward  ich  auf  ein- \r\nmal in  das  volle  Meer  gestürzt,  als  ich  mich  von  der \r\nMannheimer  Sammlung,  in  dem  von  oben  wohlbeleuch- \r\nteten Saale,  plötzlich  umgeben  sah. \r\nNachher  fanden  sich  Gipsgießer  in  Frankfurt  ein;  sie  hat- \r\nten sich  mit  manchen  Originalabgüssen  über  die  Alpen \r\nbegeben,  welche  sie  sodann  abformten  und  die  Originale \r\nfür  einen  leidlichen  Preis  abließen.  So  erhielt  ich  einen \r\nziemlich  guten  Laokoonskopf,  Niobes  Tochter,  ein  Köpf- \r\nchen, später  für  eine  Sappho  angesprochen,  und  noch \r\n\r\n\r\n5  7  6  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nsonst  einiges.  Diese  edlen  Gestalten  waren  eine  Art  von \r\nheimlichem  Gegengift,  wenn  das  Schwache,  Falsche,  Ma- \r\nnierierte über  mich  zu  gewinnen  drohte.  Eigentlich  aber \r\nempfand  ich  immer  innerliche  Schmerzen  eines  unbe- \r\nfriedigten, sich  aufs  Unbekannte  beziehenden,  oft  ge- \r\ndämpften und  immer  wieder  auflebenden  Verlangens. \r\nGroß  war  der  Schmerz  daher,  als  ich,  aus  Rom  schei- \r\ndend, von  dem  Besitz  des  endlich  Erlangten,  sehnlichst \r\nGehofften  mich  lostrennen  sollte. \r\n\r\nDie  Gesetzlichkeit  der  Pflanzenorganisation,  die  ich  in \r\nSizilien  gewahr  worden,  beschäftigte  mich  zwischen  allem \r\ndurch,  wie  es  Neigungen  zu  tun  pflegen,  die  sich  unsres \r\nInnern  bemächtigen  und  sich  zugleich  unsern  Fähigkeiten \r\nangemessen  erzeigen.  Ich  besuchte  den  botanischen  Gar- \r\nten, welcher,  wenn  man  will,  in  seinem  veralteten  Zu- \r\nstande geringen  Reiz  ausübte,  auf  mich  aber  doch,  dem \r\nvieles,  was  er  dort  vorfand,  neu  und  unerwartet  schien, \r\neinen  günstigen  Einfluß  hatte.  Ich  nahm  daher  Gelegen- \r\nheit, manche  seltenere  Pflanzen  um  mich  zu  versammeln \r\nund  meine  Betrachtungen  darüber  fortzusetzen,  sowie \r\ndie  von  mir  aus  Samen  und  Kernen  erzogenen  fernerhin \r\npflegend  zu  beobachten. \r\n\r\nIn  diese  letzten  besonders  wollten  bei  meiner  Abreise \r\nmehrere  Freunde  sich  teilen.  Ich  pflanzte  den  schon  ei- \r\nnigermaßen erwachsenen  Piniensprößling,  Vorbildchen \r\neines  künftigen  Baumes,  bei  Angelica  in  den  Haus- \r\ngarten, wo  er  durch  manche  Jahre  zu  einer  ansehnlichen \r\nHöhe  gedieh,  wovon  mir  teilnehmende  Reisende  zu \r\nwechselseitigem  Vergnügen,  wie  auch  von  meinem  An- \r\ndenken an  jenem  Platze,  gar  manches  zu  erzählen  wuß- \r\nten. Leider  fand  der  nach  dem  Ableben  jener  unschätz- \r\nbaren Freundin  eintretende  neue  Besitzer  es  unpassend, \r\nauf  seinen  Blumenbeeten  ganz  unörtlich  Pinien  her- \r\nvorwachsen zu  sehen.  Späterhin  fanden  wohlwollende, \r\ndarnach  forschende  Reisende  die  Stelle  leer  und  hier \r\nwenigstens  die  Spur  eines  anmutigen  Daseins  ausge- \r\nlöscht. \r\nGlücklicher   waren   einige   Dattelpflanzen,    die   ich   aus \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  577 \r\n\r\nKernen  gezogen  hatte.  Wie  ich  denn  überhaupt  die  merk- \r\nwürdige Entwicklung  derselben  durch  Aufopferung  meh- \r\nrerer Exemplare  von  Zeit  zu  Zeit  beobachtete;  die  über- \r\nbliebenen  frisch  aufgeschossenen  übergab  ich  einem  rö- \r\nmischen Freunde,  der  sie  in  einen  Garten  der  Sixtinischen \r\nStraße  pflanzte,  wo  sie  noch  am  Leben  sind,  und  zwar \r\nbis  zur  Manneshöhe  herangewachsen,  wie  ein  erhabener \r\nReisender  mir  zu  versichern  die  Gnade  hatte.  Mögen \r\nsie  den  Besitzern  nicht  unbequem  werden  und  fernerhin \r\nzu  meinem  Andenken  grünen,  wachsen  und  gedeihen. \r\n\r\nAuf  dem  Verzeichnisse,  was  vor  der  Abreise  von  Rom \r\nallenfalls  nachzuholen  sein  möchte,  fanden  sich  zuletzt \r\nsehr  disparate  Gegenstände,  die  Cloaca  Massima  und  die \r\nKatakomben  bei  St.  Sebastian.  Die  erste  erhöhte  wohl \r\nnoch  den  kolossalen  Begriff,  wozu  uns  Piranesi  vorberei- \r\ntet hatte;  der  Besuch  des  zweiten  Lokals  geriet  jedoch \r\nnicht  zum  besten:  denn  die  ersten  Schritte  in  diese  dump- \r\nfigen Räume  erregten  mir  alsobald  ein  solches  Mißbeha- \r\ngen, daß  ich  sogleich  wieder  ans  Tageslicht  hervorstieg \r\nund  dort,  im  Freien,  in  einer  ohnehin  unbekannten,  fer- \r\nnen Gegend  der  Stadt,  die  Rückkunft  der  übrigen  Gesell- \r\nschaft abwartete,  welche,  gefaßter  als  ich,  die  dortigen \r\nZustände  getrost  beschauen  mochte. \r\nIn  dem  großen  Werke:  Roma  sotterranea,  di  Antonio \r\nBosio,  Romano,  belehrt  ich  mich  lange  Zeit  nachher  um- \r\nständlich von  allem  dem,  was  ich  dort  gesehen  oder  auch \r\nwohl  nicht  gesehen  hätte,  und  glaubte  mich  dadurch  hin- \r\nlänglich entschädigt. \r\n\r\nEine  andere  Wallfahrt  wurde  dagegen  mit  mehr  Nutzen \r\nund  Folge  unternommen:  es  war  zu  der  Akademie  San \r\nLuca,  dem  Schädel  Raffaels  unsre  Verehrung  zu  bezei- \r\ngen, welcher  dort  als  ein  Heiligtum  aufbewahrt  wird, \r\nseitdem  er  aus  dem  Grabe  dieses  außerordentlichen  Man- \r\nnes, das  man  bei  einer  baulichen  Angelegenheit  eröffnet \r\nhatte,  daselbst  entfernt  und  hierher  gebracht  worden. \r\nEin  wahrhaft  wundersamer  Anblick!  Eine  so  schön  als \r\nnur  denkbar  zusammengefaßte  und  abgerundete  Schale, \r\nohne  eine  Spur  von  jenen  Erhöhungen,  Beulen  und  Buk- \r\n\r\nGOETHE  IV  37 \r\n\r\n\r\n5  7  8  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nkein,  welche,  später  an  andern  Schädeln  bemerkt,  in  der \r\nGallischen  Lehre  zu  so  mannigfaltiger  Bedeutung  ge- \r\nworden sind.  Ich  konnte  mich  von  dem  Anblick  nicht \r\nlosreißen  und  bemerkte  beim  Weggehen,  wie  bedeutend \r\nes  für  Natur-  und  Kunstfreunde  sein  müßte,  einen  x\\b- \r\nguß  davon  zu  haben,  wenn  es  irgend  möglich  wäre.  Hof- \r\nrat Reiffenstein,  dieser  einflußreiche  Freund,  gab  mir \r\nHoffnung  und  erfüllte  sie  nach  einiger  Zeit,  indem  er \r\nmir  wirklich  einen  solchen  Abguß  nach  Deutschland»  sen- \r\ndete, dessen  Anblick  mich  noch  oft  zu  den  -mannigfaltig- \r\nsten Betrachtungen  aufruft. \r\n\r\nDas  liebenswürdige  Bild  von  des  Künstlers  Hand,  St. \r\nLukas,  dem  die  Mutter  Gottes  erscheint,  damit  er  sie  in \r\nihrer  vollen  göttlichen  Hoheit  und  Anmut  wahr  und  na- \r\ntürlich darstellen  möge,  gewährte  den  heitersten  Anblick. \r\nRaffael  selbst,  noch  jung,  steht  in  einiger  Entfernung  und \r\nsieht  dem  Evangelisten  bei  der  Arbeit  zu.  Anmutiger \r\nkann  man  wohl  nicht  einen  Beruf,  zu  dem  man  sich  ent- \r\nschieden hingezogen  fühlt,  ausdrücken  und  bekennen. \r\nPeter  von  Cortona  war  ehmals  der  Besitzer  dieses  Werks \r\nund  hat  solches  der  Akademie  vermacht.  Es  ist  freilich \r\nan  manchen  Stellen  beschädigt  und  restauriert,  aber  doch \r\nimmer  ein  Gemälde  von  bedeutendem  Wert. \r\n\r\nIn  diesen  Tagen  jedoch  ward  ich  durch  eine  ganz  eigene \r\nVersuchung  geprüft,  die  meine  Reise  zu  verhindern  und \r\nmich  in  Rom  aufs  neue  zu  fesseln  drohte.  Es  kam  näm- \r\nlich von  Neapel  Herr  Antonio  Rega,  Künstler  und  eben- \r\nfalls Kunsthändler,  zu  Freund  Meyer,  ihm  vertraulich \r\nankündigend,  er  sei  mit  einem  Schifte  hier  angekommen, \r\nwelches  draußen  an  Ripa  grande  liege,  wohin  er  ihn  mit- \r\nzugehen hiedurch  einlade;  denn  er  habe  auf  demselben \r\neine  bedeutende  antike  Statue,  jene  Tänzerin  oder  Muse, \r\nwelche  in  Neapel  im  Hofe  des  Palasts  Carafta  Colubrano \r\nnebst  andern  in  einer  Nische  seit  undenklichen  Jahren \r\ngestanden  und  durchaus  für  ein  gutes  Werk  gehalten \r\nworden  sei.  Er  wünsche  diese  zu  verkaufen,  aber  in  der \r\nStille,  und  frage  deshalb  an,  ob  nicht  etwa  Herr  Meyer \r\nselbst  oder  einer  seiner  vertrauten  Freunde  sich  zu  die- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM17S8  5  79 \r\n\r\nsein  Handel  entschließen  könnte.  Er  biete  das  edle \r\nKunstwerk  zu  einem  auf  alle  Fälle  höchst  mäßigen  Preise \r\nvon  dreihundert  Zechinen,  welche  Forderung  sich  ohne \r\nFrage  erhöhen  möchte,  wenn  man  nicht  in  Betracht  der \r\nVerkäufer  und  des  Käufers  mit  Vorsicht  zu  verfahren \r\nUrsache  hätte. \r\n\r\nMir  ward  die  Sache  sogleich  mitgeteilt,  und  wir  eilten \r\nselbdritte  zu  dem  von  unsrer  Wohnung  ziemlich  entfernten \r\nLandungsplatz.  Rega  hub  sogleich  ein  Brett  von  der \r\nKiste,  die  auf  dem  Verdeck  stand,  und  wir  sahen  ein \r\nallerliebstes  Köpfchen,  das  noch  nie  vom  Rumpfe  ge- \r\ntrennt gewesen,  unter  freien  Haarlocken  hervorblickend, \r\nund  nach  und  nach  aufgedeckt  eine  lieblich  bewegte  Ge- \r\nstalt, im  anständigsten  Gewände,  übrigens  wenig  versehrt \r\nund  die  eine  Hand  vollkommen  gut  erhalten. \r\nSogleich  erinnerten  wir  uns  recht  gut,  sie  an  Ort  und \r\nStelle  gesehen  zu  haben,  ohne  zu  ahnen,  daß  sie  uns  je \r\nso  nah  kommen  könnte. \r\n\r\nHier  nun  fiel  uns  ein — und  wem  hätte  es  nicht  einfallen \r\nsollen? — :  Gewiß,  sagten  wir,  wenn  man  ein  ganzes  Jahr \r\nmit  bedeutenden  Kosten  gegraben  hätte  und  zuletzt  auf \r\neinen  solchen  Schatz  gestoßen  wäre,  man  hätte  sich  höchst \r\nglücklich  gefunden.  Wir  konnten  uns  kaum  von  der  Be- \r\ntrachtung losreißen;  denn  ein  so  reines  wohlerhaltenes \r\nAltertum  in  einem  leicht  zu  restaurierenden  Zustande \r\nkam  uns  wohl  niemals  zu  Gesicht.  Doch  schieden  wir \r\nzuletzt  mit  Vorsatz  und  Zusage,  baldigste  Antwort  ver- \r\nnehmen zu  lassen. \r\n\r\nWir  waren  beiderseits  in  einem  wahrhaften  Kampf  be- \r\ngriffen, es  schien  uns  in  mancher  Betrachtung  unrätlich, \r\ndiesen  Ankauf  zu  machen;  wir  entschlossen  uns  daher, \r\nden  Fall  der  guten  Frau  /Vngelica  zu  melden,  als  wohl \r\nvermögend  zum  Ankauf  und  durch  ihre  Verbindung  zu \r\nRestauration  und  sonstigen  Vorkommenheiten  hinlänglich \r\ngeeignet.  Meyer  übernahm  die  Meldung,  wie  früher  die \r\nwegen  des  Bildes  von  Daniel  von  Volterra,  und  wir  hoff- \r\nten deshalb  das  beste  Gelingen.  Allein  die  umsichtige \r\nFrau,  mehr  aber  noch  der  ökonomische  Gemahl  lehnten \r\ndas  Geschäft  ab,  indem  sie  wohl  auf  Malereien  bedeu- \r\n\r\n\r\n58o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\ntende  Summen  verwendeten,  sich  aber  auf  Statuen  ein- \r\nzulassen keineswegs  den  Entschluß  fassen  könnten. \r\nNach  dieser  ablehnenden  Antwort  wurden  wir  nun  wieder \r\nzu  neuer  Überlegung  aufgeregt.  Die  Gunst  des  Glückes \r\nschien  ganz  eigen;  Meyer  betrachtete  den  Schatz  noch \r\neinmal  und  überzeugte  sich,  daß  das  Bildwerk  nach  seinen \r\nGesamtzeichen  wohl  als  griechische  Arbeit  anzuerkennen \r\nsei,  und  zwar  geraume  Zeit  vor  Augustus  hinauf,  vielleicht \r\nbis  an  Hiero  II.  geordnet  werden  könnte. \r\nDen  Kredit  hatte  ich  wohl,  dieses  bedeutende  Kunstwerk \r\nanzuschaffen,  Rega  schien  sogar  auf  Stückzahlung  ein- \r\ngehen zu  wollen,  und  es  war  ein  Augenblick,  wo  wir  uns \r\nschon  im  Besitz  des  Bildnisses  und  solches  in  unsemi  großen \r\nSaal  wohlbeleuchtet  aufgestellt  zu  sehen  glaubten. \r\nWie  aber  denn  doch  zwischen  einer  leidenschaftlichen \r\nLiebesneigung  und  einem  abzuschließenden  Heiratskon- \r\ntrakt noch  manche  Gedanken  sich  einzudringen  pflegen, \r\nso  war  es  auch  hier,  und  wir  durften  ohne  Rat  und  Zu- \r\nstimmung unsrer  edlen  Kunstverwandten,  des  Herrn  Zuc- \r\nchi  und  seiner  wohlmeinenden  Gattin,  eine  solche  Ver- \r\nbindung nicht  unternehmen:  denn  eine  Verbindung  war \r\nes  im  ideell-pygmalionischen  Sinne,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \r\ndaß  der  Gedanke,  dieses  Wesen  zu  besitzen,  bei  mir  tiefe \r\nWurzel  gefaßt  hatte.  Ja,  als  ein  Beweis,  wie  sehr  ich \r\nmir  hierin  schmeichelte,  mag  das  Bekenntnis  gelten,  daß \r\nich  dieses  Ereignis  als  einen  Wink  höherer  Dämonen  an- \r\nsah, die  mich  in  Rom  festzuhalten  und  alle  Gründe,  die \r\nmich  zum  Entschluß  der  Abreise  vermocht,  auf  das  tätigste \r\nniederzuschlagen  gedächten. \r\n\r\nGlücklicherweise  waren  wir  schon  in  den  Jahren,  wo  die \r\nVernunft  dem  Verstand  in  solchen  Fällen  zu  Hilfe  zu \r\nkommen  pflegt,  und  so  mußte  denn  Kunstneigung,  Be- \r\nsitzeslust, und  was  ihnen  sonst  beistand,  Dialektik  und \r\nAberglaube,  vor  den  guten  Gesinnungen  weichen,  welche \r\ndie  edle  Freundin  Angelica  mit  Sinn  und  Wohlwollen  an \r\nuns  zu  wenden  die  Geneigtheit  hatte.  Bei  ihren  Vor- \r\nstellungen traten  daher  aufs  klarste  die  sämtlichen  Schwie- \r\nrigkeiten und  Bedenklichkeiten  an  den  Tag,  die  sich  einem \r\nsolchen  Unternehmen  entsfeerenstellten.     Paihige,  bisher \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  581 \r\n\r\nden  Kunst-  und  Altertumsstudien  sich  widmende  Männer \r\ngriften  auf  einmal  in  den  Kunsthandel  ein  und  erregten \r\ndie  Eifersucht  der  zu  solchem  Geschäft  herkömmlich  Be- \r\nrechtigten. Die  Schwierigkeiten  der  Restauration  seien \r\nmannigfaltig,  und  es  frage  sich,  inwiefern  man  dabei  werde \r\nbillig  und  redlich  bedient  werden.  Wenn  ferner  bei  der \r\nAbsendung  auch  alles  in  möglichster  Ordnung  gehe,  so \r\nkönnten  doch  wegen  der  Erlaubnis  der  Ausfuhr  eines  sol- \r\nchen Kunstwerkes  am  Schluß  noch  Hindernisse  entstehen, \r\nund  was  alsdann  noch  wegen  der  Überfahrt  und  des  An- \r\nlandens  und  Ankommens  zu  Hause  alles  für  Widerwärtig- \r\nkeiten zu  befürchten  seien.  Über  solche  Betrachtungen, \r\nhieß  es,  gehe  der  Handelsmann  hinaus:  sowohl  Mühe  als \r\nGefahr  setze  sich  in  einem  großen  Ganzen  ins  Gleich- \r\ngewicht, dagegen  sei  ein  einzelnes  Unternehmen  dieser \r\nArt  auf  jede  Weise  bedenklich. \r\n\r\nDurch  solche  Vorstellungen  wurde  denn  nach  und  nach \r\nBegierde,  Wunsch  und  Vorsatz  gemildert,  geschwächt, \r\ndoch  niemals  ganz  ausgelöscht,  besonders  da  sie  endlich \r\nzu  großen  Ehren  gelangte:  denn  sie  steht  gegenwärtig  im \r\nMuseo  Pio-Clementino  in  einem  kleinen  angebauten, \r\naber  mit  dem  Museum  in  Verbindung  stehenden  Kabi- \r\nnett, wo  im  Fußboden  die  wunderschönen  Mosaiken  von \r\nMasken  und  Laubgewinden  eingesetzt  sind.  Die  übrige \r\nGesellschaft  von  Statuen  in  jenem  Kabinett  besteht:  i)  aus \r\nder  auf  der  Färse  sitzenden  Venus,  an  deren  Base  der \r\nName  des  Bupalus  eingegraben  steht;  2)  ein  sehr  schöner \r\nkleiner  Ganymedes;  3)  die  schöne  Statue  eines  Jünglings, \r\ndem,  ich  weiß  nicht  ob  mit  Recht,  der  Name  Adonis  bei- \r\ngelegt wird;  4)  ein  Faun  aus  Rosso  Antico;  5)  der  ruhig \r\nstehende  Diskobolus. \r\n\r\nVisconti  hat  im  dritten,  gedachtem  Museum  gewidmeten \r\nBande  dieses  Denkmal  beschrieben,  nach  seiner  Weise \r\nerklärt  und  auf  der  dreißigsten  Tafel  abbilden  lassen:  da \r\ndenn  jeder  Kunstfreund  mit  uns  bedauern  kann,  daß  es \r\nuns  nicht  gelungen,  sie  nach  Deutschland  zu  schaffen  und \r\nsie  irgend  einer  vaterländischen  großen  Sammlung  hin- \r\nzuzugesellen. \r\n\r\n\r\n582  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nMan  wird  es  natürlich  finden,  daß  ich  bei  meinen  Ab- \r\nschiedsbesuchen jene  anmutige  Mailänderin  nicht  ver- \r\ngaß. Ich  hatte  die  Zeit  her  von  ihr  manches  Vergnüg- \r\nliche gehört:  wie  sie  mit  Angelica  immer  vertrauter  ge- \r\nworden und  sich  in  der  höhern  Gesellschaft,  wohin  sie \r\ndadurch  gelangt,  gar  gut  zu  benehmen  wisse.  Auch  konnte \r\nich  die  Vermutung  nähren  und  den  Wunsch,  daß  ein  wohl- \r\nhabender junger  Mann,  welcher  mit  Zucchis  im  besten \r\nVernehmen  stand,  gegen  ihre  Anmut  nicht  unempfind- \r\nlich und  ernstere  Absichten  durchzuführen  nicht  abge- \r\nneigt sei. \r\n\r\nNun  fand  ich  sie  im  reinlichen  Morgenkleide,  wie  ich  sie \r\nzuerst  in  Castel  Gandolfo  gesehen;  sie  empfing  mich  mit \r\noffner  Anmut  und  drückte,  mit  natürlicher  Zierlichkeit, \r\nden  wiederholten  Dank  für  meine  Teilnahme  gar  liebens- \r\nwürdig aus.  \"Ich  werd  es  nie  vergessen,\"  sagte  sie,  \"daß \r\nich,  aus  Verwirrung  mich  wieder  erholend,  unter  den  an- \r\nfragenden geliebten  und  verehrten  Namen  auch  den  Eu- \r\nrigen  nennen  hörte;  ich  forschte  mehrmals,  ob  es  denn \r\nauch  wahr  sei.  Ihr  setztet  Eure  Erkundigungen  durcli \r\nmehrere  Wochen  fort,  bis  endlich  mein  Bruder,  Euch  be- \r\nsuchend, für  uns  beide  danken  konnte.  Ich  weiß  nicht, \r\nob  ers  ausgerichtet  hat,  wie  ichs  ihm  auftrug;  ich  wäre \r\ngern  mitgegangen,  wenn  sichs  geziemte.\"  Sie  fragte \r\nnach  dem  Weg,  den  ich  nehmen  wollte,  und  als  ich  ihr \r\nmeinen  Reiseplan  vorerzählte,  versetzte  sie:  \"Ihr  seid \r\nglücklich,  so  reich  zu  sein,  daß  Ihr  Euch  dies  nicht  zu \r\nversagen  braucht;  wir  andern  müssen  uns  in  die  Stelle \r\nfinden,  welche  Gott  und  seine  Heiligen  uns  angewiesen. \r\nSchon  lange  seh  ich  vor  meinem  Fenster  Schiffe  kommen \r\nund  abgehen,  ausladen  und  einladen;  das  ist  unterhal- \r\ntend, und  ich  denke  manchmal:  woher  und  wohin  das \r\nalles?\"  Die  Fenster  gingen  gerade  auf  die  Treppen  von \r\nRipetta,  die  Bewegung  war  eben  sehr  lebhaft. \r\nSie  sprach  von  ihrem  Bruder  mit  Zärtlichkeit,  freute  sich, \r\nseine  Haushaltung  ordentlich  zu  führen,  ihm  möglich  zu \r\nmachen,  daß  er,  bei  mäßiger  Besoldung,  noch  immer  et- \r\nwas zurück-,  in  einem  vorteilhaften  Handel  anlegen  könne; \r\ngenug,  sie  ließ  mich  zunächst  mit  ihren  Zuständen  durch- \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  583 \r\n\r\naus  vertraut  werden.  Ich  freute  mich  ihrer  Gesprächig- \r\nkeit: denn  eigenthch  macht  ich  eine  gar  wunderliche  Fi- \r\ns:ur,  indem  ich  schnell  alle  Momente  unsres  zarten  Ver- \r\nhältnisses,  vom  ersten  Augenblick  an  bis  zum  letzten,  mir \r\nwieder  vorzurollen  gedrängt  war.  Nun  trat  der  Bruder \r\nherein,  und  der  Abschied  schloß  sich  in  freundlicher  mä- \r\nßiger Prosa. \r\n\r\nAls  ich  vor  die  Türe  kam,  fand  ich  meinen  Wagen  ohne \r\nden  Kutscher,  den  ein  geschäftiger  Knabe  zu  holen  lief. \r\nSie  sah  heraus  zum  Fenster  des  Entresols,  den  sie  in \r\neinem  stattlichen  Gebäude  bewohnten;  es  war  nicht  gar \r\nhoch,  man  hätte  geglaubt,  sich  die  Hand  reichen  zu \r\nkönnen. \r\n\r\n\"Man  will  mich  nicht  von  Euch  wegführen,  seht  Ihr!\"  rief \r\nich  aus:  \"man  weiß,  so  scheint  es,  daß  ich  ungern  von \r\nEuch  scheide.\" \r\n\r\nWas  sie  darauf  erwiderte,  was  ich  versetzte,  den  Gang \r\ndes  anmutigsten  Gespräches,  das,  von  allen  Fesseln  frei, \r\ndas  Innere  zweier  sich  nur  halbbewußt  Liebenden  offen- \r\nbarte, will  ich  nicht  entweihen  durch  Wiederholung  und \r\nErzählung;  es  war  ein  wunderbares,  zufällig  eingeleitetes, \r\ndurch  innern  Drang  abgenötigtes  lakonisches  Schlußbe- \r\nkenntnis der  unschuldigsten  und  zartesten  wechselseitigen \r\nGewogenheit,  das  mir  auch  deshalb  nie  aus  Sinn  und \r\nSeele  gekommen  ist. \r\n\r\nAuf  eine  besonders  feierliche  Weise  sollte  jedoch  mein \r\nAbschied  aus  Rom  vorbereitet  werden:  drei  Nächte  vor- \r\nher stand  der  volle  Mond  am  klarsten  Himmel,  und  ein \r\nZauber,  der  sich  dadurch  über  die  ungeheure  Stadt  ver- \r\nbreitet, so  oft  empfunden,  ward  nun  aufs  eindringlichste \r\nfühlbar.  Die  großen  Lichtmassen,  klar,  wie  von  einem \r\nmilden  Tage  beleuchtet,  mit  ihren  Gegensätzen  von  tiefen \r\nSchatten,  durch  Reflexe  manchmal  erhellt,  zur  Ahnung \r\ndes  einzelnen,  setzen  uns  in  einen  Zustand  wie  von  einer \r\nandern,  einfachem,  großem  Welt. \r\n\r\nNach  zerstreuenden,  mitunter  peinlich  zugebrachten  Ta- \r\ngen macht  ich  den  Umgang  mit  wenigen  Freunden,  ein- \r\nmal ganz  allein.    Nachdem  ich  den  langen  Corso.  wohl \r\n\r\n\r\n5 84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  III \r\n\r\nzum  letztenmal,  durchwandert  hatte,  bestieg  ich  das  Ka- \r\npitel, das  wie  ein  Feenpalast  in  der  Wüste  dastand.  Die \r\nStatue  Marc  Aureis  rief  den  Kommandeur  in  Don  Juan \r\nzur  Erinnerung  und  gab  dem  Wanderer  zu  verstehen,  daß \r\ner  etwas  Ungewöhnliches  unternehme.  Dessen  ungeachtet \r\nging  ich  die  hintere  Treppe  hinab.  Ganz  finster,  finstern \r\nSchatten  werfend,  stand  mir  der  Triumphbogen  des  Sep- \r\ntimius  Severus  entgegen;  in  der  Einsamkeit  der  Via  Sa- \r\ncra erschienen  die  sonst  so  bekannten  Gegenstände  fremd- \r\nartig und  geisterhaft.  Als  ich  aber  den  erhabenen  Resten \r\ndes  Coliseo  mich  näherte  und  in  dessen  verschlossenes \r\nInnere  durchs  Gitter  hineinsah,  darf  ich  nicht  leugnen, \r\ndaß  mich  ein  Schauer  überfiel  und  meine  Rückkehr  be- \r\nschleunigte. \r\n\r\nAlles  Massenhafte  macht  einen  eignen  Eindruck,  zugleich \r\nals  erhaben  und  faßlich,  und  in  solchen  Umgängen  zog \r\nich  gleichsam  ein  unübersehbares  Summa  Summarum  mei- \r\nnes ganzen  Aufenthaltes.  Dieses,  in  aufgeregter  Seele \r\ntief  und  groß  empfunden,  erregte  eine  Stimmung,  die  ich \r\nheroisch- elegisch  nennen  darf,  woraus  sich  in  poetischer \r\nForm  eine  Elegie  zusammenbilden  wollte. \r\nUnd  wie  sollte  mir  gerade  in  solchen  Augenblicken  Ovids \r\nElegie  nicht  ins  Gedächtnis  zurückkehren,  der,  auch  ver- \r\nbannt, in  einer  Mondennacht  Rom  verlassen  sollte.  Cum \r\nrepeto  nocteml  seine  Rückerinnerung,  weit  hinten  am \r\nSchwarzen  Meere,  im  trauer-  und  jammervollen  Zustande, \r\nkam  mir  nicht  aus  dem  Sinn,  ich  wiederholte  das  Gedicht, \r\ndas  mir  teilweise  genau  im  Gedächtnis  hervorstieg,  aber \r\nmich  wirklich  an  eigner  Produktion  irre  werden  ließ  und \r\nhinderte;  die  auch,  später  unternommen,  niemals  zustande \r\nkommen  konnte. \r\n\r\n\r\nROM  1788  5S5 \r\n\r\n\r\nWandelt  von  jener  Nacht  mir  das  traurige  Bild  vor  die \r\n\r\nSeele, \r\nWelche  die  letzte  für  mich  ward  in  der  Römischen  Stadt, \r\nWiederhol  ich  die  Nacht,  wo  des  Teuren  so  viel  mir  zu- \r\nrückblieb, \r\nGleitet  vom  Auge  mir  noch  jetzt  eine  Träne  herab. \r\nUnd  schon  ruhten  bereits  die  Stimmen  der  Menschen  und \r\n\r\nHunde, \r\nLuna,  sie  lenkt  in  der  Höh  nächtliches  Rossegespann. \r\nZu  ihr  schaut  ich  hinan,  sah  dann  Kapitolische  Tempel, \r\nWelchen  umsonst  so  nah  unsere  Laren  afescrenzt. \r\n\r\n\r\nCum  subit  illius  tristissima  noctis  imago, \r\n\r\nQuae  mihi  supremum  tempus  in  Urbe  fuit, \r\nCum  repeto  noctem,  qua  tot  mihi  cara  reliqui, \r\n\r\nLabitur  ex  oculis  nunc  quoque  gutta  meis. \r\nJamque  quiescebant  voces  hominumque  canumque, \r\n\r\nLunaque  nocturnos  alta  regebat  equos. \r\nHanc  ego  suspiciens  et  ab  hac  Capitolia  cernens, \r\n\r\nQuae  nostro  frustra  juncta  fuere  Lari. \r\n\r\n\r\nINHALT \r\n\r\n\r\nERSTER  TEIL. \r\n\r\nKarlsbad  bis  auf  den  Brenner 1 1 \r\n\r\nVom  Brenner  bis  Verona     25 \r\n\r\nVerona  bis  Venedig 43 \r\n\r\nVenedig 67 \r\n\r\nFerrara  bis  Rom 104 \r\n\r\nRom 131 \r\n\r\nZWELLER  TEIL. \r\n\r\nNeapel 189 \r\n\r\nSizilien 237 \r\n\r\nNeapel 339 \r\n\r\nDRITTER  TEIL. \r\n\r\nZweiter  römischer  Aufenthalt.

      "content": "Den 3. Oktober. Die Kirche Il Redentore, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will. Er war unzufrieden, wie ich aus gelinder Wendung seines Buches schließe, daß man bei christlichen Kirchen nach der Form der alten Basiliken zu bauen fortfahre, er suchte deshalb seine heiligen Gebäude der alten Tempelform zu nähern; daher entstanden gewisse Unschicklichkeiten, die mir bei Il Redentore glücklich beseitigt, bei St. Giorgio aber zu auffallend erscheinen. Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf. Inwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren.   Den 3. Oktober. Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen. Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.   Den 3. Oktober. Den Plan in der Hand suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld. Es wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.",
