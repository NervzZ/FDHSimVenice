      "content": "\nSimulation Data Sheet: The Great Council of Venice (1740)\n\n\nDocument Objective\n\nThis document serves as a knowledge base for a text-based simulation (LLM). It details the mechanics, atmosphere, and procedures of the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council) in 1740, based on the institutional analysis of Amelot de La Houssaye and historical data regarding the daily life of the Republic.\n\n1. The Space: La Sala del Maggior Consiglio\n\nFor the simulation, the space acts as a constraining environment that dictates movement and social interaction.\n\nArchitecture and Symbolism\n\nDimensions: A massive hall (53m x 25m) free of supporting columns, capable of holding between 1,000 and 2,000 patricians.\nThe Ceiling: Heavy with gold leaf and paintings (notably Veronese’s The Triumph of Venice). It serves as a constant reminder of the divine and state hierarchy.\nThe East Wall (Il Paradiso): Dominated by Tintoretto’s immense canvas, located above the Signoria's tribune. By 1740, the painting had darkened with time, creating a severe backdrop behind the Doge.\nThe Tribune (La Signoria): A raised platform where the Doge, his six counselors, and the three chiefs of the Quarantia sit. They physically overlook the assembly.\nThe Benches (Banchi): Arranged in double rows parallel to the walls, leaving a vast central aisle empty for voting procedures.1\n\nAnnexed Spaces (Crucial for Intrigue)\n\nThe Liagò: A closed loggia or terrace adjacent to the hall. It is a \"decompression\" zone where nobles withdraw to speak freely, negotiate votes away from the Signoria’s gaze, or escape the stifling air of the main hall.2\nThe Sala dello Scrutinio: An adjacent hall often used for counting votes or secondary balloting procedures.3\n\nSensory Atmosphere\n\nAcoustics: The sheer volume of the hall and the number of participants create a constant background hum (buzzing). Official readings by the Chancellor are often inaudible to those seated at the far ends.\nLight and Temperature: The hall is lit by large windows facing the lagoon. In winter, it is notoriously freezing (nobles keep their fur-lined cloaks on). In summer, the heat and the proximity of bodies make the air oppressive.4\n\n2. The Actors: Patrician Sociology (1740)\n\nThe simulation must distinguish between three classes of nobles, who are legally equal but economically and politically divided.\n\nThe Three Classes\n\nThe \"Case Vecchie\" and the Rich: Historic families or immense new fortunes. They monopolize high executive offices (Savi, Council of Ten, Ambassadors). They use the Great Council to validate their power, though real decisions are made in the Senate.5\nThe Middle Nobility: They aim for judicial (Quarantie) and administrative offices. They are often legalistic and attached to procedure.\nThe Barnabotti (The Noble Plebs):\nDefinition: Impoverished nobles, often living in the parish of San Barnaba. They have lost their fortunes but retain their vote in the Council.6\nRole in Simulation: They constitute an electoral maneuver mass. Barred from trade and manual labor, their only \"commodity\" is their vote. They are known to be unruly and to sell their suffrage in exchange for informal gratuities (protection, loans, meals).7\n\nCostume (Visual Code)\n\nThe Vesta (Toga): Mandatory for all. A long black gown with large sleeves (a comito). In winter, it is lined with fur; in summer, it is made of light silk.9\nThe Stola (Stole): A band of black cloth worn over the left shoulder. Its width and lining indicate rank (ordinary for a simple noble, wide and fur-lined for Senators and Councilors).10\nThe Wig: By 1740, the use of the powdered wig is generalized, creating an anachronistic contrast between the medieval costume (toga) and the Rococo hairstyle. High, voluminous wigs are a sign of fashion and wealth.\n\n3. The Political Ritual\n\n\nBefore the Session: The Broglio\n\nLocation: The Piazzetta San Marco, before the bell rings.\nAction: This is the time for electoral solicitation. Candidates (\"solicitors\") stand on one side, electors on the other.12\nGestures: Open campaigning is forbidden by law. Everything occurs through codes of exaggerated politeness: deep bows, kissing of the sleeve or stole, and whispered requests for support (\"Mi raccomando\").12\nThe Trottiera: The specific bell that announces the imminent start of the session, urging latecomers to hasten to the palace.4\n\nDuring the Session: Voting and Chance\n\nThe Venetian system, detailed by Amelot de La Houssaye, relies on a complex mix of Sortition (to prevent factions) and Election (to ensure competence).\n\nThe Tools\n\nThe Ballottino: A boy aged 8 to 10, often dressed in white, tasked with drawing balls from the urns to guarantee the innocence of chance.3\nThe Bussole (Urns): Wooden structures allowing for secret voting. The noble inserts his hand and drops his ball into a hidden tube (the \"Yes\" tube or \"No\" tube).\nThe Balls (Balote): Small balls made of compressed linen (for silence).\nGold: Winning ball (for sortition).\nSilver: Losing ball.\nWhite / Red (or Green): Used for voting \"Yes\" or \"No\" during legislative or judicial scrutinies.3\n\nThe \"Four Hands\" Procedure (Election of Magistrates)\n\nThis is the standard procedure for electing state officials.14\nThe Sortition: Each noble passes before an urn. The Ballottino draws a ball for him. If he gets a Gold ball, he becomes an Elector. This continues until 36 electors are chosen.14\nThe Division: The 36 electors are isolated and divided into 4 groups of 9, called \"Hands\" (Mani).\nThe Nomination (Secret): Each \"Hand,\" isolated in a separate room, must agree (by a majority of 6 out of 9) to propose one candidate for the vacant post.\nThe General Ballot: The 4 names proposed (one by each \"Hand\") are announced to the Great Council. The entire assembly then votes for or against each candidate. The one with the most votes wins.14\n\n4. Simulation Data Cards\n\n\nCard A: Sequence of Actions (Sunday Routine)\n\n10:00 AM - Broglio: Social interaction on the Piazza. Informal negotiations.\n10:30 AM - Trottiera: Sound signal. Crowd movement towards the Giants' Staircase.\n11:00 AM - Installation: Entry into the hall. Barnabotti seek strategic seats or cluster together.\n11:30 AM - Reading: The Chancellor reads the list of vacant posts. Ambient hubbub.\n12:00 PM - Lottery (Ballottino): Slow procession before the urn. Tension of the Gold/Silver draw.\n1:00 PM - Conclave of the 4 Hands: Session suspension for the 36 electors. Others wait, chat in the Liagò.\n2:00 PM - Final Vote: Procession to the Bussole to validate candidates.\n\nCard B: Tension Variables\n\nThese modifiers can be used to generate incidents or intrigues in the simulation.\nCold/Heat: Impatience factor. Can push nobles to rush a vote or leave the session early (if the quorum is not threatened).\nVote Selling: A player may be approached by an agent of a rich family: \"A dinner invitation in exchange for a white ball for candidate Cornaro.\"6\nProcedural Error: If the Ballottino makes a mistake or an urn is improperly closed, the Quarantie (judges) must intervene, creating a dramatic interruption.\n\n5.

Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

September  1786. \n\nDAS  Amphitheater  ist  also  das  erste  bedeutende  Monu- \nment der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  sehe,  tmd  so  gut  erhalten! \nAls  ich  hinein  trat,  mehr  noch  aber,  als  ich  oben  auf  dem \nRande  umher  ging,  schien  es  mir  seltsam,  etwas  Großes \nund  doch  eigentlich  nichts  zu  sehen.  Auch  will  es  leer \nnicht  gesehen  sein,  sondern  ganz  voll  von  Menschen,  wie \nman  es  neuerer  Zeit  Joseph  dem  Zweiten  und  Pius  dem \nSechsten  zu  Ehren  veranstaltet.  Der  Kaiser,  der  doch \nauch  Menschenmassen  vor  Augen  gewohnt  war,  soll  dar- \nüber erstaunt  sein.  Doch  nur  in  der  frühesten  Zeit  tat \nes  seine  ganze  Wirkung,  da  das  Volk  noch  mehr  Volk \nwar,  als  es  jetzt  ist.  Denn  eigentlich  ist  so  ein  Amphi- \ntheater recht  gemacht,  dem  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zu  impo- \nnieren, das  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zum  besten  zu  haben. \nWenn  irgend  etwas  Schauwürdiges  auf  flacher  Erde  vor- \ngeht und  alles  zuläuft,  suchen  die  Hintersten  auf  alle \nmögliche  Weise  sich  über  die  Vordersten  zu  erheben:  man \ntritt  auf  Bänke,  rollt  Fässer  herbei,  fährt  mit  Wagen \nheran,  legt  Bretter  hinüber  und  herüber,  besetzt  einen \nbenachbarten  Hügel,  und  es  bildet  sich  in  der  Geschwin- \ndigkeit ein  Krater. \n\nKommt  das  Schauspiel  öfter  auf  derselben  Stelle  vor,  so \nbaut  man  leichte  Gerüste  für  die,  so  bezahlen  können, \nund  die  übrige  Masse  behilft  sich,  wie  sie  mag.  Dieses \nallgemeine  Bedürfnis  zu  befriedigen,  ist  hier  die  Aufgabe \ndes  Architekten.  Er  bereitet  einen  solchen  Krater  durch \nKunst,  so  einfach  als  nur  möglich,  damit  dessen  Zierat \ndas  Volk  selbst  werde.  Wenn  es  sich  so  beisammen  sah, \nmußte  es  über  sich  selbst  erstaunen;  denn  da  es  sonst \nnur  gewohnt,  sich  durcheinander  laufen  zu  sehen,  sich  in \neinem  Gewühle  ohne  Ordnung  und  sonderliche  Zucht  zu \nfinden,  so  sieht  das  vielköpfige,  vielsinnige,  schwankende, \nhin  und  her  irrende  Tier  sich  zu  einem  edlen  Körper \nvereinigt,  zu  einer  Einheit  bestimmt,  in  eine  Masse \nverbunden  und  befestigt,  als  eine  Gestalt,  von  eijiem \nGeiste  belebt.    Die  Simplizität  des  Oval  ist  jedem  Auge \n\n\n44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  die  angenehmste  Weise  fühlbar,  und  jeder  Kopf  dient \nzum  Maße,  wie  ungeheuer  das  Ganze  sei.  Jetzt,  wenn \nman  es  leer  sieht,  hat  man  keinen  Maßstab,  man  weiß \nnicht,  ob  es  groß  oder  klein  ist. \n\nWegen  der  Unterhaltung  dieses  Werks  müssen  die  Vero- \nneser  gelobt  werden.  Es  ist  von  einem  rötlichen  Marmor \ngebaut,  den  die  Witterung  angreift;  daher  stellt  man  der \nReihe  nach  die  ausgefressenen  Stufen  immer  wieder  her, \nund  sie  scheinen  fast  alle  ganz  neu.  Eine  Inschrift  ge- \ndenkt eines  Hieronymus  Maurigenus  und  seines  auf  dieses \nMonument  verwendeten  unglaublichen  Fleißes.  Von  der \näußern  Mauer  steht  nur  ein  Stück,  und  ich  zweifele,  ob \nsie  je  ganz  fertig  geworden.  Die  untern  Gewölbe,  die  an \nden  großen  Platz,  II  Brä  genannt,  stoßen,  sind  an  Hand- \nwerker vermietet,  und  es  sieht  lustig  genug  aus,  diese \nHöhlungen  wieder  belebt  zu  sehen. \n\nDas  schönste,  aber  immer  geschlossene  Tor  heißt  Porta \nstuppa  oder  del  Pallio.  Als  Tor  und  in  der  großen  Ent- \nfernung, aus  der  man  es  schon  gewahr  wird,  ist  es  nicht \ngut  gedacht;  denn  erst  in  der  Nähe  erkennt  man  das \nVerdienst  des  Gebäudes. \n\nSie  geben  allerlei  Ursachen  an,  warum  es  geschlossen \nsei.  Ich  habe  jedoch  eine  Mutmaßung.  Die  Absicht  des \nKünstlers  ging  offenbar  dahin,  durch  dieses  Tor  eine  neue \nAnlage  des  Korso  zu  verursachen;  denn  auf  die  jetzige \nStraße  steht  es  ganz  falsch.  Die  linke  Seite  hat  lauter \nBaracken,  und  die  winkelrechte  Linie  der  Mitte  des  Tores \ngeht  auf  ein  Nonnenkloster  zu,  das  notwendig  hätte \nniedergelegt  werden  müssen.  Das  sah  man  wohl  ein,  auch \nmochten  die  Vornehmen  und  Reichen  nicht  Lust  haben, \nsich  in  dem  entfernten  Quartier  anzubauen.  Der  Künstler \nstarb  vielleicht,  und  so  schloß  man  das  Tor,  wodurch  die \nSache  nun  auf  einmal  geendigt  war. \n\nDas  Portal  des  Theatergebäudes,  von  sechs  großen  ioni- \nschen Säulen,  nimmt  sich  anständig  genug  aus.  Desto \nkleinlicher  erscheint  über  der  Türe,  vor  einer  gemalten \nNische,  die  von  zwei  korintliischen  Säulen  getragen  wird \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  45 \n\ndie  lebensgroße  Büste  des  Marchese  Maffei  in  einer \ngroßen  Perücke.  Der  Platz  ist  ehrenvoll,  aber  um  sich \ngegen  die  Größe  und  Tüchtigkeit  der  Säulen  einiger- \nmaßen zu  halten,  hätte  die  Büste  kolossal  sein  müssen. \nJetzt  steht  sie  kleinlich  auf  einem  Kragsteinchen,  unhar- \nmonisch mit  dem  Ganzen. \n\nAuch  die  Galerie,  die  den  Vorhof  einfaßt,  ist  kleinlich, \nund  die  kannelierten  dorischen  Zwerge  nehmen  sich  neben \nden  glatten  ionischen  Riesen  armselig  aus.  Doch  wollen \nwir  das  verzeihen  in  Betracht  der  schönen  Anstalt,  welche \nunter  diesen  Säulenlauben  angelegt  ist.  Hier  hat  man \ndie  Antiquitäten,  meist  in  und  um  Verona  gegraben,  ge- \nsammelt aufgestellt.  Einiges  soll  sogar  sich  im  Amphi- \ntheater gefunden  haben.  Es  sind  etrurische,  griechische, \nrömische,  bis  zu  den  niedern  Zeiten  und  auch  neuere. \nDie  Basreliefs  sind  in  die  Wände  eingemauert  und  mit \nden  Nummern  versehen,  die  ihnen  Maffei  gab,  als  er  sie \nin  seinem  Werke  Verona  illustrata  beschrieb.  Altäre, \nStücke  von  Säulen  und  dergleichen  Reste.  Ein  ganz  treff- \nlicher Dreifuß  von  weißem  Marmor,  worauf  Genien,  die \nsich  mit  den  Attributen  der  Götter  beschäftigen.  Raffael \nhat  dergleichen  in  den  Zwickeln  der  Farnesine  nachge- \nahmt und  verklärt. \n\nDer  Wind,  der  von  den  Gräbern  der  Alten  herweht, \nkommt  mit  Wohlgerüchen  wie  über  einen  Rosenhügel. \nDie  Grabmäler  sind  herzlich  und  rührend  und  stellen \nimmer  das  Leben  her.  Da  ist  ein  Mann,  der  neben  seiner \nFrau  aus  einer  Nische  wie  zu  einem  Fenster  heraussieht. \nDa  stehen  Vater  und  Mutter,  den  Sohn  in  der  Mitte,  ein- \nander mit  unaussprechlicher  Natürlichkeit  anblickend. \nHier  reicht  sich  ein  Paar  die  Hände.  Hier  scheint  ein \nVater,  auf  seinem  Sofa  ruhend,  von  der  Familie  unter- \nhalten zu  werden.  Mir  war  die  unmittelbare  Gegenwart \ndieser  Steine  höchst  rührend.  Von  späterer  Kunst  sind \nsie,  aber  einfach,  natürlich  und  allgemein  ansprechend. \nHier  ist  kein  geharnischter  Mann  auf  den  Knien,  der \neine  fröhliche  Auferstehung  erwartet.  Der  Künstler  hat \nmit  mehr  oder  weniger  Geschick  nur  die  einfache  Gegen- \nwart  der   Menschen  hingestellt,   ihre  Existenz  dadurch \n\n\n46  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfortgesetzt  und  bleibend  gemacht.  Sie  falten  nicht  die \nHände,  schauen  nicht  gen  Himmel,  sondern  sie  sind  hie- \nnieden,  was  sie  waren  und  was  sie  sind.  Sie  stehen  bei- \nsammen, nehmen  Anteil  aneinander,  lieben  sich;  und  das \nist  in  den  Steinen,  sogar  mit  einer  gewissen  Handwerks- \nunfähigkeit, allerliebst  ausgedrückt.  Ein  sehr  reich  ver- \nzierter marmorner  Pfeiler  gab  mir  auch  neue  Begriffe. \nSo  löblich  diese  Anstalt  ist,  so  sieht  man  ihr  doch  an, \ndaß  der  edle  Erhaltungsgeist,  der  sie  gegründet,  nicht \nmehr  in  ihr  fortlebt.  Der  kostbare  Dreifuß  geht  nächstens \nzugrunde,  weil  er  frei  steht,  gegen  Westen  der  Witterung \nausgesetzt.  Mit  einem  hölzernen  Futteral  wäre  dieser \nSchatz  leicht  zu  erhalten. \n\nDer  angefangene  Palast  des  Proveditore,  wäre  er  fertig \ngeworden,  hätte  ein  schön  Stück  Baukunst  gegeben.  Sonst \nbauen  die  Nobili  noch  viel,  leider  aber  ein  jeder  auf  den \nPlatz,  wo  seine  ältere  Wohnung  stand,  also  oft  in  engen \nGassen.  So  baut  man  jetzt  eine  prächtige  Fassade  eines \nSeminariums  in  einem  Gäßchen  der  entferntesten  Vor- \nstadt. \n\nAls  ich  mit  meinem  zufällig  aufgegriffenen  Begleiter  vor \neinem  großen  ernsthaften  Tore  eines  wunderbaren  Ge- \nbäudes vorüberging,  fragte  er  mich  gutmütig,  ob  ich  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  in  den  Hof  treten  wolle.  Es  war  der \nPalast  der  Justiz,  und  wegen  Höhe  der  Gebäude  erschien \nder  Hof  doch  nur  als  ein  ungeheurer  Brunnen.  Hier \nwerden,  sagte  er,  alle  die  Verbrecher  und  Verdächtigen \nverwahrt.  Ich  sah  umher,  und  durch  alle  Stockwerke \ngingen,  an  zahlreichen  Türen  hin,  offene  mit  eisernen \nGeländern  versehene  Gänge.  Der  Gefangene,  wie  er  aus \nseinem  Kerker  heraustrat,  um  zum  Verhör  geführt  zu \nwerden,  stand  in  der  freien  Tuft,  war  aber  auch  den \nBlicken  aller  ausgesetzt;  und  weil  nun  mehrere  Verhör- \nstuben sein  mochten,  so  klapperten  die  Ketten  bald  über \ndiesem,  bald  über  jenem  Gange  durch  alle  Stockwerke. \nEs  war  ein  verwünschter  Anblick,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \ndaß  der  gute  Humor,  womit  ich  meine  Vögel  abgefertigt \nhatte,  hier  doch  einen  etwas  schweren  Stand  würde  ge- \nfunden haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  47 \n\nIch  ging  auf  der  Kante  des  amphitheatralischen  Kraters \nbei  Sonnenuntergang,  der  schönsten  Aussicht  genießend \nüber  Stadt  und  Gegend.  Ich  war  ganz  allein,  und  unten \nauf  den  breiten  Steinen  des  Brä  gingen  Mengen  von \nMenschen,  Männer  von  allen  Ständen,  Weiber  vomMittel- \nstande  spazieren.  Diese  letztern  nehmen  sich  in  ihren \nschwarzen  Überkleidern,  aus  dieser  Vogelperspektive,  gar \nmumienhaft  aus. \n\nDer  Zendale  und  die  Veste,  die  dieser  Klasse  statt  aller \nGarderobe  dient,  ist  übrigens  eine  Tracht,  ganz  einge- \nrichtet für  ein  Volk,  das  nicht  immer  für  Reinlichkeit \nsorgen  und  doch  immer  ööentlich  erscheinen,  bald  in  der \nKirche,  bald  auf  dem  Spaziergange  sein  will.  Veste  ist \nein  schwarztaffeter  Rock,  der  über  andere  Röcke  gewor- \nfen wird.  Hat  das  Frauenzimmer  einen  reinlichen  weißen \ndarunter,  so  versteht  sie  den  schwarzen  an  der  einen  Seite \nin  die  Höhe  zu  heben.  Dieser  wird  so  angegürtet,  daß \ner  die  Taille  abschneidet  und  die  Lippen  des  Korsetts \nbedeckt,  welches  von  jeglicher  Farbe  sein  kann.  Der \nZendale  ist  eine  große  Kappe,  mit  langen  Barten,  die \nKappe  selbst  durch  ein  Drahtgestell  hoch  über  den  Kopf \ngehalten,  die  Barte  aber  wie  eine  Schärpe  um  den  Leib \ngeknüpft,  so  daß  die  Enden  hinterwärts  herunterfallen. \n\nAls  ich  heute  wieder  von  der  Arena  wegging,  kam  ich \neinige  tausend  Schritte  davon  zu  einem  modernen  ößent- \nlichen  Schauspiel.  Vier  edle  Veroneser  schlugen  Ball \ngegen  vier  Vicentiner.  Sie  treiben  dies  sonst  unter  sich \ndas  ganze  Jahr,  etwa  zwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht;  diesmal, \nwegen  der  fremden  Gegner,  lief  das  Volk  unglaublich  zu. \nEs  können  immer  vier-  bis  fünftausend  Zuschauer  ge- \nwesen sein.  Frauen  sah  ich  von  keinem  Stande. \nVorhin,  als  ich  vom  Bedürfnis  der  Menge  in  einem  sol- \nchen Falle  sprach,  hab'  ich  das  natürliche  zufällige  Am- \nphitaeater  schon  beschrieben,  wie  ich  das  Volk  hier  über- \neinander gebaut  sah.  Ein  lebhaftes  Händeklatschen  hört' \nich  schon  von  weiten,  jeder  bedeutende  Schlag  war  da- \nvon begleitet.  Das  Spiel  aber  geht  so  vor  sich:  In  ge- \nhöriger Entfernung  voneinander   sind   zwei   gelind  ab- \n\n\n4  3  ITA  1  JENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nliängige  Bretterflächen  errichtet.  Derjenige,  der  den  Ball \nausschlägt,  steht,  die  Rechte  mit  einem  hölzernen  breiten \nStachelringe  bewaffnet,  auf  der  obersten  Höhe.  Ir^dem \nnun  ein  anderer  von  seiner  Partei  ihm  den  r>all  zuwirft, \nso  läuft  er  herunter  dem  Ball  entgegen  und  vermehrt  da- \ndurch die  Gewalt  des  Schlages,  womit  er  denselben  zu \ntreffen  weiß.  Die  Gegner  suchen  ihn  zurückzuschlagen, \nund  so  geht  es  hin  und  wieder,  bis  er  zuletzt  im  Felde \nliegen  bleibt.  Die  schönsten  Stellungen,  wert,  in  Marmor \nnachgebildet  zu  werden,  kommen  dabei  zum  Vorschein. \nDa  es  lauter  wohlgewachsene,  rüstige,  junge  Leute  sind, \nin  kurzer,  knapper,  weißer  Kleidung,  so  unterscheiden \nsich  die  Parteien  nur  durch  ein  farbiges  Abzeichen.  Be- \nsonders schön  ist  die  Stellung,  in  welche  der  Ausschlagende \ngerät,  indem  er  von  der  schiefen  Fläche  herunter  läuft \nund  den  Ball  zu  treffen  ausholt;  sie  nähert  sich  der  des \nBorghesischen  Fechters. \n\nSonderbar  kam  es  mir  vor,  daß  sie  diese  Übung  an  einer \nnlten  Stadtmauer,  ohne  die  mindeste  Bequemlichkeit  für \ndie  Zuschauer,  vornehmen;  warum  sie  es  nicht  im  Amphi- \ntheater tun,  wo  so  schöner  Raum  wäre! \n\nDen  //.  September. \nWas  ich  von  Gemälden  gesehen,  will  ich  nur  kurz  be- \nrühren und  einige  Betrachtungen  hinzufügen.  Ich  mache \ndiese  wunderbare  Reise  nicht,  um  micli  selbst  zu  be- \ntrügen, sondern  um  mich  an  den  Gegenständen  kennen \nzu  lernen;  da  sage  ich  mir  denn  ganz  aufrichtig,  daß  ich \nvon  der  Kunst,  von  dem  Handwerk  des  Malers  wenig \nverstehe.  Meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  meine  Betrachtung \nkann  nur  auf  den  jiraktischen  Teil,  auf  den  Gegenstand \nund  auf  die  Behandlung  desselben  im  allgemeinen  ge- \nrichtet sein. \n\nSan  Giorgio  ist  eine  Galerie  von  guten  Gemälden,  alle \nAltarblätter,  wo  nicht  von  gleichem  Wert,  doch  duich- \naus  merkwürdig.  Aber  die  unglückseigen  Künstler,  was \nmußten  die  malen!  und  für  wen!  Ein  Mannaregen,  viel- \nleicht dreißig  Fuß  lang  und  zwanzig  hoch!  das  Wunder \nder  fünf  Brote  zum  Gegenstück!  was  war  daran  zu  malen: \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  49 \n\nHungrige  Menschen,  die  über  kleine  Körner  herfallen, \nunzählige  andere,  denen  Brot  präsentiert  wird.  Die \nKünstler  haben  sich  die  Folter  gegeben,  um  solche  Arm- \nseligkeiten bedeutend  zu  machen.  Und  doch  hat,  durch \ndiese  Nötigung  gereizt,  das  Genie  schöne  Sachen  hervor- \ngebracht. Ein  Künstler,  der  die  heilige  Ursula  mit  den \neilftausend  Jungfrauen  vorzustellen  hatte,  zog  sich  mit \ngroßem  Verstand  aus  der  Sache.  Die  Heilige  steht  im \nVordergrunde,  als  habe  sie  siegend  das  Land  in  Besitz \ngenommen;  sie  ist  sehr  edel,  amazonenhaft-jungfräulich, \nohne  Reiz  gebildet;  in  der  alles  verkleinernden  Ferne \nhingegen  sieht  man  ihre  Schar  aus  den  Schiften  steigen \nund  ia  Prozession  herankommen.  Die  Himmelfahrt  Maria \nim  Dom,  von  Tizian,  ist  sehr  verschwärzt,  der  Gedanke \nlobenswert,  daß  die  angehende  Göttin  nicht  himmel- \nwärts, sondern  herab  nach  ihren  Freunden  blickt. \nIn  der  Galerie  Gherardini  fand  ich  sehr  schöne  Sachen \nvon  Orbetto  und  lernte  diesen  verdienten  Künstler  auf \neinmal  kennen.  In  der  Entfernung  erfährt  man  nur  von \nden  ersten  Künstlern,  und  oft  begnügt  man  sich  mit  ihren \nNamen;  wenn  man  aber  diesem  Sternenhimmel  näher \ntritt  und  die  von  der  zweiten  und  dritten  Größe  nun  auch \nzu  flimmern  anfangen  und  jeder  auch  als  zum  ganzen \nSternbild  gehörend  hervortritt,  dann  wird  die  Welt  weit \nund  die  Kunst  reich.  Den  Gedanken  eines  Bildes  muß \nich  hier  loben.  Nur  zwei  Halbfiguren.  Simson  ist  eben \nim  Schöße  der  Delila  eingeschlafen,  sie  greift  leise  über \nihn  hinweg  nach  einer  Schere,  die  auf  dem  Tisch  neben \nder  Lampe  liegt.  Die  Ausfülirung  ist  sehr  brav.  Im \nPalast  Canossa  war  mir  eine  Danae  bemerklich. \nDer  Palast  Bevilacqua  enthält  die  köstlichsten  Sachen. \nEin  sogenanntes  Paradies  von  Tintorett,  eigentlich  aber \ndie  Krönung  der  Maria  zur  Himmelskönigin  in  Gegen- \nwart aller  Erzväter,  Propheten,  Apostel,  Heiligen,  Engel \nusw.,  eine  Gelegenheit,  den  ganzen  Reichtum  des  glück- \nlichsten Genies  zu  entwickeln.  Leichtigkeit  des  Pinsels, \nGeist,  Mannigfaltigkeit  des  Ausdrucks,  dies  alles  zu  be- \nwundern und  sich  dessen  zu  erfreuen,  müßte  man  das \nStück  selbst  besitzen  und  es  zeitlebens  vor  Augen  haben. \n\nGOETHE  IV  4 \n\n\n50  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  Arbeit  geht  ins  Unendliche,  ja  die  letzten  in  der \nGlorie  verschwindenden  Engelsköpfe  haben  noch  Cha- \nrakter. Die  größten  Figuren  mögen  einen  Fuß  hoch  sein, \nMaria  und  Christus,  der  ihr  die  Krone  aufsetzt,  etwa \nvier  Zoll.  Die  Eva  ist  doch  das  schönste  Weibchen  auf \ndem  Bilde  und  noch  immer  von  alters  her  ein  wenig \nlüstern. \n\nEin  paar  Porträte  von  Paul  Veronese  haben  meine  Hoch- \nachtung für  diesen  Künstler  nur  vermehrt.  Die  Antiken- \nsammlung ist  herrlich,  ein  hingestreckter  Sohn  der  Niobe \nköstlich,  die  Büsten,  ungeachtet  ihrer  restaurierten  Nasen, \nmeistens  höchst  interessant,  ein  August  mit  der  Bürger- \nkrone, ein  Caligula  und  andere. \n\nJ'ls  liegt  in  meiner  Natur,  das  Große  und  Schöne  willig \nund  mit  Freuden  zu  verehren,  und  diese  Anlage  an  so \nlaerrlichen  Gegenständen  Tag  für  Tag,  Stunde  für  Stunde \nauszubilden,  ist  das  seligste  aller  Gefühle. \nIn  einem  Lande,  wo  man  des  Tages  genießt,  besonders \naber  des  Abends  sich  erfreut,  ist  es  höchst  bedeutend, \nwenn  die  Nacht  einbricht.  Dann  hört  die  Arbeit  auf, \ndann  kehrt  der  Spaziergänger  zurück,  der  Vater  will  seine \nTochter  wieder  zu  Hause  sehen,  der  Tag  hat  ein  Ende; \ndoch  was  Tag  sei,  wissen  wir  Cimmerier  kaum.  In  ewi- \ngem Nebel  und  Trübe  ist  es  uns  einerlei,  ob  es  Tag  oder \nNacht  ist;  denn  wie  viel  Zeit  können  wir  uns  unter  freiem \nHimmel  wahrhaft  ergehen  und  ergötzen:  Wie  hier  die \nNacht  eintritt,  ist  der  Tag  entschieden  vorbei,  der  aus \nAbend  und  Morgen  bestand;  vierundzwanzig  Stunden  sind \nverlebt,  eine  neue  Rechnung  geht  an,  die  Glocken  läuten, \nder  Rosenkranz  wird  gebetet,  mit  brennender  Lampe  tritt \ndie  Magd  in  das  Zimmer  und  spricht:  Felicissima  nottc! \nDiese  Epoche  verändert  sich  mit  jeder  Jahreszeit,  und  der \nMensch,  der  hier  lebendig  lebt,  kann  nicht  irre  werden, \nweil  jeder  Genuß  seines  Daseins  sich  nicht  auf  die  Stunde, \nsondern  auf  die  Tageszeit  bezieht.  Zwänge  man  dem \nVolke  einen  deutschen  Zeiger  auf,  so  würde  man  es  ver- \nwirrt machen,  denn  der  seinige  ist  innigst  mit  seiner \nNatur  verwebt.  Anderthalb  Stunden,  eine  Stunde  vor \nNacht  fängt  der  Adel  an,  au.szufahren;   es  geht  auf  den \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  51 \n\nBrä,  die  lange  breite  Straße  nach  der  Porta  nuova  zu,  das \nTor  hinaus,  an  der  Stadt  hin,  und  wie  es  Nacht  schlägt, \nkehrt  alles  um.  Teils  fahren  sie  an  die  Kirchen,  das \nAve  Maria  della  sera  zu  beten,  teils  halten  sie  auf  dem \nBrä;  die  Kavaliers  treten  an  die  Kutschen,  unterhalten \nsich  mit  den  Damen,  und  das  dauert  eine  Weile,  ich  habe \ndas  Ende  niemals  abgewartet;  die  Fußgänger  bleiben \nweit  in  die  Nacht.  Heute  war  gerade  so  viel  Regen  nie- \ndergegangen, um  den  Staub  zu  löschen;  es  war  wirklich \nein  lebendiger,  munterer  Anblick. \n\nUm  mich  ferner  in  einem  wichtigen  Punkte  der  Landes- \ngewohnheit gleichzustellen,  habe  ich  mir  ein  Hilfsmittel \nerdacht,  wie  ich  ihre  Stundenrechnung  mir  leichter  zu \neigen  machte.  Nachfolgendes  Bild  kann  davon  einen  Be- \ngriff geben.  Der  innere  Kreis  bedeutet  unsere  vierund- \nzwanzig Stunden,  von  Mitternacht  zu  Mitternacht,  in \nzweimal  zwölf  geteilt,  wie  wir  zählen  und  unsere  Uhren \nsie  zeigen.  Der  mittlere  Kreis  deutet  an,  wie  die  Glocken \nin  der  jetzigen  Jahreszeit  hier  schlagen,  nämlich  gleich- \nfalls zweimal  bis  zwölf  in  vierundzwanzig  Stunden,  allein \ndergestalt,  daß  es  eins  schlägt,  wenn  es  bei  uns  acht \nschlüge,  und  so  fort,  bis  zwölfe  voll  sind.  Morgens  acht \nUhr  nach  unserm  Zeiger  schlägt  es  wieder  eins  usw.  Der \noberste  Kreis  zeigt  nun  endlich,  wie  bis  vierundzwanzig \nim  Leben  gezählt  wird.  Ich  höre  z.  B.  in  der  Nacht  sie- \nben schlagen  und  weiß,  daß  Mitternacht  um  fünf  ist,  so \nziehe  ich  diese  Zahl  von  jener  ab  und  habe  also  zwei \nUhr  Nachmitternacht.  Hör  ich  am  Tage  sieben  schlagen \nund  weiß,  daß  auch  Mittag  um  fünf  Uhr  ist,  so  verfahre \nich  ebenso  und  habe  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag.  Will  ich \naber  die  Stunden  nach  hiesiger  Weise  aussprechen,  so \nmuß  ich  wissen,  daß  Mittag  siebenzehn  Uhr  ist;  hiezu \nfüge  ich  noch  die  zwei  und  sage  neunzehn  Uhr.  Wenn \nman  dies  zum  erstenmal  hört  und  überdenkt,  so  scheint \nes  höchst  verworren  und  schwer  durchzuführen;  man  wird \nes  aber  gar  bald  gewohnt  und  findet  diese  Beschäftigung \nunterhaltend,  wie  sich  auch  das  Volk  an  dem  ewigen \nHin-  und  Widerrechnen  ergötzt,  wie  Kinder  an  leicht  zu \nüberwindenden    Schwierig-keiten.     Sie    haben    ohnedies \n\n\n52  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nimmer  die  Finger  in  der  Luft,  rechnen  alles  im  Kopfe \nund  machen  sich  gern  mit  Zahlen  zu  schaffen.  Ferner  ist \ndem  Inländer  die  Sache  so  viel  leichter,  weil  er  sich  um \nMittag  und  Mitternacht  eigentlich  nicht  bekümmert  und \nnicht,  wie  der  Fremde  in  diesem  Lande  tut,  zwei  Zeiger \nmiteinander  vergleicht.  Sie  zählen  nur  von  Abend  die \nStunden,  wie  sie  schlagen;  am  Tag  addieren  sie  die  Zahl \nzu  der  ihnen  bekannten  abwechselnden  Mittagszahl.  Das \nweitere  erläutern  die  der  Figur  beigefügten  Anmerkun- \ngen. (Siehe  das  nebenstehende  Blatt.) \nDas  Volk  rührt  sich  hier  sehr  lebhaft  durcheinander;  be- \nsonders in  einigen  Straßen,  wo  Kaufläden  und  Hand- \nwerksbuden aneinander  stoßen,  sieht  es  recht  lustig  aus. \nDa  ist  nicht  etwa  eine  Tür  vor  dem  Laden  oder  Arbeits- \nzimmer, nein,  die  ganze  Breite  des  Hauses  ist  often, \nman  sieht  bis  in  die  Tiefe  und  alles,  was  darin  vorgeht. \nDie  Schneider  nähen,  die  Schuster  ziehen  und  pochen \nalle  halb  auf  der  Gasse;  ja  die  Werkstätten  machen  einen \nTeil  der  Straße.  Abends,  wenn  Lichter  brennen,  sieht  es \nrecht  lebendig. \n\nAuf  den  Plätzen  ist  es  an  Markttagen  sehr  voll.  Gemüse \nund  Früchte  unübersehlich,  Knoblauch  und  Zwiebeln \nnach  Herzenslust.  Übrigens  schreien,  schäkern  und  singen \nsie  den  ganzen  Tag,  werfen  und  balgen  sich,  jauchzen \nund  lachen  unaufhörlich.  Die  milde  Luft,  die  wohlfeile \nNahrung  läßt  sie  leicht  leben.  Alles,  was  nur  kann,  ist \nunter  freiem  Himmel. \n\nNachts  geht  nun  das  Singen  und  Lärmen  recht  an.  Das \nLiedchen  von  Marlborough  hört  man  auf  allen  Straßen, \ndann  ein  Hackebrett,  eine  Violine.  Sie  üben  sich,  alle \nVögel  mit  Pfeifen  nachzumachen.  Die  wunderlichsten \nTöne  brechen  überall  hervor.  Ein  solches  Übergefühl  des \nDaseins  verleiht  ein  mildes  Klima  auch  der  Armut,  und \nder  Schatten  des  Volks  scheint  selbst  noch  ehrwürdig. \nDie  uns  so  sehr  auffallende  Unreinlichkeit  und  wenige \nBe(iuemlichkeit  der  Häuser  entspringt  auch  daher:  sie \nsind  immer  draußen,  und  in  ihrer  Sorglosigkeit  denken \nsie  an  nichts.  Dem  Volk  ist  alles  recht  und  gut;  der \nMittelmann  lebt  auch  von  einem  Tag  zum  andern;   der \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  53 \n\nVergleichlingskreis \n\nder  italienischen  und  deutschen  Uhr,  auch  der  italienischen \nZeiger  für  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  Septembers. \n\nM  i  1 1  a  ?. \n\n\nMitternacht. \n\nDi2  Nacht  wächst  mit  jedem  halben  Monat  eine  halbe  Stunde. \n\nMonat.

Ihre \nGesellschaften  halten  sie  in  öfifentlichen  Versammlungs- \nhiiusern.  Vorhöfe  und  Säulengänge  sind  alle  mit  Unrat \nbesudelt,  und  es  geht  ganz  natürlich  zu.  Das  Volk  fühlt \nsich  immer  vor.  Der  Reiche  kann  reich  sein,  Paläste \nbauen,  der  Nobile  darf  regieren,  aber  wenn  er  einen \nSäulengang,  einen  Vorhof  anlegt,  so  bedient  sich  das \nVolk  dessen  zu  seinem  Bedürfnis,  und  es  hat  kein  drin- \ngenderes, als  das  so  schnell  wie  möglich  loszuwerden, \nwas  es  so  häufig  als  möglich  zu  sich  genommen  hat.  Will \neiner  das  nicht  leiden,  so  muß  er  nicht  den  großen  Herrn \nspielen,  d.  h.  er  muß  nicht  tun,  als  wenn  ein  Teil  seiner \nWohnung  dem  Publikum  angehöre;  er  macht  seine  Türe \nzu,  und  so  ist  es  auch  gut.  An  öffentlichen  Gebäuden \nläßt  sich  das  Volk  sein  Recht  nun  gar  nicht  nehmen, \nund  das  ist's,  worüber  der  Fremde  durch  ganz  Italien \nBeschwerde  führt. \n\nIch  betrachtete  heut,  auf  mancherlei  Wegen  durch  die \nStadt,  die  Tracht  und  die  Manieren  besonders  des  Mittel- \nstandes, der  sich  sehr  häufig  und  geschäftig  zeigt.  Sie \nschlenkern  im  Gehen  alle  mit  den  Armen.  Personen  von \neinem  höhern  Stande,  die  bei  gewissen  Gelegenheiten \neinen  Degen  tragen,  schlenkern  nur  mit  ci/icm,  weil  sie \ngewohnt  sind,  den  linken  still  zu  halten. \nObgleich  das  Volk  seinen  Geschäften  und  Bedürfnissen \nsehr  sorglos  nachgeht,  so  hat  es  doch  auf  alles  Fremde \nein  scharfes  Auge.  So  könnt'  ich  die  ersten  Tage  be- \nmerken, daß  jedermann  meine  Stiefeln  betrachtete,  da \nman  sich  derselben  als  einer  feuern  Tracht  nicht  einmal \nim  Winter  bedient.  Jetzt,  da  ich  Schuh  und  Strümpfe \ntrage,  sieht  mich  niemand  mehr  an.  Aber  merkwürdig \nwar  mir's,  daß  heute  früh,  da  sie  alle  mit  Blumen,  Ge- \nmüse, Knoblauch  und  so  vielen  andern  Markterzeugnissen \ndurcheinander  liefen,  ihnen  der  Zypressenzweig  nicht  ent- \nging, den  ich  in  der  Hand  trug.  Einige  grüne  Zapfen \nhingen  daran,  und  daneben  hielt  ich  blühende  Kapem- \nzweige.  Sie  sahen  alle,  groß  und  klein,  mir  auf  die  Finger \nund  schienen  wunderliche  Gedanken  zu  haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  55 \n\nDiese  Zweige  bracht'  ich  aus  dem  Garten  Giusti,  der  eine \ntrefifliche  Lage  und  ungeheure  Zypressen  hat,  die  alle \npfriemenartig  in  die  Luft  stehen.  Wahrscheinlich  sind  die \nspitz  zugeschnittenen  Taxus  der  nordischen  Gartenkunst \nNachahmungen  dieses  herrlichen  Naturprodukts.  Ein \nBaum,  dessen  Zweige  von  unten  bis  oben,  die  ältesten \nwie  die  jüngsten,  gen  Himmel  streben,  der  seine  drei- \nhundert Jahre  dauert,  ist  wohl  der  Verehrung  wert.  Der \nZeit  nach,  da  der  Garten  angelegt  worden,  haben  diese \nschon  ein  so  hohes  Alter  erreicht. \n\nViccfiza,  den  ig.  Seftember. \nDer  Weg  von  Verona  hieher  ist  sehr  angenehm:  man  fährt \nnordostwärts  an  den  Gebirgen  hin  und  hat  die  Vorder- \nberge, die  aus  Sand,  Kalk,  Ton,  Mergel  bestehen,  immer \nlinker  Hand;  auf  den  Hügeln,  die  sie  bilden,  liegen  Orte, \nSchlösser,  Häuser.  Rechts  verbreitet  sich  die  weite  Fläche , \ndurch  die  man  fährt.  Der  gerade,  gut  unterhaltene,  breite \nWeg  geht  durch  fruchtbares  Feld;  man  blickt  in  tiefe  Baum- \nreihen, an  welchen  die  Reben  in  die  Höhe  gezogen  sind, \ndie  sodann,  als  wären  es  luftige  Zweige,  herunterfallen. \nHier  kann  man  sich  eine  Idee  von  Festonen  bilden!  Die \nTrauben  sind  zeitig  und  beschweren  die  Ranken,  die  lang \nund  schwankend  niederhängen.  Der  Weg  ist  voll  Menschen \naller  Art  und  Gewerbes;  besonders  freuten  mich  die  Wagen \nmit  niedrigen,  tellerartigen  Rädern,  die,  mit  vier  Ochsen \nbespannt,  große  Kufen  hin  und  wieder  führen,  in  welchen \ndie  Weintrauben  aus  den  Gärten  geholt  und  gestampft \nwerden.  Die  Führer  standen,  wenn  sie  leer  waren,  drinnen; \nes  sah  einem  Bacchischen  Triumphzug  ganz  ähnlich. \nZwischen  den  Weinreihen  ist  der  Boden  zu  allerlei  Arten \nGetreide,  besonders  zu  Türkischkorn  und  Sörgel  benutzt. \nKommt  man  gegen  Vicenza,  so  steigen  wieder  Hügel  von \nNorden  nach  Süden  auf — sie  sind  vulkanisch,  sagt  man \n— und  schließen  die  Ebene.  Vicenza  liegt  an  ihrem  Fuße \nund,  wenn  man  will,  in  einem  Busen,  den  sie  bilden. \n\nVor  einigen  Stunden  bin  ich  hier  angekommen,  habe  schon \ndie  Stadt  durchlaufen,  das  Olympische  Theater  und  die \n\n\n5  6  ITALTENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nGebäude  des  Palladio  gesehen.  Man  hat  ein  sehr  artiges \n]5üchelchen  mit  Kupfern  zur  Bequemlichkeit  der  Fremden \nherausgegeben,  mit  einem  kunstverständigen 'I'exte.  Wenn \nman  nun  diese  Werke  gegenwärtig  sieht,  so  erkennt  man \nerst  den  großen  Wert  derselben:  denn  sie  sollen  ja  durch \nilire  wirkliche  Größe  und  Körperlichkeit  das  Auge  füllen \nund  durch  die  schöne  Harmonie  ihrer  Dimensionen  nicht \nnur  in  abstrakten  Aufrissen,  sondern  mit  dem  ganzen  per- \nspektivischen Vordringen  und  Zurückweichen  den  Geist \nbefriedigen;  und  so  sag'  ich  vom  Palladio:  er  ist  ein  recht \ninnerlich  und  von  innen  heraus  großer  Mensch  gewesen. \nDie  höchste  Schwierigkeit,  mit  der  dieser  Mann,  wie  alle \nneuern  Architekten,  zu  kämpfen  hatte,  ist  die  schickliche \nAnwendung  der  Säulenordnungen  in  der  bürgerlichen  Bau- \nkunst: denn  Säulen  und  Mauern  zu  verbinden,  bleibt  doch \nimmer  ein  Widerspruch.  Aber  wie  er  das  untereinander \ngearbeitet  hat,  wie  er  durch  die  Gegenwart  seiner  Werke \nimponiert  und  vergessen  macht,  daß  er  nur  überredet!  Es \nist  wirklich  etwas  Göttliches  in  seinen  Anlagen,  völlig  wie \ndie  Force  des  großen  Dichters,  der  aus  Walu-heit  und \nLüge  ein  Drittes  bildet,  dessen  erborgtes  Dasein  uns  be- \nzaubert. \n\nDas  Olympische  Theater  ist  ein  Theater  der  Alten,  im \nkleinen  realisiert,  und  unaussprechlich  schön,  aber  gegen \ndie  unsrigen  kömmt  mir's  vor  wie  ein  vornehmes,  reiches, \nwohlgebildetes  Kind  gegen  einen  klugen  Wcltmenschen, \nder,  weder  so  vornehm  noch  so  reich,  noch  wohlgebildet, \nbesser  weiß,  was  er  mit  seinen  Mitteln  bewirken  kann. \nBeti-achtet  man  nun  hier  am  Orte  die  herrlichen  Gebäude, \ndie  jener  Mann  auffiihrte,  und  sieht,  wie  sie  schon  durch \ndas  enge  schmutzige  Bedürfnis  der  Menschen  entstellt \nsind,  wie  die  Anlagen  meist  über  die  Kräfte  der  Unter- \nnehmer Avaren,  wie  wenig  diese  köstlichen  Denkmale  eines \nhohen  Menschengeistes  zu  dem  Leben  der  übrigen  passen, \nso  fällt  einem  denn  doch  ein,  daß  es  in  allem  andern  eben- \nso ist:  denn  man  verdient  wenig  Dank  von  den  Menschen, \nwenn  man  ihr  inneres  Bedürfnis  erhöhen,  ihnen  eine  große \nIdee  von  ihnen  selbst  geben,  ihnen  das  Herrliche  eines \nwahren  edlen  Daseins  zum  Gefühl  bringen  will.     Aber \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  57 \n\nwenn  man  die  Vögel  belügt,  Märchen  erzählt,  von  Tag  zu \nTag  ihnen  forthelfend  sie  verschlechtert,  da  ist  man  ihr \nMann,  imd  darum  gefällt  sich  die  neuere  Zeit  in  so  viel \nAbgeschmacktem.  Ich  sage  das  nicht,  um  meine  Freunde \nherunterzusetzen,  ich  sage  nur,  daß  sie  so  sind  und  daß \nman  sich  nicht  verwundern  muß,  wenn  alles  ist,  wie \nes  ist. \n\nWie  sich  die  Basilika  des  Palladio  neben  einem  alten,  mit \nungleichen  Fenstern  übersäten,  kastellähnhchen  Gebäude \nausnimmt,  welches  der  Baumeister  zusamt  dem  Turm \ngewiß  weggedacht  hat,  ist  nicht  auszudrücken,  und  ich \nmuß  mich  schon  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  zusammen- \nfassen: denn  ich  finde  auch  hier — leider  gleich!  —  das, \nwas  ich  fliehe  und  suche,  nebeneinander. \n\nDen  20.  September. \nGestern  war  Oper,  sie  dauerte  bis  nach  Mitternacht,  und \nich  sehnte  mich  zu  ruhen.  \"Die  drei  Sultaninnen\"  und  \"Die \nEntführung  aus  dem  Serail\"  haben  manche  Fetzen  her- \ngegeben, woraus  das  Stück  mit  weniger  Klugheit  zu- \nsammengeflickt ist.  Die  Musik  hört  sich  bequem  an,  ist \naber  wahrscheinlich  von  einem  Liebhaber;  kein  neuer \nGedanke,  der  mich  getroffen  hätte.  Die  Ballette  dagegen \nsind  allerliebst.  Das  Hauptpaar  tanzte  eine  Allemande, \ndaß  man  nichts  Zierlicheres  sehen  konnte. \nDas  Theater  ist  neu,  lieblich,  schön,  modest-prächtig, \nalles  uniform,  wie  es  einer  Provinzialstadt  geziemt;  jede \nLoge  hat  ihren  übergeschlagenen,  gleichfarbigen  Teppich, \ndie  des  Capitan  Grande  ist  nur  durch  einen  etwas  längern \nÜberhang  ausgezeichnet. \n\nDie  erste  Sängerin,  vom  ganzen  Volke  sehr  begünstigt, \nwird,  wie  sie  auftritt,  entsetzlich  beklatscht,  und  die  Vögel \nstellen  sich  vor  Freuden  ganz  ungebärdig,  wenn  sie  etwas \nrecht  gut  macht,  welches  sehr  oft  geschieht.  Es  ist  ein \nnatürlich  Wesen,  hübsche  Figur,  schöne  Stimme,  ein  ge- \nfällig Gesicht  und  von  einem  recht  honetten  Anstand;  in \nden  Armen  könnte  sie  etwas  mehr  Grazie  haben.  In- \ndessen komme  ich  denn  doch  nicht  wieder;  ich  fühle,  daß \nich  zum  Vogel  verdorben  bin. \n\n\n58  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  21 .  September. \nHeute  besuchte  ich  Dr.  Turra;  wohl  fünf  Jahre  hat  er  sich \nmit  Leidenschaft  auf  die  Pflanzenkunde  gelegt,  ein  Herba- \nrium der  italienischen  Flora  gesammelt,  unter  dem  vorigen \nBischof  einen  botanischen  Garten  eingerichtet.  Das  ist \naber  alles  hin.  Medizinische  Praxis  vertrieb  die  Natur- \ngeschichte, das  Herbarium  wird  von  Würmern  gespeist, \nder  Bischof  ist  tot,  und  der  botanische  Garten  wieder, \nwie  billig,  mit  Kohl  und  Knoblauch  bepflanzt. \nDr.  Turra  ist  ein  gar  feiner  guter  Mann.  Er  erzählte  mir \nmit  Offenheit,  Seelenreinheit  und  Bescheidenheit  seine \nGeschichte  und  sprach  überhaupt  sehr  bestimmt  und  ge- \nfällig, hatte  aber  nicht  Lust,  seine  Schränke  aufzutun,  die \nvielleicht  in  keinem  präsentablen  Zustande  sein  mochten. \nDer  Diskurs  kam  bald  ins  Stocken. \n\nAbends. \nIch  ging  zum  alten  I'aumeister  Scamozzi,  der  des  Palladio \nGebäude  herausgegeben  hat  und  ein  wackerer,  leiden- \nschaftlicher Künstler  ist.  Er  gab  mir  einige  Anleitung, \nvergnügt  über  meine  Teilnahme.  Unter  den  Gebäuden \ndes  Palladio  ist  eins,  für  das  ich  immer  eine  besondere \nVorliebe  hatte,  es  soll  seine  eigne  Wohnung  gewesen  sein; \naber  in  der  Nähe  ist  es  weit  mehr,  als  man  im  Bilde  sieht. \nIch  möchte  es  gezeichnet  und  mit  den  Farben  illuminiert \nhaben,  die  ihm  das  Material  und  das  Alter  gegeben.  Man \nmuß  aber  nicht  denken,  daß  der  Baumeister  sich  einen \nPalast  errichtet  habe.  Es  ist  das  bescheidenste  Haus  von \nder  Welt,  hat  nur  zwei  Fenster,  die  durch  einen  breiten \nRaum,  der  das  dritte  Fenster  vertrüge,  abgesondert  sind. \nWollte  man  es  zumCiemälde  nachbilden,  so  daß  die  Nach- \nbarhäuser mit  vorgestellt  würden,  so  wäre  auch  das  ver- \ngnüglich anzusehen,  wie  es  zwischen  sie  eingeschaltet  ist. \nDas  hätte  Canaletto  malen  sollen. \n\nHeute  besuchte  ich  das  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  der  Stadt \nauf  einer  angenehmen  Höhe  liegende  Prachthaus,  die \nRotonda  genannt.  Es  ist  ein  viereckiges  Gebäude,  das \neinen  runden,  von  oben  erleuchteten  Saal  in  sich  schließt. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  59 \n\nVon  allen  vier  Seiten  steigt  man  auf  breiten  Treppen \nhinan  und  gelangt  jedesmal  in  eine  Vorhalle,  die  von \nsechs  korinthischen  Säulen  gebildet  wird.  Vielleicht  hat \ndie  Baukunst  iliren  Luxus  niemals  höher  getrieben.  Der \nRaum,  den  die  Treppen  und  Vorhallen  einnehmen,  ist \nviel  größer  als  der  des  Hauses  selbst;  denn  jede  einzelne \nSeite  würde  als  Ansicht  eines  Tempels  befriedigen.  In- \nwendig kann  man  es  wohnbar,  aber  nicht  wohnlich \nnennen.  Der  Saal  ist  von  der  schönsten  Proportion,  die \nZimmer  auch;  aber  zu  den  Bedürfnissen  eines  Sommer- \naufenthalts einer  vornehmen  Familie  würden  sie  kaum \nhinreichen.  Dafür  sieht  man  es  auch  in  der  ganzen  Gegend, \nvon  allen  Seiten,  sich  auf  das  herrlichste  darstellen.  Die \nMannigfaltigkeit  ist  groß,  in  der  sich  seine  Hauptmasse \nzugleich  mit  den  vorspringenden  Säulen  vor  dem  Auge \nder  Umherwandelnden  bewegt,  und  die  Absicht  des  Be- \nsitzers ist  vollkommen  erreicht,  der  ein  großes  Fidei- \nkommißgut  und  zugleich  ein  sinnliches  Denkmal  seines \nVermögens  hinterlassen  wollte.  Und  wie  nun  das  Ge- \nbäude von  allen  Punkten  der  Gegend  in  seiner  Herrlich- \nkeit gesehen  wird,  so  ist  die  Aussicht  von  daher  gleich- \nfalls die  angenehmste.  Man  sieht  den  Bachiglione  fließen, \nSchifte  von  Verona  herab  gegen  die  Brenta  führend;  dabei \nüberschaut  man  die  weiten  Besitzungen,  welche  Marchese \nCapra  unzertrennt  bei  seiner  Familie  erhalten  wollte.  Die \nInschriften  der  vier  Giebelseiten,  die  zusammen  eine \nganze  ausmachen,  verdienen  wohl  aufgezeichnet  zu  werden: \nMarcus  Capra  Gabrielis  filius \nqui  aedes  has \narctissimo  primogeniturae  gradui  subjecit \nuna  cum  Omnibus \ncensibus  agris  vallibus  et  collibus \n\ncitra  viam  magnam \nmemoriae  perpetuae  mandans  haec \ndum  sustinet  ac  abstinet. \nDer  Schluß  besonders  ist  seltsam  genug:  ein  Mann,  dem \nso  viel  Vermögen  und  Wille  zu  Gebote  stand,  fühlt  noch, \ndaß  er  dulden  und  entbehren  müsse.    Das  kann  man  mit \ngerinsferm  Aufwand  lernen. \n\n\n6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  22.  September. \nHeute  abend  war  ich  in  einer  Versammlung,  welche  die \nAkademie  der  Olympier  hielt.  Ein  Spielwerk,  aber  ein \nrecht  gutes;  es  erhält  noch  ein  bißchen  Salz  und  Leben \nunter  den  Leuten.  Ein  großer  Saal  neben  dem  Theater \ndes  Palladio,  anständig  erleuchtet,  der  Capitan  und  ein \nTeil  des  Adels  zugegen,  übrigens  durchaus  ein  Publikum \nvon  gebildeten  Personen,  viele  Geistliche,  zusammen  ohn- \ngefähr  fünfhundert. \n\nDie  von  dem  Präsidenten  für  die  heutige  Sitzung  auf- \ngegebene Frage  war:  ob  Erfindung  oder  Nachahmung  den \nschönen  Künsten  melir  Vorteil  gebracht  habe?  Der  Ein- \nfall war  glücklich  genug;  denn  wenn  man  die  in  der  Frage \nliegende  Alternative  trennt,  so  läßt  sich  hundert  Jahre \nhinüber  und  herüber  sprechen.  Auch  haben  sich  die \nHerrn  Akademiker  dieser  Gelegenheit  weidlich  bedient \nund  in  Prosa  und  Versen  mancherlei  hervorgebracht,  wor- \nunter viel  Gutes. \n\nSodann  ist  es  das  lebendigste  Publikum.  Die  Zuhörer \nriefen  bravo,  klatschten  und  lachten.  Wenn  man  auch \nvor  seiner  Nation  so  stehen  und  sie  persönlich  belustigen \ndürfte!  Wir  geben  unser  Bestes  schwarz  auf  weiß:  jeder \nkauzt  sich  damit  in  eine  Ecke  und  knopert  daran,  wie  er \nkann. \n\nEs  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  Palladio  auch  diesmal  an  allen \nOrten  und  Enden  war,  es  mochte  vom  Erfinden  oder \nNachahmen  die  Rede  sein.  Zuletzt,  wo  immer  das  Scherz- \nliafteste  gefordert  wird,  hatte  einer  den  glücklichen  Ein- \nfall, zu  sagen:  die  andern  hätten  ihm  den  Palladio  weg- \ngenommen, er  wolle  dagegen  den  Franceschini  loben, \nden  großen  Seidenfabrikanten.  Nun  fing  er  an,  zu  zeigen, \nwas  die  Nachahmung  der  Lyoner  und  Florentiner  Stoffe \ndiesem  tüchtigen  Unternehmer  und  durch  ihn  der  Stadt \nVicenza  für  Vorteil  gebracht  habe,  woraus  erfolge,  daß \ndie  Nachahmung  weit  über  die  Erfindung  erhaben  sei. \nUnd  dies  geschah  mit  so  gutem  Humor,  daß  ein  ununter- \nbrochenes Gelächter  erregt  ward.  Überhaupt  fanden  die, \nwelche  für  die  Nachahmung  sprachen,  mehr  Beifall;  denn \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  61 \n\nsie  sagten  lauter  Dinge,  wie  sie  der  Haufen  denkt  und \ndenken  kann.  Einmal  gab  das  Publikum  mit  großem \nHändeklatschen  einem  recht  groben  Sophism  seinen  herz- \nlichen Beifall,  da  es  viele  gute,  ja  treffliche  Sachen  zu \nEhren  der  Erfindung  nicht  gefühlt  hatte.  Es  freut  mich \nsehr,  auch  dieses  erlebt  zu  haben,  und  dann  ist  es  höchst \nerquickend,  den  Palladio  nach  so  viel  Zeit  immer  noch \nals  Polarstern  und  Musterbild  von  seinen  Mitbürgern  ver- \nehrt zu  sehen. \n\nVicenza^  den  23.  September. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  in  Tiene,  das  nordwärts  gegen  die \nGebirge  liegt,  wo  ein  neu  Gebäude  nach  einem  alten \nRisse  aufgeführt  wird,  wobei  wenig  zu  erinnern  sein \nmöchte.  So  ehrt  man  hier  alles  aus  der  guten  Zeit  und \nhat  Sinn  genug,  nach  einem  geerbten  Plan  ein  frisches \nGebäude  aufzuführen.  Das  Schloß  liegt  ganz  trefilich  in \neiner  großen  Plaine,  die  Kalkalpen  ohne  Zwischengebirg \nhinter  sich.  Vom  Gebäude  her,  neben  der  schnurgeraden \nChaussee,  fließt  zu  beiden  Seiten  lebendiges  Wasser  dem \nKommenden  entgegen  und  wässert  die  weiten  Reisfelder, \ndurch  die  man  fährt. \n\nIch  habe  nun  erst  die  zwei  italienischen  Städte  gesehen \nund  mit  wenig  Menschen  gesprochen,  aber  ich  kenne \nmeine  Italiener  schon  gut.  Sie  sind  wie  Hofleute,  die \nsich  fürs  erste  Volk  in  der  Welt  halten  und  bei  gewissen \nVorteilen,  die  man  ihnen  nicht  leugnen  kann,  sich's  un- \ngestraft und  bequem  einbilden  können.  Mir  erscheinen  die \nItaliener  als  eine  recht  gute  Nation:  man  muß  nur  die \nKinder  und  die  gemeinen  Leute  sehen,  wie  ich  sie  jetzt \nsehe  und  sehen  kann,  da  ich  ihnen  immer  ausgesetzt  bin \nund  mich  ihnen  immer  aussetze.  Und  was  das  für  Figuren \nund  Gesichter  sind! \n\nBesonders  muß  ich  die  Vicentiner  loben,  daß  man  bei \nihnen  die  Vorrechte  einer  großen  Stadt  genießt.  Sie  sehen \neinen  nicht  an,  man  mag  machen,  was  man  will;  wendet \nman  sich  jedoch  an  sie,  dann  sind  sie  gesprächig  und  an- \nmutig, besonders  wollen  mir  die  Frauen  sehr  gefallen. \nDie  Veroneserinnen  will  ich  nicht  schelten,  sie  haben  eine \n\n\n62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngute  Bildung  und  entschiedeneProfile;  aber  meistens  bleich, \nund  der  Zendal  tut  ihnen  Schaden,  weil  man  unter  der \nschönen  Tracht  auch  etwas  Reizendes  sucht.  Hier  aber \nfinde  ich  gar  hübsche  Wesen,  besonders  eine  schwarz- \nlockige Sorte,  die  mir  ein  eigenes  Interesse  einflößt.  Es \ngibt  auch  noch  eine  blonde,  die  mir  aber  nicht  so  be- \nhagen will. \n\nPadiia^  den  26.  September  abends. \nIn  vier  Stunden  bin  ich  heute  von  Vicenza  herübergefahren, \nauf  ein  einsitziges  Chaischen,  Sediola  genannt,  mit  meiner, \nganzen  Existenz  gepackt.  Man  fährt  sonst  bequem  in  viert- \nhalb Stunden;  da  ich  aber  den  köstlichen  Tag  gern  unter \nfreiem  Himmel  genießen  wollte,  so  war  es  mir  angenehm, \ndaß  der  Vetturin  hinter  seiner  Schuldigkeit  zurückblieb. \nMan  fährt  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Ebene  immer  südostwärts, \nzwischen  Hecken  und  Bäumen,  ohne  weitere  Aussicht,  bis \nman  endlich  die  schönen  Gebirge,  von  Norden  gegen \nSüden  streichend,  zur  rechten  Hand  sieht.  Die  Fülle  der \nPflanzen-  und  Fruchtgehänge,  über  Mauern  und  Hecken, \nan  Bäumen  herunter,  ist  unbesclireiblich.  Kürbisse  be- \nschweren die  Dächer,  und  die  wunderlichsten  Gurken \nhängen  an  Latten  und  Spalieren. \n\nDie  herrliche  Lage  der  Stadt  konnte  ich  vom  Observa- \ntorium aufs  klarste  überschauen.  Gegen  Norden  Tiroler \nGebirge,  beschneit,  in  Wolken  halb  versteckt,  an  die \nsich  in  Nordwest  die  Vicentinischen  anschließen,  endlich \ngegen  Westen  die  näheren  Gebirge  von  Este,  deren  Ge- \nstalten und  Vertiefungen  man  deutlich  sehen  kann.  Gegen \nSüdost  ein  grünes  Pflanzenmeer,  ohne  eine  Spur  von \nErhöhung,  Baum  an  Baum,  Busch  an  Busch,  Pflanzung \nan  Pflanzung,  unzählige  weiße  Häuser,  Villen  und  Kirchen \naus  dem  Grünen  hervorblickend.  Am  Horizont  sah  ich \nganz  deutlich  den  Markusturm  zu  Venedig  und  andere \ngeringere  Türme. \n\nFadi/a^  den  27.  September. \nEndlich  hab'  ich  die  Werke  des  Palladio  erlangt,  zwar \nnicht  die  Originalausgabe,  die  ich  in  Vicenza  gesehen, \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  St, \n\nderen  Tafeln  in  Holz  geschnitten  sind,  aber  eine  genaue \nKopie,  ja  ein  Faksimile  in  Kupfer,  veranstaltet  durch  einen \nvortrefflichen  Mann,  den  ehemaligen  englischen  Konsul \nSmith  in  Venedig.  Das  muß  man  den  Engländern  lassen, \ndaß  sie  von  lange  her  das  Gute  zu  schätzen  wußten \nund  daß  sie  eine  grandiose  Art  haben,  es  zu  verbreiten. \nBei  Gelegenheit  dieses  Ankaufs  betrat  ich  einen  Buch- \nladen, der  in  Italien  ein  ganz  eigenes  Ansehen  hat.  Alle \nBücher  stehen  geheftet  umher,  und  man  findet  den  ganzen \nTag  über  gute  Gesellschaft.  Was  von  Weltgeistlichen, \nEdelleuten,  Künstlern  einigermaßen  mit  der  Literatur \nverwandt  ist,  geht  hier  auf  und  ab.  Man  verlangt  ein \nBuch,  schlägt  nach,  liest  und  unterhält  sich,  wie  es  kommen \nwill.  So  fand  ich  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  beisammen, \nwelche  sämtlich,  als  ich  nach  den  Werken  des  Palladio \nfragte,  auf  mich  aufmerksam  wurden.  Indes  der  Herr  des \nLadens  das  Buch  suchte,  rühmten  sie  es  und  gaben  mir \nNotiz  von  dem  Originale  und  der  Kopie;  sie  waren  mit \ndem  Werke  selbst  und  dem  Verdienst  des  Verfassers \nsehr  wohl  bekannt.  Da  sie  mich  für  einen  Architekten \nhielten,  lobten  sie  mich,  daß  ich  vor  allen  andern  zu  den \nStudien  dieses  Meisters  schritte;  er  leiste  zu  Gebrauch \nund  Anwendung  mehr  als  Vitruv  selbst,  denn  er  habe \ndie  Alten  und  das  Altertum  gründlich  studiert  und  es \nunsern  Bedürfnissen  näher  zu  führen  gesucht.  Ich  unter- \nhielt mich  lange  mit  diesen  freundlichen  Männern,  er- \nfuhr noch  einiges,  die  Denkwürdigkeiten  der  Stadt  be- \ntreffend, und  empfahl  mich. \n\nDa  man  denn  doch  einmal  den  Heiligen  Kirchen  gebaut \nhat,  so  findet  sich  auch  wohl  darin  ein  Platz,  wo  man \nvernünftige  Menschen  aufstellen  kann.  Die  Büste  des \nKardinals  Bembo  steht  zwischen  ionischen  Säulen,  ein \nschönes,  wenn  ich  so  sagen  soll  mit  Gewalt  in  sich  ge- \nzogenes Gesicht  und  ein  mächtiger  Bart;  die  Inschrift \nlautet: \n\nPetri  Bembi  Card,  imaginem  Hier.  Guerinus  Ismeni  f.  in \n\npublico  ponendam  curavit  ut  cujus  ingenii  monumenta \n\naeterna  sint  ejus  corporis  quoque  memoria  ne  a  poste- \n\nritate  desideretur. \n\n\n64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDas  Universitätsgebäude  hat  mich  mit  aller  seiner  Würde \nerschreckt.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  darin  nichts  zu  lernen \nhatte.  Eine  solche  Schulenge  denkt  man  sich  nicht,  ob \nman  gleich  als  Studiosus  deutscher  Akademien  auf  den \nHörbänken  auch  manches  leiden  müssen.  Besonders  ist \ndas  anatomische  Theater  ein  Muster,  wie  man  Schüler \nzusammenpressen  soll.  In  einem  spitzen  hohen  Trichter \nsind  die  Zuhörer  übereinander  geschichtet.  Sie  sehen \nsteil  herunter  auf  den  engen  Boden,  wo  der  Tisch  steht, \nauf  den  kein  Licht  fällt;  deshalb  der  Lehrer  bei  Lampen- \nschein demonstrieren  muß.  Der  botanische  Garten  ist \ndesto  artiger  und  munterer.  Es  können  viele  Pflanzen \nauch  den  Winter  im  Lande  bleiben,  wenn  sie  an  Mauern \noder  nicht  weit  davon  gesetzt  sind.  Man  überbaut  als- \ndann das  Ganze  zu  Ende  des  Oktobers  und  heizt  die \nwenigen  Monate.  Es  ist  erfreuend  und  belehrend,  unter \neiner  Vegetation  umherzugehen,  die  uns  fremd  ist.  Bei \ngewohnten  Pflanzen,  sowie  bei  andern  längst  bekannten \nGegenständen,  denken  wir  zuletzt  gar  nichts;  und  was  ist \nBeschauen  ohne  Denken?  Hier  in  dieser  neu  mir  ent- \ngegentretenden Mannigfaltigkeit  wird  jener  Gedanke \nimmer  lebendiger,  daß  man  sich  alle  Pflanzengestalten \nvielleicht  aus  ei7icr  entwickeln  könne.  Hierdurch  würde \nes  allein  möglich  werden,  Geschlechter  und  Arten  wahr- \nhaft zu  bestimmen,  welches,  wie  mich  dünkt,  bisher  sehr \nwillkürlich  geschieht.  Auf  diesem  Punkte  bin  ich  in  meiner \nbotanischen  Philosophie  stecken  geblieben,  und  ich  sehe \nnoch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich  entwirren  will.  Die  Tiefe  und \nBreite  dieses  Geschäfts  scheint  mir  völlig  gleich. \nDer  große  Platz,  Prato  della  Valle  genannt,  ist  ein  selir \nweiter  Raum,  wo  der  Hauptmarkt  im  Juni  gehalten  wird. \nHölzerne  Buden  in  seiner  Mitte  geben  freilich  nicht  das \nvorteilhafteste  Ansehen,  die  Einwohner  aber  versichern, \ndaß  man  auch  bald  hier  eine  Fiera  von  Stein,  wie  die \nzu  Verona,  sehen  werde.  Hiezu  gibt  freilich  schon  jetzt  die \nUmgebung  des  Platzes  gegründete  Hoftnung,  welche  einen \nsehr  schönen  und  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährt. \nEin  ungeheures  Oval  ist  ringsum  mit  Statuen  besetzt,  alle \nberühmte  Männer  vorstellend,  welche  hier  gelehrt  und \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  65 \n\ngelernt  haben.  Einem  jeden  Einheimischen  und  Fremden \nist  erlaubt,  irgend  einem  Landsmann  oder  Verwandten \nhier  eine  Bildsäule  von  bestimmter  Größe  zu  errichten, \nsobald  das  Verdienst  der  Person  und  der  akademische \nAufenthalt  zu  Padua  bewiesen  ist. \n\nUm  das  Oval  umher  geht  ein  Wassergraben.  Auf  den \nvier  Brücken,  die  hinaufführen,  stehen  Päpste  und  Dogen \nkolossal;  die  übrigen,  kleiner,  sind  von  Zünften,  Partiku- \nliers  und  Fremden  gesetzt.  Der  König  von  Schweden \nließ  Gustav  Adolfen  hinstellen,  weil  man  sagt,  derselbe \nhabe  einmal  in  Padua  eine  Lektion  angehört.  Der  Erz- \nherzog Leopold  erneuerte  das  Andenken  Petrarchs  und \nGalileis.  Die  Statuen  sind  in  einer  braven  modernen \nManier  gemacht,  wenige  übermanieriert,  einige  recht \nnatürlich,  sämtlich  im  Kostüm  ihrer  Zeit  und  Würden. \nDie  Inschriften  sind  auch  zu  loben.  Es  findet  sich  nichts \nAbgeschmacktes  oder  Kleinliches  darunter. \nAuf  jeder  Universität  wäre  der  Gedanke  sehr  glücklich \ngewesen,  auf  dieser  ist  er  am  glücklichsten,  weil  es  sehr \nwohl  tut,  eine  völlige  Vergangenheit  wieder  hervorge- \nrufen zu  sehen.  Es  kann  ein  recht  schöner  Platz  werden, \nwenn  sie  die  hölzerne  Fiera  wegschafien  und  eine  von \nStein  erbauen,  wie  der  Plan  sein  soll. \n\nIn  dem  Versammlungsorte  einer  dem  heiligen  Antonius \ngewidmeten  Brüderschaft  sind  ältere  Bilder,  welche  an \ndie  alten  Deutschen  erinnern,  dabei  auch  einige  von \nTizian,  wo  schon  der  große  Fortschritt  merklich  ist,  den \nüber  den  Alpen  niemand  für  sich  getan  hat.  Gleich  dar- \nauf sah  ich  einiges  von  den  Neusten.  Diese  Künstler \nhaben,  da  sie  das  hohe  Ernste  nicht  mehr  erreichen \nkonnten,  das  Humoristische  sehr  glücklich  getroffen.  Die \nEnthauptung  Johannes'  von  Piazetta  ist,  wenn  man  des \nMeisters  Manier  zugibt,  in  diesem  Sinne  ein  recht  braves \nBild.  Johannes  kniet,  die  Hände  vor  sich  hinfaltend,  mit \ndem  rechten  Knie  an  einen  Stein.  Er  sieht  gen  Himmel. \nEin  Kriegsknecht,  der  ihn  hinten  gebunden  hält,  biegt \nsich  an  der  Seite  herum  und  sieht  ihm  ins  Gesicht,  als \nwenn  er  über  die  Gelassenheit  erstaunte,  womit  der  Mann \n\nGOETHE  IV  5 \n\n\n66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich  hingibt.  In  der  Höhe  steht  ein  anderer,  der  den \nStreich  vollführen  soll,  hat  aber  das  Schwert  nicht,  son- \ndern macht  nur  mit  den  Händen  die  Gebärde,  wie  einer, \nder  den  Streich  zum  voraus  versuchen  will.  Das  Schwert \nzieht  unten  ein  dritter  aus  der  Scheide.  Der  Gedanke \nist  glücklich,  wenn  auch  nicht  groß,  die  Komposition \nfrappant  und  von  der  besten  Wirkung. \nIn  der  Kirche  der  Eremitaner  habe  ich  Gemälde  von \nMantegna  gesehen,  einem  der  älteren  Maler,  vor  dem \nich  erstaunt  bin.  Was  in  diesen  Bildern  für  eine  scharfe, \nsichere  Gegenwart  dasteht!  Von  dieser  ganz  wahren, \nnicht  etwa  scheinbaren,  eftektlügenden,  bloß  zur  Ein- \nbildungskraft sprechenden,  sondern  derben,  reinen,  lich- \nten, ausführlichen,  gewissenhaften,  zarten,  umschriebenen \nGegenwart,  die  zugleich  etwas  Strenges,  Emsiges,  Müh- \nsames hatte,  gingen  die  folgenden  Maler  aus,  wie  ich  an \nBildern  von  Tizian  bemerkte,  und  nun  konnte  die  Leb- \nhaftigkeit ihres  Genies,  die  Energie  ihrer  Natur,  erleuchtet \nvon  dem  Geiste  ihrer  Vorfahren,  auferbaut  durch  ihre \nKraft,  immer  höher  und  höher  steigen,  sich  von  der  Erde \nheben  und  himmlische,  aber  wahre  Gestalten  hervor- \nbringen. So  entwickelte  sich  die  Kunst  nach  der  bar- \nbarischen Zeit. \n\nDer  Audienzsaal  des  Rathauses,  mit  Recht  durch  das \nAugmentativum  \"Salone\"  betitelt,  das  ungeheuerste  abge- \nschlossene Gefäß,  das  man  sich  nicht  vorstellen,  auch \nnicht  einmal  in  der  nächsten  Erinnerung  ziu\"ückrufen  kann. \nDreihundert  Euß  lang,  hundert  Euß  breit  und  bis  in  das \nder  Länge  nach  ihn  deckende  Gewölbe  hundert  Euß \nhoch.  So  gewohnt  sind  diese  Menschen,  im  Freien  zu \nleben,  daß  die  Baumeister  einen  Marktplatz  zu  über- \nwölben fanden. \n\nUnd  es  ist  keine  Frage,  daß  der  ungeheuere  überwölbte \nRaum  eine  eigene  Empfindung  gibt.  Es  ist  ein  abge- \nschloßnes  Unendliches,  dem  ISlenschen  analoger  als  der \nSternhimmel.  Dieser  reißt  uns  aus  uns  selbst  hinaus, \njener  drängt  uns,  auf  die  gelindeste  Weise,  in  uns  selbst \nzurück. \nSo  verweil  ich    auch   gern  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  67 \n\nJustine.  Diese  ist  vierhundertfünfundachtzig  Fuß  lang, \nverhältnismäßig  hoch  und  breit,  groß  und  einfach  gebaut. \nHeut'  abend  setzt'  ich  mich  in  einen  Winkel  und  hatte \nmeine  stille  Betrachtung.  Da  fühlt'  ich  mich  recht \nallein,  denn  kein  Mensch  in  der  Welt,  der  in  dem  Augen- \nblick an  mich  gedacht  hätte,  würde  mich  hier  gesucht \nhaben. \n\nNun  wäre  auch  hier  wieder  einmal  eingepackt;  morgen \nfrüh  geht  es  zu  Wasser  auf  der  Brenta  fort.  Heute  hat's \ngeregnet,  nun  ist's  wieder  ausgehellt,  und  ich  hoffe,  die \nLagunen  und  die  dem  Meer  vermählte  Herrscherin  bei \nschöner  Tageszeit  zu  erblicken  und  aus  ihrem  Schoß \nmeine  Freunde  zu  begrüßen. \n\nVENEDIG \n\nSO  stand  es  denn  im  Buche  des  Schicksals  auf  meinem \nBlatte  geschrieben,  daß  ich  1786  den  achtundzwanzig- \nsten September,  abends,  nach  unserer  Uhr  um  fünfe, \nVenedig  zum  erstenmal,  aus  der  Brenta  in  die  Lagunen \neinfahrend,  erblicken  und  bald  darauf  diese  wunderbare \nInselstadt,  diese  Biberrepublik,  betreten  und  besuchen \nsollte.  So  ist  denn  auch,  Gott  sei  Dank,  Venedig  mir  kein \nbloßes  Wort  mehr,  kein  hohler  Name,  der  mich  so  oft, \nmich,  den  Todfeind  von  Wortschällen,  geängstiget  hat. \nAls  die  erste  Gondel  an  das  Schiff  anfuhr — es  geschieht, \num  Passagiere,  welche  Eil'  haben,  geschwinder  nach \nVenedig  zu  bringen — erinnerte  ich  mich  eines  frühen \nKinderspielzeuges,  an  das  ich  vielleicht  seit  zwanzig \nJahren  nicht  mehr  gedacht  hatte.  Mein  Vater  besaß  ein \nschönes  mitgebrachtes  Gondelmodell;  er  hielt  es  sehr \nwert,  und  mir  ward  es  hoch  angerechnet,  wenn  ich  ein- \nmal damit  spielen  durfte.  Die  ersten  Schnäbel  von  blankem \nEisenblech,  die  schwarzen  Gondelkäfige,  alles  grüßte  mich \nwie  eine  alte  Bekanntschaft,  ich  genoß  einen  langent- \nbehrten freundlichen  Jugendeindruck. \nIch  bin  gut  logiert  in  der  Königin  von  England,  nicht \nweit  vom  Markusplatze,  und  dies  ist  der  größte  Vorzug \ndes  Quartiers;  meine  Fenster  gehen  auf  einen  schmalen \n\n\n68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nKanal  zwischen  hohen  Häusern,  gleich  unter  mir  eine \neinbogige  Brücke,  und  gegenüber  ein  schmales,  belebtes \nGäßchen.  So  wohne  ich,  und  so  werde  ich  eine  Zeitlang \nbleiben,  bis  mein  Paket  für  Deutschland  fertig  ist  und \nbis  ich  mich  am  Bilde  dieser  Stadt  satt  gesehen  habe. \nDie  Einsamkeit,  nach  der  ich  oft  so  sehnsuchtvoll  ge- \nseufzt, kann  ich  nun  recht  genießen;  denn  nirgends  fühlt \nman  sich  einsamer  als  im  Gewimmel,  wo  man  sich,  allen \nganz  unbekannt,  durchdrängt.  In  Venedig  kennt  mich \nvielleicht  nur  ein  Mensch,  und  der  wird  mir  nicht  gleich \nbegegnen. \n\nVenedig^  den  28.  September  j^86. \nWie  es  mir  von  Padua  hierher  gegangen,  nur  mit  wenig \nWorten:  Die  Fahrt  auf  der  Brenta,  mit  dem  öftentlichen \nSchiffe,  in  gesitteter  Gesellschaft,  da  die  Italiener  sich \nvoreinander  in  acht  nehmen,  ist  anständig  und  ange- \nnehm. Die  Ufer  sind  mit  Gärten  und  Lusthäusern  ge- \nschmückt; kleine  Ortschaften  treten  bis  ans  Wasser,  teil- \nweise geht  die  belebte  Landstraße  daran  hin.  Da  man \nschleusenweis  den  Fluß  hinabsteigt,  gibt  es  öfters  einen \nkleinen  Aufhalt,  den  man  benutzen  kann,  sich  auf  dem \nLande  umzusehen  und  die  reichlich  angebotenen  Früchte \nzu  genießen.  Nun  steigt  man  wieder  ein  und  bewegt \nsich  durch  eine  bewegte  Welt  voll  Fruchtbarkeit  und \nLeben. \n\nZu  so  viel  abwechselnden  Bildern  und  Gestalten  gesellte \nsich  noch  eine  Erscheinung,  die,  obgleich  aus  Deutsch- \nland abstammend,  doch  hier  ganz  eigentlich  an  ihrem \nPlatze  war,  zwei  Pilger  nämlich,  die  ersten,  die  ich  in \nder  Nähe  sah.  Sie  haben  das  Recht,  mit  dieser  öftent- \nlichen Gelegenheit  umsonst  weiter  gebracht  zu  werden; \nallein  weil  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  ihre  Nähe  scheut,  so \nsitzen  sie  nicht  mit  in  dem  bedeckten  Räume,  sondern \nhinten  bei  dem  Steuermann.  Als  eine  in  der  gegen- \nwärtigen Zeit  seltene  Erscheinung  wurden  sie  angestaunt \nund,  weil  früher  unter  dieser  Hülle  manch  Gesindel  um- \nhertrieb, wenig  geachtet.  Als  ich  vernahm,  daß  es  Deut- \nsche seien,  keiner  andern  Sprache  mächtig,  gesellte  ich \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  69 \n\nmich  zu  ihnen  und  vernahm,  daß  sie  aus  dem  Paderborni- \nschen herstammten.  Beides  waren  Männer  schon  über \nfünfzig,  von  dunkler,  aber  gutmütiger  Physiognomie.  Sie \nhatten  vor  allem  das  Grab  der  heiligen  drei  Könige  zu \nCöln  besucht,  waren  sodann  durch  Deutschland  gezogen \nund  nun  auf  dem  Wege,  zusammen  bis  Rom  und  sodann \nins  obere  Italien  zurückzugehen,  da  denn  der  eine  wieder \nnach  Westfalen  zu  wandern,  der  andere  aber  noch  den \nheiligen  Jakob  zu  Compostell  zu  verehren  gedachte. \nIhre  Kleidung  war  die  bekannte,  doch  sahen  sie  aufge- \nschürzt viel  besser  aus,  als  wir  sie  in  langen  Taffetkleidern \nauf  unsern  Redouten  vorzustellen  pflegen.  Der  große \nKragen,  der  runde  Hut,  der  Stab  und  die  Muschel,  als \ndas  unschuldigste  Trinkgeschirr,  alles  hatte  seine  Be- \ndeutung, seinen  unmittelbaren  Nutzen;  die  Blechkapsel \nenthielt  ihre  Pässe.  Das  Merkwürdigste  aber  waren  ihre \nkleinen  rotsaffianen  Brieftaschen;  in  diesen  befand  sich \nalles  kleine  Geräte,  was  nur  irgend  einem  einfachen  Be- \ndürfnis abzuhelfen  geeignet  sein  mochte.  Sie  hatten  die- \nselben hervorgezogen,  indem  sie  an  ihren  Kleidern  etwas \nzu  flicken  fanden. \n\nDer  Steuermann,  höchst  zufrieden,  daß  er  einen  Dol- \nmetscher fand,  ließ  mich  verschiedene  Fragen  an  sie  tun; \ndadurch  vernahm  ich  manches  von  ihren  Ansichten,  be- \nsonders aber  von  ihrer  Reise.  Sie  beklagten  sich  bitter- \nlich über  ihre  Glaubensgenossen,  ja  Weltpriester  und \nKlostergeistliche.  Die  Frömmigkeit,  sagten  sie,  müsse \neine  sehr  seltene  Sache  sein,  weil  man  an  die  ihrige  nir- \ngends glauben  wolle,  sondern  sie  fast  durchaus,  ob  sie \ngleich  die  ihnen  vorgeschriebene  geistliche  Marschroute \nimd  die  bischöflichen  Pässe  vorgezeigt,  in  katholischen \nLanden  wie  Landstreicher  behandle.  Sie  erzählten  da- \ngegen mit  Rührung,  wie  gut  sie  von  den  Protestanten \naufgenommen  worden,  besonders  von  einem  Landgeist- \nlichen in  Schwaben,  vorzüglich  aber  von  seiner  Frau, \nwelche  den  einigermaßen  widerstrebenden  Mann  dahin \nvermocht,  daß  sie  ihnen  reichliche  Erquickung  zuteilen \ndürfen,  welche  ihnen  sehr  not  getan.  Ja  beim  Abschiede \nhabe  sie  ihnen  einen  Konventionstaler  geschenkt,   der \n\n\n70  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nihnen  sehr  zustatten  gekommen,  sobald  sie  das  katho- \nlische Gebiet  wieder  betreten.  Hierauf  sagte  der  eine \nmit  aller  Erhebung,  deren  er  fähig  war:  Wir  schließen \ndiese  Frau  aber  auch  täglich  in  unser  Gebet  ein  und  bit- \nten Gott,  daß  er  ihre  Augen  öflhe,  wie  er  ihr  Herz  für \nuns  geöffnet  hat,  daß  er  sie,  wenn  auch  spät,  aufnehme \nin  den  Schoß  der  alleinseligmachenden  Kirche;  und  so \nhoffen  wir  gewiß,  ihr  dereinst  im  Paradies  zu  begegnen. \nVon  diesem  allen  erklärte  ich,  was  nötig  und  nützlich \nwar,  auf  der  kleinen  Steige  sitzend,  die  auf  das  Verdeck \nführt,  dem  Steuermanne  und  einigen  andern  Personen, \ndie  sich  aus  der  Kajüte  in  den  engen  Raum  gedrängt \nhatten.  Den  Pilgern  wurden  einige  ärmliche  Erquickun- \ngen gereicht,  denn  der  Italiener  liebt  nicht  zu  geben.  Sie \nzogen  hierauf  kleine  geweihte  Zettel  hervor,  worauf  zu \nsehen  das  Bild  der  heiligen  drei  Könige,  nebst  lateini- \nschen Gebeten  zur  Verehrung.  Die  guten  Menschen  baten \nmich,  die  kleine  Gesellschaft  damit  zu  beschenken  und \nihr  den  hohen  Wert  dieser  Blätter  begreiflich  zu  machen. \nDieses  gelang  mir  auch  ganz  gut,  denn  als  die  beiden \nMänner  sehr  verlegen  schienen,  wie  sie  in  dem  großen \nVenedig  das  zur  Aufnahme  der  Pilger  bestimmte  Kloster \nausfinden  sollten,  so  versprach  der  gerührte  Steuermann, \nwenn  sie  landeten,  wollte  er  einem  Burschen  sogleich \neinen  Dreier  geben,  damit  er  sie  zu  jenem  entfernt  ge- \nlegenen Orte  geleitete.  Sie  würden  zwar,  setzte  er  ver- \ntraulich hinzu,  sie  würden  dort  wenig  Trost  finden:  die \nAnstalt,  sehr  groß  angelegt,  um  ich  weiß  nicht  wie  viel \nPilger  zu  fassen,  sei  gegenwärtig  ziemlich  zusammen- \ngegangen, und  die  Einkünfte  würden  eben  anders  ver- \nwendet. \n\nSo  unterhalten,  waren  wir  die  schöne  Brenta  herunter- \ngekommen, manchen  herrlichen  Garten,  manchen  herr- \nlichen Palast  hinter  uns  lassend,  wohlhabende,  belebte \nOrtschaften  an  der  Küste  mit  flüchtigem  Blick  beschauend. \nAls  wir  nun  in  die  Lagunen  einfuhren,  umschwärmten \nmehrere  Gondeln  sogleich  das  SchiÖ\".  Ein  Lombard,  in \nVenedig  wohl  bekannt,  forderte  mich  auf,  ihm  Gesell- \nschaft zu  leisten,  damit  wir  geschwinder  drinne  wären \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  71 \n\nund  der  Doganenqual  entgingen.  Einige,  die  uns  ab- \nhalten wollten,  wußte  er  mit  einem  mäßigen  Trinkgeld \nzu  beseitigen,  und  so  schwammen  wir,  bei  einem  heitern \nSonnenuntergang,  schnell  unserm  Ziel  entgegen. \n\nDen  2g.  Septet?iber,  Michaelistag  abends. \nVon  Venedig  ist  schon  viel  erzählt  und  gedruckt,  daß  ich \nmit  Beschreibung  nicht  umständlich  sein  will;  ich  sage \nnur,  wie  es  mir  entgegenkömmt.  Was  sich  mir  aber  vor \nallem  andern  aufdringt,  ist  abermals  das  Volk,  eine  große \nMasse,  ein  notwendiges  unwillkürliches  Dasein. \nDieses  Geschlecht  hat  sich  nicht  zum  Spaß  auf  diese  In- \nseln geflüchtet;  es  war  keine  Willkür,  welche  die  Fol- \ngenden trieb,  sich  mit  ihnen  zu  vereinigen:  die  Not  lehrte \nsie  ihre  Sicherheit  in  der  unvorteilhaftesten  Lage  suchen, \ndie  ihnen  nachher  so  vorteilhaft  ward  und  sie  klug  machte, \nals  noch  die  ganze  nördliche  Welt  im  Düstern  gefangen \nlag;  ihre  Vermehrung,  ihr  Reichtum  war  notwendige \nFolge.  Nun  drängten  sich  die  Wohnungen  enger  und \nenger,  Sand  und  Sumpf  wurden  durch  Felsen  ersetzt; \ndie  Häuser  suchten  die  Luft,  wie  Bäume,  die  geschlossen \nstehen:  sie  mußten  an  Höhe  zu  gewinnen  suchen,  was \nihnen  an  Breite  abging.  Auf  jede  Spanne  des  Bodens \ngeizig  und  gleich  anfangs  in  enge  Räume  gedrängt,  ließen \nsie  zu  Gassen  nicht  mehr  Breite,  als  nötig  war,  eine \nHausreihe  von  der  gegenüberstehenden  zu  trennen  und \ndem  Bürger  notdürftige  Durchgänge  zu  erhalten.  Übri- \ngens war  ihnen  das  Wasser  statt  Straße,  Platz  und  Spa- \nziergang. Der  Venezianer  mußte  eine  neue  Art  von  Ge- \nschöpf werden,  wie  man  denn  auch  Venedig  nur  mit  sich \nselbst  vergleichen  kann.  Der  große  schlangenförmig  ge- \nwundene Kanal  weicht  keiner  Straße  in  der  Welt,  dem \nRaum  vor  dem  Markusplatze  kann  wohl  nichts  an  die \nSeite  gesetzt  werden:  ich  meine  den  großen  Wasserspiegel, \nder  diesseits  von  dem  eigentlichen  Venedig  im  halben \nMond  umfaßt  wird.  Über  der  Wasserfläche  sieht  man \nlinks  die  Insel  San  Giorgio  Maggiore,  etwas  weiter  rechts \ndie  Giudecca  und  ihren  Kanal,  noch  weiter  rechts  die \nDogane  und  die  Einfahrt  in  den  Canal  Grande,  wo  uns \n\n\n72  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngleich  ein  paar  ungeheure  Marmortempel  entgegenleuch- \nten. Dies  sind  mit  wenigen  Zügen  die  Hauptgegenstände, \ndie  uns  in  die  Augen  fallen,  wenn  wir  zwischen  den  zwei \nSäulen  des  Markusplatzes  hervortreten.  Die  sämtlichen \nAus-  und  Ansichten  sind  so  oft  in  Kupfer  gestochen,  daß \ndie  Freunde  davon  sich  gar  leicht  einen  anschaulichen \nBegriff  machen  können. \n\nNach  Tische  eilte  ich,  mir  erst  einen  Eindruck  des  Gan- \nzen zu  versichern,  und  warf  mich,  ohne  Begleiter,  nur \ndie  Himmelsgegenden  merkend,  ins  Labyrinth  der  Stadt, \nwelche,  obgleich  durchaus  von  Kanälen  und  Kanälchen \ndurchschnitten,  durch  Brücken  und  Brückchen  wieder  zu- \nsammenhängt. Die  Enge  und  Gedrängtheit  des  Ganzen \ndenkt  man  nicht,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben.  Gewöhnlich \nkann  man  die  Breite  der  Gasse  mit  ausgereckten  Armen \nentweder  ganz  oder  beinahe  messen,  in  den  engsten  stößt \nman  schon  mit  den  Ellbogen  an,  wenn  man  die  Hände \nin  die  Seite  stemmt;  es  gibt  wohl  breitere,  auch  hie  und \nda  ein  Plätzchen,  verhältnismäßig  aber  kann  alles  enge \ngenannt  werden. \n\nIch  fand  leicht  den  großen  Kanal  und  die  Hauptbrücke \nRialto;  sie  besteht  aus  einem  einzigen  Bogen  von  weißem \nMarmor.  Von  oben  herunter  ist  es  eine  große  Ansicht: \nder  Kanal  gesäet  voll  Schiffe,  die  alles  Bedürfnis  vom \nfesten  Lande  herbeiführen  und  hier  hauptsächlich  anlegen \nund  ausladen;  dazwischen  wimmelt  es  von  Gondeln.  Be- \nsonders heute,  als  am  Michaelisfeste,  gab  es  einen  An- \nblick wunderschön  lebendig;  doch  um  diesen  einiger- \nmaßen darzustellen,  muß  ich  etwas  weiter  ausholen. \nDie  beiden  Hauptteile  von  Venedig,  welche  der  große \nKanal  trennt,  werden  durch  die  einzige  Brücke  Rialto \nmiteinander  verbunden,  doch  ist  auch  für  mehrere  Kom- \nmunikation gesorgt,  welche,  in  offenen  Barken,  an  be- \nstimmten Überfahrtspunkten  geschieht.  Nun  sah  es  heute \nsehr  gut  aus,  als  die  wohlgekleideten,  doch  mit  einem \nschwarzen  Schleier  bedeckten  Frauen  sich,  viele  zusam- \nmen, übersetzen  ließen,  um  zu  der  Kirche  des  gefeierten \nErzengels  zu  gelangen.  Ich  verließ  die  Brücke  und  be- \ngab  mich  an  einen  solchen  Überfahrtspunkt,  die  Aus- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  73 \n\nsteigenden  genau  zu  betrachten.  Ich  habe  sehr  schöne \nGesichter  und  Gestalten  darunter  gefunden. \nNachdem  ich  müde  geworden,  setzte  ich  mich  in  eine \nGondel,  die  engen  Gassen  verlassend,  und  fuhr,  mir  das  ent- \ngegengesetzte Schauspiel  zu  bereiten,  den  nördlichen  Teil \ndes  großen  Kanals  durch,  um  die  Insel  der  heiligen  Klara, \nin  die  Lagunen,  den  Kanal  der  Giudecca  herein,  bis  ge- \ngen den  Markusplatz,  und  war  nun  auf  einmal  ein  Mit- \nherr des  Adriatischen  Meeres,  wie  jeder  Venezianer  sich \nfühlt,  wenn  er  sich  in  seine  Gondel  legt.  Ich  gedachte  dabei \nmeines  guten  Vaters  in  Ehren,  der  nichts  Besseres  wußte, \nals  von  diesen  Dingen  zu  erzählen.  Wird  mir's  nicht  auch \nso  gehen?  Alles,  was  mich  umgibt,  ist  würdig,  ein  großes \nrespektables  Werk  versammelter  Menschenkraft,  ein  herr- \nliches Monument,  nicht  eines  Gebieters,  sondern  eines \nVolks.  Und  wenn  auch  ihre  Lagunen  sich  nach  und  nach \nausfüllen,  böse  Dünste  über  dem  Sumpfe  schweben,  ihr \nHandel  geschwächt,  ihre  Macht  gesunken  ist,  so  wird \ndie  ganze  Anlage  der  Republik  und  ihr  Wesen  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  dem  Beobachter  weniger  ehrwürdig \nsein.  Sie  unterliegt  der  Zeit,  wie  alles,  was  ein  erschei- \nnendes Dasein  hat. \n\nDen  30.  September. \nGegen  Abend  verlief  ich  mich  wieder,  ohne  Führer,  in \ndie  entferntesten  Quartiere  der  Stadt.  Die  hiesigen  Brük- \nken  sind  alle  mit  Treppen  angelegt,  damit  Gondeln  und \nauch  wohl  größere  Schiffe  bequem  unter  den  Bogen  hin- \nfahren. Ich  suchte  mich  in  und  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \nzu  finden,  ohne  irgend  jemand  zu  fragen,  mich  abermals \nnur  nach  der  Himmelsgegend  richtend.  Man  entwirrt \nsich  wohl  endlich,  aber  es  ist  ein  unglaubliches  Gehecke \nineinander,  und  meine  Manier,  sich  recht  sinnlich  da- \nvon zu  überzeugen,  die  beste.  Auch  habe  ich  mir,  bis \nan  die  letzte  bewohnte  Spitze,  der  Einwohner  Betragen, \nLebensart,  Sitte  und  Wesen  gemerkt;  in  jedem  Quartiere \nsind  sie  anders  beschaffen.  Du  lieber  Gott!  was  doch \nder  Mensch  für  ein  armes,  gutes  Tier  ist! \nSehr  viele  Häuserchen  stehen  unmittelbar  in  den  Ka- \n\n\n74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nnälen;  doch  gibt  es  hie  und  da  schön  gepflasterte  Stein- \ndämnie,  auf  denen  man  zwischen  Wasser,  Kirchen  und \nPalästen  gar  angenehm  hin  und  wieder  spaziert.  Lustig \nund  erfreuhch  ist  der  lange  Steindamm  an  der  nördlichen \nSeite,  von  welchem  die  Inseln,  besonders  Murano,  das \nVenedig  im  kleinen,  geschaut  werden.  Die  Lagunen  da- \nzwischen sind  von  vielen  Gondeln  belebt. \n\nAbends. \nHeute  habe  ich  abermals  meinen  Begriff  von  Venedig \nerweitert,  indem  ich  mir  den  Plan  verschaffte.  Als  ich \nihn  einigermaßen  studiert,  bestieg  ich  den  Markusturm, \nwo  sich  dem  Auge  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  darstellt.  Es \nwar  um  Mittag  und  heller  Sonnenschein,  daß  ich  ohne \nPerspektiv  Nähen  und  Fernen  genau  erkennen  konnte. \nDie  Flut  bedeckte  die  Lagunen,  und  als  ich  den  Blick \nnach  dem  sogenannten  Lido  wandte — es  ist  ein  schmaler \nErdstreif,  der  die  Lagunen  schließt — sah  ich  zum  ersten- \nmal das  Meer  und  einige  Segel,  darauf.  In  den  Lagunen \nselbst  liegen  Galeeren  und  Fregatten,  die  zum  Ritter  Emo \nstoßen  sollten,  der  den  Algierern  den  Krieg  macht,  die \naber  wegen  ungünstiger  Winde  liegen  bleiben.  Die  Padu- \nanischen  und  Vicentinischen  Berge  und  das  Tiroler  Ge- \nbirge schließen,  zwischen  Abend  und  Mitternacht,  das \nBild  ganz  trefflich  schön. \n\nDen  I.  Oktober. \nIch  ging  und  besah  mir  die  Stadt  in  mancherlei  Rück- \nsichten, und  da  es  eben  Sonntag  war,  fiel  mir  die  große \nUnreinlichkeit  der  Straßen  auf,  worüber  ich  meine  Be- \ntrachtungen anstellen  mußte.  Es  ist  wohl  eine  Art  von \nPolizei  in  diesem  Artikel:  die  Leute  schieben  den  Keh- \nricht in  die  Ecken;  auch  sehe  ich  große  Schiffe  hin  und \nwieder  fahren,  die  an  manchen  Orten  stille  liegen  und \ndas  Kehricht  mitnehmen,  Leute  von  den  Inseln  umher, \nwelche  des  Düngers  bedürfen;  aber  es  ist  in  diesen  An- \nstalten weder  Folge  noch  Strenge  imd  desto  unverzeih- \nlicher die  Unreinlichkeit  der  Stadt,  da  sie  ganz  zur  Rein- \nlichkeit angelegt  worden,  so  gut  als  irgend  eine  hol- \nländische. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  75 \n\nAlle  Straßen  sind  geplattet,  selbst  die  entferntesten \nQuartiere  wenigstens  mit  Backsteinen  auf  der  hohen \nKante  ausgesetzt,  wo  es  nötig,  in  der  Mitte  ein  wenig \nerhaben,  an  der  Seite  Vertiefungen,  das  Wasser  aufzu- \nfassen und  in  bedeckte  Kanäle  zu  leiten.  Noch  andere \narchitektonische  Vorrichtungen  der  ersten  wohlüberdach- \nten Anlage  zeugen  von  der  Absicht  trefflicher  Baumeister, \nVenedig  zu  der  reinsten  Stadt  zu  machen,  wie  sie  die \nsonderbarste  ist.  Ich  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  gleich \nim  Spaziergehen  eine  Anordnung  deshalb  zu  entwerfen \nund  einem  Polizeivorsteher,  dem  es  Ernst  wäre,  in  Ge- \ndanken vorzuarbeiten.  So  hat  man  immer  Trieb  und  Lust, \nvor  fremden  Türen  zu  kehren. \n\nDen  2.  Oktober. \nVor  allem  eilte  ich  in  die  Caritä:  ich  hatte  in  des  Pal- \nladio  Werken  gefunden,  daß  er  hier  ein  Klostergebäude \nangegeben,  in  welchem  er  die  Privatwohnung  der  reichen \nund  gastfreien  Alten  darzustellen  gedachte.  Der  sowohl \nim  ganzen  als  in  seinen  einzelnen  Teilen  trefflich  ge- \nzeichnete Plan  machte  mir  unendliche  Freude,  und  ich \nhofi'te  ein  Wunderwerk  zu  finden;  aber  ach!  es  ist  kaum \nder  zehnte  Teil  ausgeführt;  doch  auch  dieser  Teil  seines \nhimmlischen  Genius  würdig,  eine  Vollkommenheit  in  der \nAnlage  und  eine  Genauigkeit  in  der  Ausführung,  die  ich \nnoch  nicht  kannte.  Jahrelang  sollte  man  in  Betrachtung \nso  eines  Werks  zubringen.  Mich  dünkt,  ich  habe  nichts \nHöheres,  nichts  Vollkommneres  gesehen,  und  glaube,  daß \nich  mich  nicht  irre.  Denke  man  sich  aber  auch  den \ntrefflichen  Künstler,  mit  dem  Innern  Sinn  fürs  Große \nund  Gefällige  geboren,  der  erst  mit  unglaublicher  Mühe \nsich  an  den  Alten  heranbildet,  um  sie  alsdann  durch  sich \nwiederherzustellen.  Dieser  findet  Gelegenheit,  einen  Lieb- \nlingsgedanken auszuführen,  ein  Kloster,  so  vielen  Mön- \nchen zur  Wohnung,  so  vielen  Fremden  zur  Herberge \nbestimmt,  nach  der  Form  eines  antiken  Privatgebäudes \naufzurichten. \n\nDie  Kirche  stand  schon;  aus  ihr  tritt  man  in  ein  Atrium \nvon  korinthischen  Säulen,  man  ist  entzückt  und  vergißt \n\n\n76  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  einmal  alles  Pfaffentum.  An  der  einen  Seite  findet \nman  die  Sakristei,  an  der  andern  ein  Kapitelzimmer, \ndaneben  die  schönste  Wendeltreppe  von  der  Welt,  mit \noffener  weiter  Spindel,  die  steinernen  Stufen  in  die  Wand \ngemauert  und  so  geschichtet,  daß  eine  die  andere  trägt; \nman  wird  nicht  müde,  sie  auf  und  ab  zu  steigen;  wie \nschön  sie  geraten  sei,  kann  man  daraus  abnehmen,  daß \nsie  Palladio  selbst  für  wohlgeraten  angibt.  Aus  dem  Vor- \nhof tritt  man  in  den  innern  großen  Hof.  Von  dem  Ge- \nbäude, das  ihn  umgeben  sollte,  ist  leider  nur  die  linke \nSeite  aufgeführt,  drei  Säulenordnungen  übereinander,  auf \nder  Erde  Hallen,  im  ersten  Stock  ein  Bogengang  vor  den \nZellen  hin,  der  obere  Stock  Mauer  mit  Fenstern.  Doch \ndiese  Beschreibung  muß  durch  den  Anblick  der  Risse  ge- \nstärkt werden.  Nun  ein  Wort  von  der  Ausführung. \nNur  die  Häupter  und  Füße  der  Säulen  und  die  Schluß- \nsteine der  Bogen  sind  von  gehauenem  Stein,  das  übrige \nalles,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  von  Backsteinen,  sondern  von \ngebranntem  Ton.  Solche  Ziegeln  kenne  ich  gar  nicht. \nFries  und  Karnies  sind  auch  daraus,  die  Glieder  der  Bo- \ngen gleichfalls,  alles  teilweise  gebrannt  und  das  Gebäude \nzuletzt  nur  mit  wenig  Kalk  zusammengesetzt.  Es  steht \nwie  aus  einem  Guß.  'Wäre  das  Ganze  fertig  geworden \nund  man  sähe  es  reinlich  abgerieben  und  gefärbt,  es \nmüßte  ein  himmlischer  Anblick  sein. \nJedoch  die  Anlage  war  zu  groß,  wie  bei  so  manchem  Gebäude \nder  neuern  Zeit.  Der  Künstler  hatte  nicht  nur  vorausge- \nsetzt, daß  man  das  jetzige  Kloster  abreißen,  sondern  auch \nanstoßende  Nachbarshäuser  kaufen  werde;  und  da  mögen \nGeld  und  Lust  ausgegangen  sein.  Du  liebes  Schicksal,  das \ndu  so  manche  Dummheit  begünstigt  und  verewigt  hast, \nwarum  ließest  du  dieses  Werk  nicht  zustande  kommen! \n\nDen  s-  Oktober. \nDie  Kirche  II  Redentore,  ein  schönes  großes  Werk  von \nPalladio,  die  Fassade  lobenswürdiger  als  die  von  San \nGiorgio.  Diese  mehrmals  in  Kupfer  gestochenen  Werke \nmüßte  man  vor  sich  sehen,  um  das  Gesagte  verdeutlichen \nzu  können.    Hier  nur  wenige  Worte. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  77 \n\nPalladio  war  durchaus  von  der  Existenz  der  Alten  durch- \ndrungen und  fühlte  die  Kleinheit  und  Enge  seiner  Zeit \nwie  ein  großer  Mensch,  der  sich  nicht  hingeben,  sondern \ndas  übrige  so  viel  als  möglich  nach  seinen  edlen  Be- \ngrifien  umbilden  will.  Er  war  unzufrieden,  wie  ich  aus \ngelinder  Wendung  seines  Buches  schließe,  daß  man  bei \nchristlichen  Kirchen  nach  der  Form  der  alten  Basiliken \nzu  bauen  fortfahre:  er  suchte  deshalb  seine  heiligen  Ge- \nbäude der  alten  Tempelform  zu  nähern;  daher  ent- \nstanden gewisse  Unschicklichkeiten,  die  mir  bei  II  Reden- \ntore glücklich  beseitigt,  bei  San  Giorgio  aber  zu  auffallend \nerscheinen.  Volkmann  sagt  etwas  davon,  trifft  aber  den \nNagel  nicht  auf  den  Kopf. \n\nInwendig  ist  II  Redentore  gleichfalls  köstlich,  alles,  auch \ndie  Zeichnung  der  Altäre,  von  Palladio;  leider  die  Ni- \nschen, die  mit  Statuen  ausgefüllt  werden  sollten,  prangen \nmit  flachen,  ausgeschnittenen,  gemalten  Brettfiguren. \n\nDem  heiligen  Franziskus  zu  Ehren  hatten  die  Patres \nKapuziner  einen  Seitenaltar  mächtig  ausgeputzt:  man \nsah  nichts  von  Stein  als  die  korinthischen  Kapitale; \nalles  übrige  schien  mit  einer  geschmackvollen  prächtigen \nStickerei,  nach  Art  der  Arabesken,  überzogen,  und  zwar \nso  artig,  als  man  nur  etwas  zu  sehen  wünschte.  Beson- \nders wunderte  ich  mich  über  die  breiten,  goldgestickten \nRanken  und  Laubwerke.  Ich  ging  näher  und  fand  einen \nrecht  hübschen  Betrug.  Alles,  was  ich  für  Gold  gehalten \nhatte^  war  breitgedrücktes  Stroh,  nach  schönen  Zeich- \nnungen auf  Papier  geklebt,  der  Grund  mit  lebhaften  Far- \nben angestrichen,  und  das  so  mannigfaltig  und  ge- \nschmackvoll, daß  dieser  Spaß,  dessen  Material  gar  nichts \nwert  war  und  der  wahrscheinlich  im  Kloster  selbst  aus- \ngeführt wurde,  mehrere  tausend  Taler  müßte  gekostet \nhaben,  wenn  er  echt  hätte  sein  sollen.  Man  könnte  es \ngelegentlich  wohl  nachahmen. \n\nAuf  einem  Uferdamme,  im  Angesicht  des  Wassers,  be- \nmerkte ich  schon  einigemal  einen  geringen  Kerl,  welcher \neiner  größern  oder  kleinern  Anzahl  von  Zuhörern  im \nvenezianischen  Dialekt   Geschichten  erzählte;  ich  kann \n\n\n78  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nleider  nichts  davon  verstehen;  es  lacht  aber  kein  Mensch, \nnur  selten  lächelt  das  Auditorium,  das  meist  aus  der  ganz \nniedern  Klasse  besteht.  Auch  hat  der  Mann  nichts  Auf- \nfallendes noch  Lächerliches  in  seiner  Art,  vielmehr  et- \nwas sehr  Gesetztes,  zugleich  eine  bewundrungswürdige \nMannigfaltigkeit  und  Präzision,  welche  auf  Kunst  und \nNachdenken  hinwiesen,  in  seinen  Gebärden. \n\nDen  Plan  in  der  Hand,  suchte  ich  mich  durch  die  wunder- \nlichsten Irrgänge  bis  zur  Kirche  der  Mendicanti  zu  finden. \nHier  ist  das  Konservatorium,  welches  gegenwärtig  den \nmeisten  Beifall  hat.  Die  Frauenzimmer  fühj-ten  ein  Ora- \ntorium hinter  dem  Gitter  auf,  die  Kirche  war  voll  Zu- \nhörer, die  Musik  sehr  schön,  und  herrliche  Stimmen.  Ein \nAlt  sang  den  König  Saul,  die  Hauptperson  des  Gedichtes. \nVon  einer  solchen  Stimme  hatte  ich  gar  keinen  Begriff; \neinige  Stellen  der  Musik  waren  unendlich  schön,  der  Text \nvollkommen  singbar,  so  italienisch  Latein,  daß  man  an \nmanchen  Stellen  lachen  muß;  die  Musik  aber  findet  hier \nein  weites  Feld. \n\nEs  wäre  ein  trefflicher  Genuß  gewesen,  wenn  nicht  der \nvermaledeite  Kapellmeister  den  Takt  mit  einer  Rolle \nNoten  wider  das  Gitter  und  so  unverschämt  geklappt \nhätte,  als  habe  er  mit  Schuljungen  zu  tun,  die  er  eben \nunterrichtete;  und  die  Mädchen  hatten  das  Stück  oft \nwiederholt,  sein  Klatschen  war  ganz  unnötig  und  zerstörte \nallen  Eindruck,  nicht  anders  als  wenn  einer,  um  uns  eine \nschöne  Statue  begreiflich  zu  machen,  ihr  Scharlachläpp- \nchen auf  die  Gelenke  klebte.  Der  fremde  Schall  hebt  alle \nHarmonie  auf.  Das  ist  nun  ein  Musiker,  und  er  hört  es  nicht, \noder  er  will  vielmehr,  daß  man  seine  Gegenwart  durch \neine  Unschicklichkeit  vernehmen  soll,  da  es  besser  wäre, \ner  ließe  seinen  Wert  an  der  Vollkommenheit  der  Ausführung \nerraten.  Ich  weiß,  die  Franzosen  haben  es  an  der  Art; \nden  Italienern  hätte  ich  es  nicht  zugetraut,  und  das  Publi- \nkum scheint  daran  gewöhnt.  Es  ist  nicht  das  einzige  Mal, \ndaß  es  sich  einbilden  läßt,  das  gerade  gehöre  zum  Genuß, \nwas  den  Genuß  verdirbt. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  79 \n\nGestern  abend  Oper  zu  St.  Moses  (denn  die  Theater  haben \nihren  Namen  von  der  Kirche,  der  sie  am  nächsten  liegen); \nnicht  recht  erfreuUch!  Es  fehlt  dem  Poem,  der  Musik, \nden  Sängern  eine  innere  Energie,  welche  allein  eine  solche \nDarstellung  auf  den  höchsten  Punkt  treiben  kann.  Man \nkonnte  von  keinem  Teile  sagen,  er  sei  schlecht;  aber  nur \ndie  zwei  Frauen  ließen  sich's  angelegen  sein,  nicht  so- \nwohl gut  zu  agieren  als  sich  zu  produzieren  und  zu  ge- \nfallen. Das  ist  denn  immer  etwas.  Es  sind  zwei  schöne \nFiguren,  gute  Stimmen,  artige,  muntere,  gätliche  Per- \nsönchen.  Unter  den  Männern  dagegen  keine  Spur  von \ninnerer  Gewalt  und  Lust,  dem  Publikum  etwas  aufzuheften, \nsowie  keine  entschieden  glänzende  Stimme. \nDas  Ballett,  von  elender  Erfindung,  ward  im  ganzen  aus- \ngepfififen,  einige  treöliche  Springer  und  Springerinnen \njedoch,  welche  letztere  sich  es  zur  Pflicht  rechneten,  die \nZuschauer  mit  jedem  schönen  Teil  ihres  Körpers  bekannt \nzu  machen,  wurden  weidlich  beklatscht. \n\nHeute  dagegen  sah  ich  eine  andere  Komödie,  die  mich \nmehr  gefreut  hat.  Im  herzoglichen  Palast  hörte  ich  eine \nRechtssache  öfientlich  verhandeln;  sie  war  wichtig  und \nzu  meinem  Glück  in  den  Ferien  vorgenommen.  Der  eine \nAdvokat  war  aUes,  was  ein  übertriebener  BufFo  nur  sein \nsollte.  Figur  dick,  kurz,  doch  beweglich,  ein  ungeheuer \nvorspringendes  Profil,  eine  Stimme  wie  Erz  und  eine \nHeftigkeit,  als  wenn  es  ihm  aus  tiefstem  Grunde  des \nHerzens  Ernst  wäre,  was  er  sagte.  Ich  nenne  dies  eine \nKomödie,  weil  alles  wahrscheinlich  schon  fertig  ist,  wenn \ndiese  öffentliche  Darstellung  geschieht:  die  Richter  wissen, \nwas  sie  sprechen  sollen,  und  die  Partei  weiß,  was  sie  zu \nerwarten  hat.  Indessen  gefällt  mir  diese  Art  unendlich \nbesser  als  unsere  Stuben-  und  Kanzleihockereien.  Und \nnun  von  den  Umständen,  und  wie  artig,  ohne  Prunk,  wie \nnatürlich  alles  zugeht,  will  ich  suchen  einen  Begriff  zu \ngeben. \n\nIn  einem  geräumigen  Saal  des  Palastes  saßen  an  der  einen \nSeite  die  Richter  im  Halbzirkel.  Gegen  ihnen  über,  auf \neinem  Katheder,  der  mehrere  Personen  nebeneinander \n\n\n8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfassen  konnte,  die  Advokaten  beider  Parteien;  unmittel- \nbar vor  demselben,  auf  ei7:er  Bank,  Kläger  und  Beklagte \nin  eigner  Person.  Der  Advokat  des  Klägers  war  von  dem \nKatheder  herabgestiegen,  denn  die  heutige  Sitzung  war \nzu  keiner  Kontrovers  bestimmt.  Die  sämtlichen  Doku- \nmente für  und  wider,  obgleich  schon  gedruckt,  sollten \nvorgelesen  werden. \n\nEin  hagerer  Schreiber,  in  schwarzem  kümmerlichen  Rocke, \nein  dickes  Heft  in  der  Hand,  bereitete  sich,  die  Pflicht \ndes  Lesenden  zu  erfüllen.  Von  Zuschauern  und  Zuhörern \nwar  übrigens  der  Saal  gedrängt  voll.  Die  Rechtsfrage \nselbst  sowie  die  Personen,  welche  sie  betraf,  mußten  den \nVenezianern  höchst  bedeutend  scheinen. \nFideikommisse  haben  in  diesem  Staat  die  entschiedenste \nGunst:  ein  Besitztum,  welchem  einmal  dieser  Charakter \naufgeprägt  ist,  behält  ihn  für  ewige  Zeiten;  es  mag  durch \nirgend  eine  Wendung  oder  Umstand  vor  mehrern  hundert \nJahren  veräußert  worden,  durch  viele  Hände  gegangen \nsein,  zuletzt,  wenn  die  Sache  zur  Sprache  kommt,  be- \nhalten die  Nachkommen  der  ersten  Familie  recht,  und \ndie  Güter  müssen  herausgegeben  werden. \nDiesmal  war  der  Streit  höchst  wichtig,  denn  die  Klage \nging  gegen  den  Doge  selbst  oder  vielmehr  gegen  seine \nGemahlin,  welche  denn  auch  in  Person  auf  dem  Bänkchen, \nvom  Kläger  nur  durch  einen  kleinen  Zwischenraum  ge- \ntrennt, in  ihren  Zendal  gehüllt  dasaß.  Eine  Dame  von \ngewissem  Alter,  edlem  Körperbau,  wohlgebildetem  Ge- \nsicht, auf  welchem  ernste,  ja  wenn  man  will  etwas  ver- \ndrießliche Züge  zu  sehen  waren.  Die  Venezianer  bildeten \nsich  viel  darauf  ein,  daß  die  Fürstin,  in  ilirera  eignen \nPalast,  vor  dem  Gericht  und  ihnen  erscheinen  müsse. \nDer  Schreiber  fing  zu  lesen  an,  und  nun  ward  mir  erst \ndeutlich,  was  ein  im  Angesicht  der  Richter,  unfern  des \nKatheders  der  Advokaten,  hinter  einem  kleinen  Tische \nauf  einem  niedern  Schemel  sitzendes  Männchen,  besonders \naber  die  Sanduhr  bedeute,  die  er  vor  sich  niedergelegt \nhatte.  Solange  nämlich  der  Schreiber  liest,  so  lange \nläuft  die  Zeit  nicht;  dem  Advokaten  aber,  wenn  er  dabei \nsprechen  will,  ist  nur  im  ganzen  eine  gewisse  Frist  ge- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  81 \n\ngönnt.  Der  Schreiber  liest,  die  Uhr  liegt,  das  Männchen \nhat  die  Hand  daran.  Tut  der  Advokat  den  Mund  auf,  so \nsteht  auch  die  Uhr  schon  in  der  Höhe,  die  sich  sogleich \nniedersenkt,  sobald  er  schweigt.  Hier  ist  nun  die  große \nKunst,  in  den  Fluß  der  Vorlesung  hineinzureden,  flüchtige \nBemerkungen  zu  machen,  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  erregen  und \nzu  fordern.  Nun  kommt  der  kleine  Saturn  in  die  größte \nVerlegenheit.  Er  ist  genötigt,  den  horizontalen  und  ver- \ntikalen Stand  der  Uhr  jeden  Augenblick  zu  verändern,  er \nbefindet  sich  im  Fall  der  bösen  Geister  im  Puppenspiel, \ndie  auf  das  schnell  wechselnde  Berlicke!  Berlocke!  des \nmutwilligen  Hanswursts  nicht  wissen,  wie  sie  gehen  oder \nkommen  sollen. \n\nWer  in  Kanzleien  hat  kollationieren  hören,  kann  sich  eine \nVorstellung  von  dieser  Vorlesung  machen,  schnell,  ein- \ntönig, aber  doch  artikuliert  und  deutlich  genug.  Der \nkunstreiche  Advokat  weiß  nun  durch  Scherze  die  Lange- \nweile zu  unterbrechen,  und  das  Publikum  ergötzt  sich  an \nseinen  Spaßen  in  ganz  unmäßigem  Gelächter.  Eines \nScherzes  muß  ich  gedenken,  des  auffallendsten  unter \ndenen,  die  ich  verstand.  Der  Vorleser  rezitierte  soeben \nein  Dokument,  wodurch  einer  jener  unrechtmäßig  ge- \nachteten Besitzer  über  die  fraglichen  Güter  disponierte. \nDer  Advokat  hieß  ihn  langsamer  lesen,  und  als  er  die \nWorte  deutlich  aussprach:  Ich  schenke^  ich  vermache^  fuhr \nder  Redner  heftig  auf  den  Schreiber  los  und  rief:  Was \nwillst  du  schenken?  was  vermachen?  du  armer  ausge- \nhungerter Teufel!  Gehört  dir  doch  gar  nichts  in  der  Welt \nan.  Doch,  fuhr  er  fort,  indem  er  sich  zu  besinnen  schien, \nwar  doch  jener  erlauchte  Besitzer  in  eben  dem  Fall,  er \nwollte  schenken,  wollte  vermachen,  was  ihm  so  wenig \ngehörte  als  dir.  Ein  unendlich  Gelächter  schlug  auf,  doch \nsogleich  nahm  die  Sanduhr* die  horizontale  Lage  wieder \nan.  Der  Vorleser  summte  fort,  machte  dem  Advokaten  ein \nflämisch  Gesicht;  doch  das  sind  alles  verabredete  Spaße. \n\nDen  4.  Oktober. \nGestern  war  ich  in  der  Komödie,  Theater  St.  Lukas,  die \nmir  viel  Freude  gemacht  hat:  ich  sah  ein  extemporiertes \n\nGOETHE  IV  6 \n\n\n82  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nStück  in  Masken,  mit  viel  Naturell,  Energie  und  Bravour \naufgeführt.  Freilich  sind  sie  nicht  alle  gleich;  der  Pan- \ntalon  sehr  brav,  die  eine  Frau,  stark  und  wohlgebaut, \nkeine  außerordentliche  Schauspielerin,  spricht  exzellent \nund  weiß  sich  zu  betragen.  Ein  tolles  Sujet,  demjenigen \nähnlich,  das  bei  uns  unter  dem  Titel  ''Der  Verschlag''  be- \nhandelt ist.  Mit  unglaublicher  Abwechslung  unterhielt  es \nmehr  als  drei  Stunden.  Doch  ist  auch  hier  das  Volk \nwieder  die  Base,  worauf  dies  alles  ruht:  die  Zuschauer \nspielen  mit,  und  die  Menge  verschmilzt  mit  dem  Theater \nin  ein  Ganzes.  Den  Tag  über  auf  dem  Platz  und  am \nUfer,  auf  den  Gondeln  und  im  Palast,  der  Käufer  und \nVerkäufer,  der  Bettler,  der  Schiffer,  die  Nachbarin,  der \nAdvokat  und  sein  Gegner,  alles  lebt  und  treibt  und  läßt \nsich  es  angelegen  sein,  spricht  und  beteuert,  schreit  und \nbietet  aus,  singt  und  spielt,  flucht  und  lärmt.  Und  abends \ngehen  sie  ins  Theater  und  sehen  und  hören  das  Leben \nihres  Tages,  künstlich  zusammengestellt,  artiger  aufge- \nstutzt, mit  Märchen  durchflochten,  durch  Masken  von  der \nWirklichkeit  abgerückt,  durch  Sitten  genähert.  Hierüber \nfreun  sie  sich  kindisch,  schreien  wieder,  klatschen  und \nlärmen.  Von  Nacht  zu  Nacht,  ja  von  Mitternacht  zu \nMitternacht  ist  immer  alles  eben  dasselbe. \nIch  habe  aber  auch  nicht  leicht  natürlicher  agieren  sehen \nals  jene  Masken,  so  wie  es  nur  bei  einem  ausgezeichnet \nglücklichen  Naturell  durch  längere  Übung  erreicht  werden \nkami. \n\nDa  ich  das  schreibe,  machen  sie  einen  gewaltigen  T^ärm \nauf  dem  Kanal  unter  meinem  Fenster,  und  Mitternacht  ist \nvorbei.  Sie  haben  im  Guten  und  Bösen  immer  etwas  zu- \nsammen. \n\nÖffentliche  Redner  habe  ich  nun  gehört:  drei  Kerls  auf \ndem  Platze  und  Ufersteindamme,  jeden  nach  seiner  Art \nGeschichten  erzählend,  sodann  zwei  Sachwalter,  zwei \nPrediger,  die  Schauspieler,  worunter  ich  besonders  den \nPantalon  rühmen  muß;  alle  diese  haben  etwas  Gemein- \nsames, sowohl  weil  sie  von  ein  und  derselben  Nation  sind, \ndie,  stets  öftentlich  lebend,  immer  in  leidenschaftlichem \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  83 \n\nSprechen  begriffen  ist,  als  auch  weil  sie  sich  untereinander \nnachahmen.  Hierzu  kommt  noch  eine  entschiedene  Ge- \nbärdensprache, mit  welcher  sie  die  Ausdrücke  ihrer  Inten- \ntionen, Gesinnungen  und  Empfindungen  begleiten. \nHeute  am  Fest  des  heiligen  Franziskus  war  ich  in  seiner \nKirche  alle  Vigne.  Des  Kapuziners  laute  Stimme  ward \nvon  dem  Geschrei  der  Verkäufer  vor  der  Kirche  wie  von \neiner  Antiphone  begleitet;  ich  stand  in  der  Kirchtüre \nzwischen  beiden,  und  es  war  wunderlich  genug  zu  hören. \n\nDen  j.  Oktober. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  im  Arsenal,  mir  immer  interessant \ngenug,  da  ich  noch  kein  Seewesen  kenne  und  hier  die \nuntere  Schule  besuchte:  denn  freilich  sieht  es  hier  nach \neiner  alten  Familie  aus,  die  sich  noch  rührt,  obgleich  die \nbeste  Zeit  der  Blüte  und  der  Früchte  vorüber  ist.  Da  ich \ndenn  auch  den  Handwerkern  nachgehe,  habe  ich  manches \nMerkwürdige  gesehen  und  ein  Schiff  von  vierundachtzig \nKanonen,  dessen  Gerippe  fertig  steht,  bestiegen. \nEin  gleiches  ist  vor  sechs  Monaten,  an  der  Riva  de' \nSchiavoni,  bis  aufs  Wasser  verbrannt;  die  Pulverkammer \nwar  nicht  sehr  gefüllt,  und  da  sie  sprang,  tat  es  keinen \ngroßen  Schaden.  Die  benachbarten  Häuser  büßten  ihre \nScheiben  ein. \n\nDas  schönste  Eichenholz,  aus  Istrien,  habe  ich  verarbeiten \nsehen  und  dabei  über  den  Wachstum  dieses  werten  Baumes \nmeine  stillen  Betrachtungen  angestellt.  Ich  kann  nicht \ngenug  sagen,  was  meine  sauer  erworbene  Kenntnis  natür- \nlicher Dinge,  die  doch  der  Mensch  zuletzt  als  Materialien \nbraucht  und  in  seinen  Nutzen  verwendet,  mir  überall  hilft, \num  mir  das  Verfahren  der  Künstler  und  Handwerker  zu \nerklären;  so  ist  mir  auch  die  Kenntnis  der  Gebirge  und \ndes  daraus  genommenen  Gesteins  ein  großer  Vorsprung \nin  der  Kunst. \n\nUm  mit  einem  Worte  den  Begriff  des  Bucentaur  auszu- \nsprechen, nenne  ich  ihn  eine  Prachtgaleere.  Der  ältere, \nvon  dem  wir  noch  Abbildungen  haben,  rechtfertigt  diese \n\n\n84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nBenennung  noch  mehr  als  der  gegenwärtige,  der  uns  durch \nseinen  Glanz  über  seinen  Ursprung  verblendet. \nIch  komme  immer  auf  mein  Altes  zurück.  Wenn  dem \nKünstler  ein  echter  Gegenstand  gegeben  ist,  so  kann  er \netwas  Echtes  leisten.  Hier  war  ihm  aufgetragen,  eine \nGaleere  zu  bilden,  die  wert  wäre,  die  Häupter  der  Repu- \nblik, am  feierlichsten  Tage,  zum  Sakrament  ihrer  herge- \nbrachten Meerherrschaft  zu  tragen,  und  diese  Aufgabe  ist \nfürtreft'lich  au.sgeführt.  Das  Schiff  ist  ganz  Zierat,  also \ndarf  man  nicht  sagen:  mit  Zierat  überladen;  ganz  ver- \nguldetes  Schnitzwerk,  sonst  zu  keinem  Gebrauch,  eine \nwahre  Monstranz,  um  dem  Volke  seine  Häupter  recht \nherrlich  zu  zeigen.  Wissen  wir  doch:  das  Volk,  wie  es \ngern  seine  Hüte  schmückt,  will  auch  seine  Obern  prächtig \nund  geputzt  sehen.  Dieses  Prunkschiff  ist  ein  rechtes  In- \nventarienstück,  woran  man  sehen  kann,  was  die  Vene- \nzianer waren  und  sich  zu  sein  dünkten. \n\nNac/its. \nIch  komme  noch  lachend  aus  der  Tragödie  und  muß \ndiesen  Scherz  gleich  auf  dem  Papier  befestigen.  Das \nStück  war  nicht  schlimm,  der  Verfasser  hatte  alle  tragischen \nMatadore  zusammengesteckt,  und  die  Schauspieler  hatten \ngut  spielen.  Die  meisten  Situationen  waren  bekannt, \neinige  neu  und  ganz  glücklich.  Zwei  Väter,  die  sich  hassen. \nSöhne  und  Töchter  aus  diesen  getrennten  Familien,  leiden- \nschaftlich übers  Kreuz  verliebt,  ja  das  eine  Paar  heimUch \nverheiratet.  Es  ging  wild  und  grausam  zu,  und  nichts \nblieb  zuletzt  übrig,  um  die  jungen  Leute  glücklich  zu \nmachen,  als  daß  die  beiden  Väter  sich  erstachen,  worauf \nunter  lebhaftem  Händeklatschen  der  Vorhang  fiel.  Nun \nward  aber  das  Klatschen  heftiger,  nun  wurde  Fuora  ge- \nrufen, und  das  so  lange,  bis  sich  die  zwei  Hauptpaare \nbequemten,  hinter  dem  Vorhang  hervorzukriechen,  ihre \nl)ücklinge  zu  machen  und  auf  der  andern  Seite  wieder  ab- \nzugehen. \n\nDas  Publikum  war  noch  nicht  befriedigt,  es  klatschte  fort \nund  rief  I  morti!  Das  dauerte  so  lange,  bis  die  zwei \nToten  auch  herauskamen  und  sich  bückten,  da  denn  einige \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  85 \n\nStimmen  riefen  Bravi  i  morti!  Sie  wurden  durch  Klatschen \nlange  festgehalten,  bis  man  ihnen  gleichfalls  endlich  ab- \nzugehen erlaubte.  Diese  Posse  gewinnt  für  den  Augen- \nund  Ohrenzeugen  unendlich,  der  das  Bravo!  Bravi!  das \ndie  Italiener  immer  im  Munde  führen,  so  in  den  Ohren \nhat  wie  ich,  und  dann  auf  einmal  auch  die  Toten  mit \ndiesem  Ehrenwort  anrufen  hört. \n\nGute  Nacht!  so  können  wir  Nordländer  zu  jeder  Stunde \nsagen,  wenn  wir  im  Finstern  scheiden;  der  Italiener  sagt \nFelicissima  notte!  nur  einmal,  und  zwar  wenn  das  Licht \nin  das  Zimmer  gebracht  wird,  indem  Tag  und  Nacht  sich \nscheiden,  und  da  heißt  es  denn  etwas  ganz  anderes.  So \nunübersetzlich  sind  die  Eigenheiten  jeder  Sprache:  denn \nvom  höchsten  bis  zum  tiefsten  Wort  bezieht  sich  alles \nauf  Eigentümlichkeiten  der  Nation,  es  sei  nun  in  Cha- \nrakter, Gesinnungen  oder  Zuständen. \n\nDc7i  6.  Oktober. \nDie  Tragödie  gestern  hat  mich  manches  gelehrt.  Erst- \nlich habe  ich  gehört,  wie  die  Italiener  ihre  eilfsilbigen \nJamben  behandeln  und  deklamieren;  dann  habe  ich  be- \ngriffen, wie  klug  Gozzi  die  Masken  mit  den  tragischen \nFiguren  verbunden  hat.  Das  ist  das  eigentliche  Schau- \nspiel für  dieses  Volk:  denn  es  will  auf  eine  krude  Weise \ngerührt  sein,  es  nimmt  keinen  innigen,  zärtlichen  Anteil \nam  Unglücklichen,  es  freut  sie  nur,  wenn  der  Held  gut \nspricht;  denn  aufs  Reden  halten  sie  viel,  sodann  aber \nwollen  sie  lachen  oder  etwas  Albernes  vornehmen. \nIhr  Anteil  am  Schauspiel  ist  nur  als  an  einem  Wirklichen. \nDa  der  Tyrann  seinem  Sohne  das  Schwert  reichte  und \nforderte,  daß  dieser  seine  eigne  gegenüberstehende  Ge- \nmahlin umbringen  sollte,  fing  das  Volk  laut  an,  sein  Miß- \nvergnügen über  diese  Zumutung  zu  beweisen,  und  es \nfehlte  nicht  viel,  so  wäre  das  Stück  unterbrochen  worden. \nSie  verlangten,  der  Alte  sollte  sein  Schwert  zurückneh- \nmen, wodurch  denn  freilich  die  folgenden  Situationen \ndes  Stücks  wären  aufgehoben  worden.  Endlich  entschloß \nsich  der  bedrängte  Sohn,  trat  ins  Proszenium  und  bat \ndemütig,   sie  möchten  sich  nur  noch  einen  Augenblick \n\n\n86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngedulden,  die  Sache  werde  noch  ganz  nach  Wunsch  ab- \nlaufen. Künstlerisch  genommen  aber  war  diese  Situation \nnach  den  Umständen  albern  und  unnatürlich,  und  ich  lobte \ndas  Volk  um  sein  Gefühl. \n\nJetzt  verstehe  ich  besser  die  langen  Reden  und  das  viele \nHin-  und  Herdissertieren  im  griechischen  Trauerspiele. \nDie  Athenienser  hörten  noch  lieber  reden  und  verstanden \nsich  noch  besser  darauf  als  die  Italiener;  vor  den  Ge- \nrichtsstellen, wo  sie  den  ganzen  Tag  lagen,  lernten  sie \nschon  etwas. \n\nAn  den  ausgeführten  Werken  Palladios,  besonders  an \nden  Kirchen,  habe  ich  manches  Tadelnswürdige  neben \ndem  Köstlichsten  gefunden.  Wenn  ich  nun  so  bei  mir \nüberlegte,  inwiefern  ich  recht  oder  unrecht  hätte  gegen \neinen  solchen  außerordentlichen  Mann,  so  war  es,  als  ob \ner  dabei  stünde  und  mir  sagte:  das  und  das  habe  ich \nwider  Willen  gemacht,  aber  doch  gemacht,  weil  ich  unter \nden  gegebenen  Umständen  nur  auf  diese  Weise  meiner \nhöchsten  Idee  am  näch.sten  kommen  konnte. \nMir  scheint,  soviel  ich  auch  darüber  denke,  er  habe  bei \nBetrachtung  der  Höhe  und  Breite  einer  schon  bestehenden \nKirche,  eines  altern  Hauses,  wozu  er  Fassaden  errichten \nsollte,  nur  überlegt:  wie  gibst  du  diesen  Räumen  die \ngrößte  Form.-  im  einzelnen  mußt  du,  wegen  eintretenden \nBedürfnisses,  etwas  verrücken  oder  verpfuschen,  da  oder \ndort  wird  eine  Unschicklichkeit  entstehen;  aber  das \nmag  sein,  das  Ganze  wird  einen  hohen  Stil  haben,  und \ndu  wirst  dir  zur  Freude  arbeiten. \n\nUnd  so  hat  er  das  größte  Bild,  das  er  in  der  Seele  trug, \nauch  dahin  gebracht,  wo  es  nicht  ganz  paßte,  wo  er  es \nim  einzelnen  zerknittern  und  verstümmeln  mußte. \nDer  Flügel  in  der  Caritä  dagegen  muß  uns  deshalb  von \nso  hohem  Werte  sein,  weil  der  Künstler  freie  Hand  hatte \nund  seinem  Geist  unbedingt  folgen  durfte.  Wäre  das \nKloster  fertig  geworden,  so  stünde  vielleicht  in  der  ganzen \ngegenwärtigen  Welt  kein  vollkommneres  Werk  der  Bau- \nkunst. \nWie  er  gedacht  und  wie  er  gearbeitet,  wird  mir  immer \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  87 \n\nklarer,  je  mehr  ich  seine  Werke  lese  und  dabei  betrachte, \nwie  er  die  Alten  behandelt;  denn  er  macht  wenig  Worte, \nsie  sind  aber  alle  gewichtig.  Das  vierte  Buch,  das  die \nantiken  Tempel  darstellt,  ist  eine  rechte  Einleitung,  die \nalten  Reste  mit  Sinn  zu  beschauen. \n\nDen  7.  Oktober. \nGestern  abend  sah  ich  Elektra  von  Crebillon,  auf  dem \nTheater  San  Crisostomo,  nämlich  übersetzt.  Was  mir  das \nStück  abgeschmackt  vorkam  und  wie  es  mir  fürchterlich \nLangeweile  machte,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen. \nDie  Akteurs  sind  übrigens  brav  und  wissen  das  Publikum \nmit  einzelnen  Stellen  abzuspeisen!  Orest  hat  allein  drei \nverschiedene  Erzählungen,  poetisch  aufgestutzt,  in  eii?cr \nSzene.  Elektra,  ein  hübsches  Weibchen  von  mittlerer \nGröße  und  Stärke  und  fast  französischer  Lebhaftigkeit, \neinem  guten  Anstand,  spricht  die  Verse  schön;  nur  be- \ntrug sie  sich  von  Anfang  bis  zu  Ende  toll,  wie  es  leider \ndie  Rolle  verlangt.  Indessen  habe  ich  doch  wieder  ge- \nlernt. Der  italienische,  immer  eilfsilbige  Jambe  hat  für \ndie  Deklamation  große  Unbequemlichkeit,  weil  die  letzte \nSilbe  durchaus  kurz  ist  und,  wider  Willen  des  Deklama- \ntors, in  die  Höhe  schlägt. \n\nHeute  früh  war  ich  bei  dem  Hochamte,  welchem  der \nDoge  jährlich  an  diesem  Tage,  wegen  eines  alten  Siegs \nüber  die  Türken,  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen  Justina  bei- \nwohnen muß.  Wenn  an  dem  kleinen  Platz  die  vergolde- \nten Barken  landen,  die  den  Fürsten  und  einen  Teil  des \nAdels  bringen,  seltsam  gekleidete  Schiffer  sich  mit  rot \ngemalten  Bmdern  bemühen,  am  Ufer  die  Geistlichkeit,  die \nBrüdersch:ni\"ten  mit  angezündeten,  auf  Stangen  und  trag- \nbare silbeere  Leuchter  gesteckten  Kerzen  stehen,  drängen, \nwogen  'raue  warten,  dann  mit  Teppichen  beschlagene \nBrücker  Rühiden  Fahrzeugen  ans  Land  gestreckt  werden, \nzuerst  lein  Angen  violetten  Kleider  der  Savj,  dann  die \nlangersce,  e  der  Senatoren  sich  auf  dem  Pflaster  ent- \nfalten jhte,  da:  der  Alte,  mit  goldener  phrygischer  Mütze \ngeschilalamocan  längsten  goldenen  Talar,  mit  dem  Her- \n\n\n88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nmelinmantel,  aussteigt,  drei  Diener  sich  seiner  Schleppe \nbemächtigen,  alles  auf  einem  kleinen  Platz  vor  dem  Portal \neiner  Kirche,  vor  deren  Türen  die  Türkenfahnen  gehal- \nten werden,  so  glaubt  man  auf  einmal  eine'  alte  gewirkte \nTapete  zu  sehen,  aber  recht  gut  gezeichnet  und  koloriert. \nMir  nordischem  Flüchtling  hat  diese  Zeremonie  viele \nFreude  gemacht.  Bei  uns,  wo  alle  Feierlichkeiten  kurz- \nröckig  sind  und  wo  die  größte,  die  man  sich  denken  kann, \nmit  dem  Gewehr  auf  der  Schulter  begangen  wird,  möchte \nso  etwas  nicht  am  Ort  sein.  Aber  hierher  gehören  diese \nSchleppröcke,  diese  friedlichen  Begehungen. \nDer  Doge  ist  ein  gar  schön  gewachsener  und  schön  ge- \nbildeter Mann,  der  krank  sein  mag,  sich  aber  nur  noch \nso,  um  der  Würde  willen,  unter  dem  schweren  Rocke \ngerade  hält.  Sonst  sieht  er  aus  wie  der  Großpapa  des \nganzen  Geschlechts  und  ist  gar  hold  und  leutselig;  die \nKleidung  steht  sehr  gut,  das  Käppchen  unter  der  Mütze \nbeleidigt  nicht,  indem  es,  ganz  fein  und  dui-chsichtig,  auf \ndem  weißesten,  klarsten  Haar  von  der  Welt  ruht. \nEtwa  fünfzig  Nobili,  in  langen  dunkelroten  Schleppklei- \ndern, waren  mit  ihm,  meist  schöne  Männer,  keine  einzige \nvertrackte  Gestalt,  mehrere  groß,  mit  großen  Köpfen, \ndenen  die  blonden  Lockenperücken  wohl  ziemten;  vorge- \nbaute Gesichter,  weiches,  weißes  Fleisch,  ohne  schwam- \nmig und  widerwärtig  auszusehen,  vielmehr  klug,  ohne \nAnstrengung,  ruhig,  ihrer  selbst  gewiß,  Leichtigkeit  des \nDaseins  und  durchaus  eine  gewisse  Fröhlichkeit. \nWie  sich  alles  in  der  Kirche  rangiert  hatte  und  das \nHochamt  anfing,  zogen  die  Brüderschaften  zur  Haupttüre \nherein  und  zur  rechten  Seitentüre  wieder  hinaus,  nach- \ndem sie,  Paar  für  Paar,  das  Weihwasser  empfangen  und \nsich  gegen  den  Hochaltar,  den  Dogen  und  den(  Adel  ge- \nneigt hatten.  i \n\nAuf  heute  abend  hatte  ich  mir  den  famosen  Gesang  der \nSchiffer  bestellt,  die  den  Tasso  und  Ariost  auf  ihre  eignen \nMelodien  singen.  Dieses  muß  wirklich  bestellt  werden, \nes  kommt  nicht  gewöhnlich  vor,  es  gehört  vielmehr  zu \nden  halbverklungenen  Sagen  der  Vorzeit.    Bei  Monden- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  89 \n\nschein  bestieg  ich  eine  Gondel,  den  einen  Sänger  vorn, \nden  andern  hinten;  sie  fingen  ihr  Lied  an  und  sangen \nabwechselnd  Vers  für  Vers.  Die  Melodie,  welche  wir \ndurch  Rousseau  kennen,  ist  eine  Mittelart  zwischen  Choral \nund  Rezitativ,  sie  behält  immer  denselben  Gang,  ohne \nTakt  zu  haben;  die  Modulation  ist  auch  dieselbige,  nur \nverändern  sie,  nach  dem  Inhalt  des  Verses,  mit  einer  Art \nvon  Deklamation  sowohl  Ton  als  Maß;  der  Geist  aber, \ndas  Leben  davon,  läßt  sich  begreifen  wie  folgt. \nAuf  welchem  Wege  sich  die  Melodie  gemacht  hat,  will \nich  nicht  untersuchen,  genug,  sie  paßt  gar  trefflich  für \neinen  müßigen  Menschen,  der  sich  etwas  vormoduliert \nund  Gedichte,  die  er  auswendig  kann,  solchem  Gesang \nunterschiebt. \n\nMit  einer  durchdringenden  Stimme — das  Volk  schätzt \nStärke  vor  allem — sitzt  er  am  Ufer  einer  Insel,  eines \nKanals,  auf  einer  Barke  und  läßt  sein  Lied  schallen,  so \nweit  er  kann.  Über  den  stillen  Spiegel  verbreitet  sich's. \nIn  der  Ferne  vernimmt  es  ein  anderer,  der  die  Melodie \nkennt,  die  Worte  versteht  und  mit  dem  folgenden  Verse \nantwortet;  hierauf  erwidert  der  erste,  und  so  ist  einer \nimmer  das  Echo  des  andern.  Der  Gesang  währt  Nächte \ndurch,  unterhält  sie,  ohne  zu  ermüden.  Je  ferner  sie  also \nvoneinander  sind,  desto  reizender  kann  das  Lied  werden; \nwenn  der  Hörer  alsdann  zwischen  beiden  steht,  so  ist  er \nam  rechten  Flecke. \n\nUm  dieses  mich  vernehmen  zu  lassen,  stiegen  sie  am \nUfer  der  Giudecca  aus;  sie  teilten  sich  am  Kanal  hin,  ich \nging  zwischen  ihnen  auf  und  ab,  so  daß  ich  immer  den \nverließ,  der  zu  singen  anfangen  sollte,  und  mich  dem- \njenigen wieder  näherte,  der  aufgehört  hatte.  Da  ward \nmir  der  Sinn  des  Gesangs  erst  aufgeschlossen.  Als  Stimme \naus  der  Feme  klingt  es  höchst  sonderbar,  wie  eine  Klage \nohne  Trauer;  es  ist  darin  etwas  unglaublich,  bis  zu \nTränen  Rührendes.  Ich  schrieb  es  meiner  Stimmung  zu; \naber  mein  Alter  sagte:  6  singolare,  come  quel  canto  in- \ntenerisce,  e  molto  piü,  quando  e  piü  ben  cantato.  Er \nwünschte,  daß  ich  die  Weiber  vom  Lido,  besonders  die \nvon  Malamocco  und  Palestrina  hören  möchte;  auch  diese \n\n\n90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsängen  den  Tasso  auf  gleiche  und  ähnliche  Melodien. \nEr  sagte  ferner:  Sie  haben  die  Gewohnheit,  wenn  ihre \nMänner  aufs  Fischen  ins  Meer  sind,  sich  ans  Ufer  zu \nsetzen  und  mit  durchdringender  Stimme  abends  diese \nGesänge  erschallen  zu  lassen,  bis  sie  auch  von  ferne  die \nStimme  der  Ihrigen  vernehmen  und  sich  so  mit  ihnen \nunterhalten.  Ist  das  nicht  sehr  schön  .>  Und  doch  läßt \nsich  wohl  denken,  daß  ein  Zuhörer  in  der  Nähe  wenig \nFreude  an  solchen  Stimmen  haben  möchte,  die  mit  den \nWellen  des  Meeres  kämpfen.  Menschlich  aber  und  wahr \nwird  der  Begriff  dieses  Gesanges,  lebendig  wird  die \nMelodie,  über  deren  tote  Buchstaben  wir  uns  sonst  den \nKopf  zerbrochen  haben.  Gesang  ist  es  eines  Einsamen  in \ndie  Ferne  und  Weite,  damit  ein  anderer,  Gleichgestimm- \nter, höre  und  antworte. \n\nDen  8.  Oktober. \nDen  Palast  Pisani  Moretta  besuchte  ich  wegen  eines  köst- \nlichen Bildes  von  Paul  Veronese.     Die  weibliche  Familie \ndes  Darius  kniet  vor  Alexandern  und  Hephästion:    die \nvoranknieende  Mutter  hält  den  letztern  für  den  König; \ner  lehnt  es  ab  und  deutet  auf  den  Rechten.    Man  erzählt \ndas  Märchen,  der  Künstler  sei  in  diesem  Palast  gut  auf- \ngenommen und  längere  Zeit  ehrenvoll  bewirtet  worden, \ndagegen  habe  er  das  Bild  heimlich  gemalt  und,  als  Ge- \nschenk, zusammengerollt  unter  das  Bett  geschoben.    Es \nverdient  allerdings  einen  besondern  Ursprung  zu  haben, \ndenn  es  gibt  einen  Begriff  von  dem  ganzen  Werte  des \nMeisters.     Seine  große  Kunst,   ohne  einen  allgemeinen \nTon,    der   über  das   ganze  Stück   gezogen  wäre,  durch \nkunstreich  verteiltes  Licht  und  Schatten  und  ebenso  weis- \nlich abwechselnde  Lokalfarben  die  köstlichste  Harmonie \nhervorzubringen,  ist  hier  recht  sichtbar,  da  das  Bild  voll- \nkommen erhalten  und  frisch,  wie  von  gestern    vor  uns \nsteht:  denn  freilich,  sobald  ein  Gemälde  dieser  Art  ge- \nlitten hat,  wird  unser  Genuß  sogleich  getrübt,  ohne  daß \nwir  wissen,  was  die  Ursache  sei. \n\nWer    mit  dem    Künstler   wegen   des  Kostüms   rechten \nwollte,  der  dürfte  sich  nur  sagen,  es  habe  eine  Geschichte \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  91 \n\ndes  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  gemalt  werden  sollen,  und \nso  ist  alles  abgetan.  Die  Abstufung  von  der  Mutter  durch \nGemahlin  und  Töchter  ist  höchst  wahr  und  glücklich;  die \njüngste  Prinzeß,  ganz  am  Ende  knieend,  ist  ein  hübsches \nMäuschen  und  hat  ein  gar  artiges,  eigensinniges,  trotziges \nGesichtchen,  ihre  Lage  scheint  ihr  gar  nicht  zu  gefallen. \n\nMeine  alte  Gabe,  die  Welt  mit  Augen  desjenigen  Malers \nzu  sehen,  dessen  Bilder  ich  mir  eben  eingedrückt,  brachte \nmich  auf  einen  eignen  Gedanken.  Es  ist  offenbar,  daß \nsich  das  Auge  nach  den  Gegenständen  bildet,  die  es  von \nJugend  auf  erblickt,  und  so  muß  der  venezianische  Maler \nalles  klarer  und  heiterer  sehn  als  andere  Menschen.  Wir, \ndie  wir  auf  einem  bald  schmutzkotigen,  bald  staubigen, \nfarblosen,  die  Widerscheine  verdüsternden  Boden,  und \nvielleicht  gar  in  engen  Gemächern  leben,  können  einen \nsolchen  Frohblick  aus  uns  selbst  nicht  entwickeln. \nAls  ich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  durch  die  Lagunen \nfuhr  und  auf  den  Gondelrändern  die  Gondoliere  leicht \nschwebend,  buntbekleidet,  rudernd  betrachtete,  wie  sie \nauf  der  hellgrünen  Fläche  sich  in  der  blauen  Luft  zeich- \nneten, so  sah  ich  das  beste,  frischeste  Bild  der  venezia- \nnischen Schule.  Der  Sonnenschein  hob  die  Lokalfarben \nblendend  hervor,  und  die  Schattenseiten  waren  so  licht, \ndaß  sie  verhältnismäßig  wieder  zu  Lichtern  hätten  dienen \nkönnen.  Ein  gleiches  galt  von  den  Widerscheinen  des \nmeergrünen  Wassers.  Alles  war  hell  in  hell  gemalt,  so \ndaß  die  schäumende  Welle  und  die  Blitzlichter  darauf \nnötig  waren,  um  die  Tüpfchen  aufs  i  zu  setzen. \nTizian  und  Paul  hatten  diese  Klarheit  im  höchsten  Grade, \nund  wo  man  sie  in  ihren  Werken  nicht  findet,  hat  das \nBild  verloren  oder  ist  aufgemalt. \n\nDie  Kuppeln  und  Gewölbe  der  Markuskirche,  nebst  ihren \nSeitenflächen,  alles  ist  bilderreich,  alles  bunte  Figuren \nauf  goldenem  Grunde,  alles  musivische  Arbeit;  einige \nsind  recht  gut,  andere  gering,  je  nachdem  die  Meister \nwaren,  die  den  Karton  verfertigten. \nEs  fiel  mir  recht  aufs  Herz,  daß  doch  alles  auf  die  erste \nErfindung  ankommt  und  daß  diese  das  rechte  Maß,  den \n\n\n92  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nwahren  Geist  habe,  da  man  mit  viereckten  Stückchen \nGlas,  und  hier  nicht  einmal  auf  die  sauberste  Weise,  das \nGute  sowohl  als  das  Schlechte  nachbilden  kann.  Die \nKunst,  welche  dem  Alten  seine  Fußboden  bereitete,  dem \nChristen  seine  Kirchenhimmel  wölbte,  hat  sich  jetzt  auf \nDosen  und  Armbänder  verkrümelt.  Diese  Zeiten  sind \nschlechter,  als  man  denkt. \n\nIn  dem  Hause  Farsetti  ist  eine  kostbare  Sammlung  von \nAbgüssen  der  besten  Antiken.  Ich  schweige  von  denen, \ndie  ich  von  Mannheim  her  und  sonst  schon  gekannt,  und \nerwähne  nur  neuere  Bekanntschaften.  Eine  Kleopatra  in \nkolossaler  Ruhe,  die  Aspis  um  den  Arm  geschlungen  und \nin  den  Tod  hinüberschlafend;  ferner  die  Mutter  Niobe, \ndie  ihre  jüngste  Tochter  mit  dem  Mantel  vor  den  Pfeilen \ndes  Apollo  deckt;  sodann  einige  Gladiatoren,  ein  in  sei- \nnen Flügeln  ruhender  Genius,  sitzende  und  stehende \nPhilosophen. \n\nEs  sind  Werke,  an  denen  sich  die  Welt  Jahrtausende \nfreuen  und  bilden  kann,  ohne  den  Wert  des  Künstlers \ndurch  Gedanken  zu  erschöpfen. \n\nViele  bedeutende  Büsten  versetzen  mich  in  die  alten \nherrlichen  Zeiten.  Nur  fühle  ich  leider,  wie  weit  ich  in \ndiesen  Kenntnissen  zurück  bin;  doch  es  wird  vorwärts \ngehen,  wenigstens  weiß  ich  den  Weg.  Palladio  hat  mir \nihn  auch  dazu,  und  zu  aller  Kunst  und  Leben  geöffnet. \nEs  klingt  das  vielleicht  ein  wenig  wunderlich,  aber  doch \nnicht  so  paradox,  als  wenn  Jakob  Böhme  bei  Erblickung \neiner  zinnernen  Schüssel  durch  Einstrahlung  Jovis  über \ndas  Universum  erleuchtet  wurde.  Auch  steht  in  dieser \nSammlung  ein  Stück  des  Gebälks  vom  Tempel  des  An- \ntonius und  der  Faustina  in  Rom.  Die  vorspringende \nGegenwart  dieses  herrlichen  Architekturgebildes  erinnerte \nmich  an  das  Kapital  des  Pantheon  in  Mannheim.  Das  ist \nfreilich  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  kauzenden,  auf  Krag- \nsteinlein übereinander  geschichteten  Heiligen  der  goti- \nschen Zierweisen,  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  Tabakspfeifen - \nSäulen,  spitze  Türmlein  und  Blumenzacken;  diese  bin  ich \nnun,  Gott  sei  Dank,  auf  ewig  los! \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  93 \n\nNoch  will  ich  einiger  Werke  der  Bildhauerkunst  erwähnen, \ndie  ich  diese  Tage  her,  zwar  nur  im  Vorbeigehen,  aber \ndoch  mit  Erstaunen  und  Erbauung  betrachtet:  zwei  un- \ngeheure Löwen,  von  weißem  Marmor,  vor  dem  Tore  des \nArsenals;  der  eine  sitzt  aufgerichtet,  auf  die  Vorder- \npfoten gestemmt,  der  andere  liegt — herrliche  Gegenbilder \nvon  lebendiger  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Sie  sind  so  groß,  daß \nsie  alles  umher  klein  machen  und  daß  man  selbst  zu- \nnichte würde,  wenn  erhabene  Gegenstände  uns  nicht  er- \nhüben. Sie  sollen  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit  und \nvom  Piraeus  in  den  glänzenden  Tagen  der  Republik  hier- \nher gebracht  sein. \n\nAus  Athen  mögen  gleichfalls  ein  paar  Basreliefe  stam- \nmen, in  dem  Tempel  der  heiligen  Justina,  der  Türken- \nbesiegerin,  eingemauert,  aber  leider  durch  Kirchstühle \neinigermaßen  verfinstert.  Der  Küster  machte  mich  auf- \nmerksam darauf,  weil  die  Sage  gehe,  daß  Tizian  seine \nunendlich  schönen  Engel  im  Bilde,  die  Ermordung  des \nheiligen  Petrus  Martyr  vorstellend,  darnach  geformt  habe. \nEs  sind  Genien,  welche  sich  mit  Attributen  der  Götter \nschleppen,  freilich  so  schön,  daß  es  allen  Begriff  über- \nsteigt. \n\nSodann  betrachtete  ich  mit  ganz  eignem  Gefühl  die \nnackte  kolossale  Statue  des  Markus  Agrippa,  in  dem  Hofe \neines  Palastes;  ein  sich  ihm  zur  Seite  heraufschlängeln- \nder Delphin  deutet  auf  einen  Seehelden.  Wie  doch  eine \nsolche  heroische  Darstellung  den  reinen  Menschen  Göt- \ntern ähnlich  macht! \n\nDie  Pferde  auf  der  Markuskirche  besah  ich  in  der  Nähe. \nVon  unten  hinauf  bemerkt  man  leicht,  daß  sie  fleckig \nsind,  teils  einen  schönen  gelben  Metallglanz  haben,  teils \nkupfergrünlich  angelaufen.  In  der  Nähe  sieht  und  erfährt \nman,  daß  sie  ganz  verguldet  waren,  und  sieht  sie  über \nund  über  mit  Striemen  bedeckt,  da  die  Barbaren  das \nGold  nicht  abfeilen,  sondern  abhauen  wollten.  Auch  das \nist  gut,  so  blieb  wenigstens  die  Gestalt. \nEin  herrlicher  Zug  Pferde!  ich  möchte  einen  rechten \nPferdekenner  darüber  reden  hören.     Was  mir  sonderbar \n\n\n94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nscheint,  ist,  daß  sie  in  der  Nähe  schwer  und  unten  vom \nPlatz  leicht  wie  die  Hirsche  aussehen. \n\nIch  fuhr  heute  früh  mit  meinem  Schutzgeiste  aufs  Lido, \nauf  die  Erdzunge,  welche  die  Lagunen  schließt  und  sie \nvom  Meere  absondert.  Wir  stiegen  aus  und  gingen  quer \nüber  die  Zunge.  Ich  hörte  ein  starkes  Geräusch:  es  war \n(las  Meer,  und  ich  sah  es  bald,  es  ging  hoch  gegen  das \nUfer,  indem  es  sich  zurückzog,  es  war  um  Mittag,  Zeit \nder  Ebbe.  So  habe  ich  denn  auch  das  Meer  mit  Augen \ngesehen  und  bin  auf  der  schönen  Tenne,  die  es  weichend \nzurückläßt,  ihm  nachgegangen.  Da  hätte  ich  mir  die \nKinder  gewünscht,  um  der  Muscheln  willen;  ich  habe, \nselbst  kindisch,  ihrer  genug  aufgelesen;  doch  widme  ich \nsie  zu  einigem  Gebrauch:  ich  möchte  von  der  Feuchtig- \nkeit des  Tintenfisches,  die  hier  so  häufig  wegfließt,  etwas \neintrocknen. \n\nAuf  dem  Lido,  nicht  weit  vom  Meer,  liegen  Engländer \nbegraben,  und  weiterhin  Juden,  die  beiderseits  in  ge- \nweihtem Boden  nicht  ruhen  sollten.  Ich  fand  das  Grab \ndes  edlen  Konsul  Smith  und  seiner  ersten  Frauen;  ich \nbin  ihm  mein  Exemplar  des  Palladio  schuldig  und  dankte \nihm  auf  seinem  ungeweihten  Grabe  dafür, \nlind  nicht  allein  ungeweiht,  sondern  halbverschüttet  ist \ndas  Grab.  Das  Lido  ist  immer  nur  wie  eine  Düne  anzu- \nsehen; der  Sand  wird  dorthin  geführt,  vom  Winde  hin \nund  her  getrieben,  aufgehäuft,  überall  angedrängt.  In \nweniger  Zeit  wird  man  das  ziemlich  erhöhte  Monument \nkaum  wiederfinden  können. \n\nDas  Meer  ist  doch  ein  großer  Anblick!  Ich  will  sehen, \nin  einem  Fischerkahn  eine  Fahrt  zu  tun:  die  Gondeln \nwagen  sich  nicht  hinaus. \n\nAm  Meere  habe  ich  auch  verschiedene  Pflanzen  gefun- \nden, deren  ähnlicher  Charakter  mir  ihre  Eigenschaften \nnäher  kennen  ließ:  sie  sind  alle  zugleich  mastig  und \nstreng,  saftig  und  zäh,  und  es  ist  offenbar,  daß  das  alte \nSalz  des  Sandbodens,  mehr  aber  die  salzige  Luft  ihnen \ndiese  Eigenschaften  gibt;    sie  strotzen  von  Säften,  wie \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  95 \n\nWasserpflanzen,  sie  sind  fest  und  zäh,  wie  Bergpflanzen; \nwenn  ihre  Blätterenden  eine  Neigung  zu  Stacheln  haben, \nwie  Disteln  tun,  sind  sie  gewaltig  spitz  und  stark.  Ich \nfand  einen  solchen  Busch  Blätter;  es  schien  mir  unser \nunschuldiger  Huflattich,  hier  aber  mit  scharfen  Wafien \nbewatihet,  und  das  Blatt  wie  Leder,  so  auch  die  Samen- \nkapseln, die  Stiele,  alles  mastig  und  fest.  Ich  bringe \nSamen  mit  und  eingelegte  Blätter  (Eryngium  mari- \ntimum). \n\nDer  Fischmarkt  und  die  unendlichen  Seeprodukte  machen \nmir  viel  Vergnügen;  ich  gehe  oft  darüber  und  beleuchte \ndie  unglücklichen  aufgehaschten  Meeresbewohner. \n\nDen  g.  Oktober. \nEin  köstlicher  Tag,  vom  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht!  Ich \nfuhr  bis  Palestrina  gegen  Chiozza  über,  wo  die  großen \nBaue  sind,  Murazzi  genannt,  welche  die  Republik  gegen \ndas  Meer  aufführen  läßt.  Sie  sind  von  gehauenen  Stei- \nnen und  sollen  eigentlich  die  lange  Erdzunge,  Lido  ge- \nnannt, welche  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere  trennt,  vor \ndiesem  wilden  Elemente  schützen. \n\nDie  Lagunen  sind  eine  Wirkung  der  alten  Natur.  Erst \nEbbe,  Flut  und  Erde,  gegeneinander  arbeitend,  dann \ndas  allmähliche  Sinken  des  Urgewässers  waren  Ursache, \ndaß  am  obern  Ende  des  Adriatischen  Meeres  sich  eine \nansehnliche  Sumpfstrecke  befindet,  welche  von  der  Flut \nbesucht,  von  der  Ebbe  zum  Teil  verlassen  wird.  Die \nKunst  hat  sich  der  höchsten  Stellen  bemächtigt,  und  so \nliegt  Venedig,  von  hundert  Inseln  zusammen  gruppiert \nund  von  hunderten  umgeben.  Zugleich  hat  man,  mit  un- \nglaublicher Anstrengung  und  Kosten,  tiefe  Kanäle  in  den \nSumpf  gefurcht,  damit  man  auch  zur  Zeit  der  Ebbe  mit \nKriegsschiffen  an  die  Hauptstellen  gelangen  könne.  Was \nMenschenwitz  und  Fleiß  vor  alters  ersonnen  und  ausge- \nführt, muß  Klugheit  und  Fleiß  nun  erhalten.  Das  Lido, \nein  langer  Erdstreif,  trennt  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere, \nwelches  nur  an  zwei  Orten  hereintreten  kann,  bei  dem \nKastell  nämlich  und  am  entgegengesetzten  Ende,  bei \nChiozza.     Die  Flut  tritt  gewöhnlich  des  Tages  zweimal \n\n\n96  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nherein,  und  die  Ebbe  bringt  das  Wasser  zweimal  hinaus, \nimmer  durch  denselben  Weg  in  denselben  Richtungen. \nDie  Flut  bedeckt  die  innern  morastigen  Stellen  und  läßt \ndie  erhühteren,  wo  nicht  trocken,  doch  sichtbar. \nGanz  anders  wäre  es,  wenn  das  Meer  sich  neue  Wege \nsuchte,  die  Erdzunge  angriffe  und  nach  Willkür  hinein \nund  heraus  flutete.  Nicht  gerechnet,  daß  die  Örtchen \nauf  dem  Lido,  Palestrina,  St.  Peter  und  andere,  unter- \ngehen müßten,  so  würden  auch  jene  Kommunikations- \nkanäle ausgefüllt  und,  indem  das  Wasser  alles  durchein- \nander schlemmte,  das  Lido  zu  Inseln,  die  Inseln,  die \njetzt  dahinterliegen,  zu  Erdzungen  verwandelt  werden. \nDieses  zu  verhüten,  müssen  sie  das  Lido  verwahren,  was \nsie  können,  damit  das  Element  nicht  dasjenige  willkür- \nlich angreifen,  hinüber  und  herüber  werfen  möge,  was \ndie  Menschen  schon  in  Besitz  genommen,  dem  sie  schon \nzu  einem  gewissen  Zweck  Gestalt  und  Richtung  gegeben \nhaben. \n\nBei  außerordentlichen  Fällen,  wenn  das  Meer  übermäßig \nwächst,  ist  es  besonders  gut,  daß  es  nur  an  zwei  Orten \nherein  darf  und  das  übrige  geschlossen  bleibt;  es  kann \nalso  doch  nicht  mit  der  größten  Gewalt  eindringen  und \nmuß  sich  in  einigen  Stunden  dem  Gesetz  der  Ebbe  unter- \nwerfen und  seine  Wut  mindern. \n\nÜbrigens  hat  Venedig  nichts  zu  besorgen:  die  Langsam- \nkeit, mit  der  das  Meer  abnimmt,  gibt  ihr  Jahrtausende \nZeit,  und  sie  werden  schon,  den  Kanälen  klug  nach- \nhelfend, sich  im  Besitz  zu  erhalten  suchen. \nWenn  sie  ihre  Stadt  nur  reinlicher  hielten,  welches  so \nnotwendig  als  leicht  ist  und  wirklich,  auf  die  Folge  von \nJahrhunderten,  von  großer  Konsequenz.  Nun  ist  zwar \nbei  großer  Strafe  verboten,  nichts  in  die  Kanäle  zu \nschütten  noch  Kehricht  hineinzuwerfen;  einem  schnell \neinfallenden  Regenguß  aber  ist's  nicht  untersagt,  allen \nden  in  die  Ecken  geschobnen  Kehricht  aufzurühren,  in \ndie  Kanäle  zu  schleppen,  ja,  was  noch  schlimmer  ist,  in \ndie  Abzüge  zu  führen,  die  nur  zum  Abfluß  des  Wassers \nbestimmt  sind,  und  sie  dergestalt  zu  verschlemmen,  daß \ndie  Hauptplätze  in  Gefahr  sind,  unter  Wasser  zu  stehen. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  97 \n\nSelbst  einige  Abzüge  auf  dem  kleinen  Markusplatze,  die, \nwie  auf  dem  großen,  gar  klug  angelegt  sind,  habe  ich \nverstopft  und  voll  Wasser  gesehen. \n\nWenn  ein  Tag  Regenwetter  einfällt,  ist  ein  unleidlicher \nKot;  alles  flucht  und  schimpft,  man  besudelt  beim  Auf- \nund  Absteigen  der  Brücken  die  Mäntel,  die  Tabarros, \nwomit  man  sich  ja  das  ganze  Jahr  schleppt,  und  da  alles \nin  Schuh  und  Strümpfen  läuft,  bespritzt  man  sich  und \nschilt;  denn  man  hat  sich  nicht  mit  gemeinem,  sondern \nbeizendem  Kot  besudelt.  Das  Wetter  wird  wieder  schön, \nund  kein  Mensch  denkt  an  Reinlichkeit.  Wie  wahr  ist  es \ngesagt:  das  Publikum  beklagt  sich  immer,  daß  es  schlecht \nbedient  sei,  und  weiß  es  nicht  anzufangen,  besser  be- \ndient zu  werden.  Hier,  wenn  der  Souverän  wollte,  könnte \nalles  gleich  getan  sein. \n\nHeute  abend  ging  ich  auf  den  Markustumi;  denn  da  ich \nneulich  die  Lagunen  in  ihrer  Herrlichkeit,  zur  Zeit  der \nFlut,  von  oben  gesehen,  wollt'  ich  sie  auch  zur  Zeit  der \nEbbe,  in  ihrer  Demut,  schauen,  und  es  ist  notwendig, \ndiese  beiden  Bilder  zu  verbinden,  wenn  man  einen  rich- \ntigen Begrift\"  haben  will.  Es  sieht  sonderbar  aus,  ringsum \nüberall  Land  erscheinen  zu  sehen,  wo  vorher  Wasser- \nspiegel war.  Die  Inseln  sind  nicht  mehr  Inseln,  nur \nhöher  bebaute  Flecke  eines  großen  graugrünlichen  Mo- \nrastes, den  schöne  Kanäle  durchschneiden.  Der  sumpfige \nTeil  ist  mit  Wasserpflanzen  bewachsen  und  muß  sich  auch \ndadurch  nach  imd  nach  erheben,  obgleich  Ebbe  und  Flut \nbeständig  daran  rupfen  und  wühlen  und  der  Vegetation \nkeine  Ruhe  lassen. \n\nIch  wende  mich  mit  meiner  Erzählung  nochmals  ans  Meer. \nDort  habe  ich  heute  die  Wirtschaft  der  Seeschnecken,  Pa- \ntellen und  Taschenkrebse  gesehen  und  mich  herzlich  dar- \nüber gefreut.  Was  ist  doch  ein  Lebendiges  für  ein  köst- \nliches, herrliches  Ding!  wie  abgemessen  zu  seinem  Zu- \nstande, wie  wahr,  wie  seiend!  Wie  viel  nützt  mir  nicht  mein \nbißchen  Studium  der  Natur,  und  wie  freue  ich  mich,  es \nfortzusetzen!  Doch  ich  will,  da  es  sich  mitteilen  läßt,  die \nFreunde  nicht  mit  bloßen  Ausrufungen  anreizen. \n\nGOETHE  IV  7 \n\n\n98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  dem  Meere  entgegengebauten  Mauerwerke  bestehen \nerst  aus  einigen  steilen  Stufen,  dann  kommt  eine  sacht \nansteigende  Fläche,  sodann  wieder  eine  Stufe,  abermals \neine  sanft  ansteigende  Fläche,  dann  eine  steile  Mauer \nmit  einem  oben  überhängenden  Kopfe.  Diese  Stufen,  diese \nFlächen  hinan  steigt  nun  das  flutende  Meer,  bis  es,  in \naußerordentlichen  Fällen,  endlich  oben  an  der  Mauer \nund  deren  Vorsprung  zerschellt. \n\nDem  Meere  folgen  seine  Bewohner,  kleine  eßbare  Schnek- \nken,  einschalige  Patellen,  und  was  sonst  noch  beweg- \nlich ist,  besonders  die  Taschenkrebse.  Kaum  aber  haben \ndiese  Tiere  an  den  glatten  Mauern  Besitz  genommen,  so \nzieht  sich  schon  das  Meer,  weichend  und  schwellend,  wie \nes  gekommen,  wieder  zurück.  Anfangs  weiß  das  Ge- \nwimmel nicht,  woran  es  ist,  und  hoftt  immer,  die  salzige \nFlut  soll  wiederkehren;  allein  sie  bleibt  aus,  die  Sonne \nsticht  und  trocknet  schnell,  und  nun  geht  der  Rückzug \nan.  Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  suchen  die  Taschenkrebse \nihren  Raub.  Wunderlicher  und  komischer  kann  man \nnichts  sehen  als  die  Gebärden  dieser  aus  einem  runden \nKörper  und  zwei  langen  Scheren  bestehenden  Geschöpfe; \ndenn  die  übrigen  Spinnenfüße  sind  nicht  bemerklich.  Wie \nauf  stelzenartigen  Armen  schreiten  sie  einher,  und  so- \nbald eine  Patelle  sich  unter  ihrem  Schild  vom  Flecke \nbewegt,  fahren  sie  zu,  um  die  Schere  in  den  schmalen \nRaum  zwischen  der  Schale  und  dem  Boden  zu  stecken, \ndas  Dach  umzukehren  und  die  Auster  zu  verschmausen. \nDie  Patelle  zieht  sachte  ihren  Weg  hin,  saugt  sich  aber \ngleich  fest  an  den  Stein,  sobald  sie  die  Nähe  des  Feindes \nmerkt.  Dieser  gebärdet  sich  nun  wunderlich  um  das \nDächelchen  herum,  gar  zierlich  und  alienhaft;  aber  ihm \nfehlt  die  Kraft,  den  mächtigen  Muskel  des  weichen  Tier- \nchens zu  überwältigen,  er  tut  auf  diese  Beute  Verzicht, \neilt  auf  eine  andere  wandernde  los,  und  die  erste  setzt \nihren  Zug  sachte  fort.  Ich  habe  nicht  gesehen,  daß  irgend \nein  Taschenkrebs  zu  seinem  Zweck  gelangt  wäre,  ob  ich \ngleich  den  Rückzug  dieses  Gewimmels  stundenlang,  wie \nsie  die  beiden  Flächen  und  die  dazwischen  liegenden \nStufen  hinabschlichen,  beobachtet  habe. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  99 \n\nDcti  10.  Oktober. \nNun  endlich  kann  ich  denn  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  eine  Ko- \nmödie gesehen  habe!  Sie  spielten  heut  auf  dem  Theater \nSt.  Lukas:  Le  Baruffe  Chiozzotte,  welches  allenfalls  zu \nübersetzen  wäre:  Die  Rauf-  und  Schreihändel  von  Chi- \nozza.  Die  Handelnden  sind  lauter  Seeleute,  Einwohner \nvon  Chiozza,  und  ihre  Weiber,  Schwestern  und  Töchter. \nDas  gewöhnliche  Geschrei  dieser  Leute,  im  Guten  und \nBösen,  ihre  Händel,  Heftigkeit,  Gutmütigkeit,  Plattheit, \nWitz,  Humor  und  ungezwungene  Manieren,  alles  ist  gar \nbrav  nachgeahmt.  Das  Stück  ist  noch  von  Goldoni,  und \nda  ich  erst  gestern  in  jener  Gegend  war  und  mir  Stim- \nmen und  Betragen  der  See-  und  Hafenleute  noch  im \nAug'  und  Ohr  widerschien  und  widerklang,  so  machte \nes  gar  große  Freude,  und  ob  ich  gleich  manchen  einzel- \nnen Bezug  nicht  verstand,  so  konnte  ich  doch  dem  Gan- \nzen recht  gut  folgen.  Der  Plan  des  Stücks  ist  folgender. \nDie  Einwohnerinnen  von  Chiozza  sitzen  auf  der  Reede \nvor  ihren  Häusern,  spinnen,  stricken,  nähen,  klippein, \nwie  gewöhnlich;  ein  junger  Mensch  geht  vorüber  und \ngrüßt  eine  freundlicher  als  die  übrigen;  sogleich  fängt \ndas  Sticheln  an;  dies  hält  nicht  Maße,  es  schärft  sich  und \nwächst  bis  zum  Hohne,  steigert  sich  zu  Vorwürfen,  eine \nUnart  überbietet  die  andere;  eine  heftige  Nachbarin  platzt \nmit  der  Wahrheit  heraus,  und  nun  ist  Schelten,  Schimp- \nfen, Schreien  auf  einmal  losgebunden,  es  fehlt  nicht  an \nentschiedenen  Beleidigungen,  so  daß  die  Gerichtspersonen \nsich  einzumischen  genötigt  sind. \n\nIm  zweiten  Akt  befindet  man  sich  in  der  Gerichtsstube. \nDer  Aktuarius  an  der  Stelle  des  abwesenden  Podesta,  der \nals  Nobile  nicht  auf  dem  Theater  hätte  erscheinen  dürfen, \nder  Aktuarius  also  läßt  die  Frauen  einzeln  vorfordern: \ndieses  wird  dadurch  bedenklich,  daß  er  selbst  in  die  erste \nLiebhaberin  verliebt  ist  und,  sehr  glücklich  sie  allein  zu \nsprechen,  anstatt  sie  zu  verhören  ihr  eine  Liebeserklärung \ntut.  Eine  andere,  die  in  den  Aktuarius  verliebt  ist,  stürzt \neifersüchtig  herein,  der  aufgeregte  Liebhaber  der  ersten \ngleichfalls,   die   übrigen   folgen,   neue   Vorwürfe  häufen \n\n\nloo  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich,  und  nun  ist  der  Teufel  in  der  Gerichtsstube  los,  wie \nvorher  auf  dem  Hafenplatz. \n\nIm  dritten  Akt  steigert  sich  der  Scherz,  und  das  Ganze \nendet  mit  einer  eiligen  notdürftigen  Auflösung.  Der  glück- \nlichste Gedanke  jedoch  ist  in  einem  Charakter  ausge- \ndrückt, der  sich  folgendermaßen  darstellt. \nEin  alter  Schiffer,  dessen  Gliedmaßen,  besonders  aber \ndie  Sprachorgane,  durch  eine  von  Jugend  auf  geführte \nharte  Lebensart  stockend  geworden,  tritt  auf,  als  Gegen- \nsatz des  beweglichen,  schwätzenden,  schreiseligen  Volkes; \ner  nimmt  immer  erst  einen  Anlauf  durch  Bewegung  der \nLippen  und  Nachhelfen  der  Hände  und  Arme,  bis  er \ndenn  endlich,  was  er  gedacht,  herausstößt.  Weil  ihm \ndieses  aber  nur  in  kurzen  Sätzen  gelingt,  so  hat  er  sich \neinen  lakonischen  Ernst  angewöhnt,  dergestalt,  daß  alles, \nwas  er  sagt,  sprüchwörtlich  oder  sentenzios  klingt,  wo- \ndurch denn  das  übrige  wilde,  leidenschaftliche  Handeln \ngar  schön  ins  Gleichgewicht  gesetzt  wird. \nAber  auch  so  eine  Lust  habe  ich  noch  nie  erlebt,  als  das \nVolk  laut  werden  ließ,  sich  und  die  Seinigen  so  natürlich \nvorstellen  zu  sehen.  Ein  Gelächter  und  Gejauchze  von \nAnfang  bis  zu  Ende.  Ich  muß  aber  auch  gestehen,  daß \ndie  Schauspieler  es  vortrefflich  machten.  Sie  hatten  sich, \nnach  Anlage  der  Charaktere,  in  die  verschiedenen  Stim- \nmen geteilt,  welche  unter  dem  Volk  gewöhnlich  vorkom- \nmen. Die  erste  Aktrice  war  allerliebst,  viel  besser  als  neu- \nlich in  Heldentracht  und  Leidenschaft.  Die  Frauen  über- \nhaupt, besonders  aber  diese,  ahmten  Stimme,  Gebärden \nund  Wesen  des  Volks  aufs  anmutigste  nach.  Großes  Lob \nverdient  der  Verfasser,  der  aus  nichts  den  angenehmsten \nZeitvertreib  gel)ildet  hat.  Das  kann  man  aber  auch  nur \nunmittelbar  seinem  eignen  lebenslustigen  Volk.  Es  ist \ndurchaus  mit  einer  geübten  Hand  geschrieben. \nVon  der  Truppe  Sacchi,  für  welche  Gozzi  arbeitete  und \ndie  übrigens  zerstreut  ist,  habe  ich  die  Smeraldina  ge- \nsehen, eine  kleine,  dicke  Figur,  voller  Leben,  Gewandt- \nheit und  guten  Humors.  Mit  ihr  sah  ich  den  }3righella, \neinen  hagem,  wohlgebauten,  besonders  in  Mienen-  und \nHändespiel  trefilichen  Schauspieler.    Diese  Masken,  die \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  loi \n\nwir  fast  nur  als  Mumien  kennen,  da  sie  für  uns  weder \nLeben  noch  Bedeutung  haben,  tun  hier  gar  zu  wohl,  als \nGeschöpfe  dieser  Landschaft.  Die  ausgezeichneten  Alter, \nCharaktere  und  Stände  haben  sich  in  wunderlichen  Klei- \ndern verkörpert,  und  wenn  man  selbst  den  größten  Teil \ndes  Jahrs  mit  der  Maske  herumläuft,  so  findet  man  nichts \nnatürlicher,  als  daß  da  droben  auch  schwarze  Gesichter \nerscheinen. \n\nDen  II.  Oktober. \n\nUnd  weil  die  Einsamkeit  in  einer  so  großen  Menschen- \nmasse denn  doch  zuletzt  nicht  recht  möglich  sein  will, \nso  bin  ich  mit  einem  alten  Franzosen  zusammengekom- \nmen, der  kein  Italienisch  kann,  sich  wie  verraten  und \nverkauft  fühlt  und,  mit  allen  Empfehlungsschreiben,  doch \nnicht  recht  weiß,  woran  er  ist.  Ein  Mann  von  Stande, \nsehr  guter  Lebensart,  der  aber  nicht  aus  sich  heraus  kann; \ner  mag  stark  in  den  Funfzigen  sein  und  hat  zu  Hause  einen \nsiebenjährigen  Knaben,  von  dem  er  bänglich  Nachrichten \nerwartet.  Ich  habe  ihm  einige  Gefälligkeiten  erzeigt;  er \nreist  durch  Italien  bequem,  aber  geschwind,  um  es  doch \neinmal  gesehen  zu  haben,  und  mag  sich  gern  im  Vorbei- \ngehen so  viel  wie  möglich  unterrichten;  ich  gebe  ihm \nAuskunft  über  manches.  Als  ich  mit  ihm  von  Venedig \nsprach,  fragte  er  mich,  wie  lange  ich  hier  sei,  und  als  er \nhörte,  nur  vierzehn  Tage  und  zum  erstenmal,  versetzte \ner:  II  parait  que  vous  n'avez  pas  perdu  votre  temps.  Das \nist  das  erste  Testimonium  meines  Wohlverhaltens,  das \nich  aufweisen  kann.  Er  ist  nun  acht  Tage  hier  und \ngeht  morgen  fort.  Es  war  mir  köstlich,  einen  recht  ein- \ngefleischten Versailler  in  der  Fremde  zu  sehen.  Der \nreist  nun  auch!  und  ich  betrachtete  mit  Erstaunen,  wie \nman  reisen  kann,  ohne  etwas  außer  sich  gewahr  zu  wer- \nden; und  er  ist  in  seiner  Art  ein  recht  gebildeter,  wackrer, \nordentlicher  Mann. \n\nDen  12.  Oktober. \nGestern  gaben  sie  zu  St.  Lukas  ein  neues  Stück:  LTngli- \ncismo  in  Italia.    Da  viele  Engländer  in  Italien  leben,  so \n\n\nI02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nist  es  natürlich,  daß  ihre  Sitten  bemerkt  werden,  und \nich  dachte  hier  zu  erfahren,  wie  die  ItaHener  diese  rei- \nchen und  ihnen  so  willkommenen  Gäste  betrachten;  aber \nes  war  ganz  und  gar  nichts.  Einige  glückliche  Narren- \nszenen, wie  immer,  das  übrige  aber  zu  schwer  und  ernst- \nlich gemeint,  und  denn  doch  keine  Spur  von  englischem \nSinn;  die  gewöhnlichen  italienischen  sittlichen  Gemein- \nsprüche, und  auch  nur  auf  das  Gemeinste  gerichtet. \nAuch  gefiel  es  nicht  und  war  auf  dem  Punkt,  ausgepfiffen \nzu  werden;  die  Schauspieler  fühlten  sich  nicht  in  ihrem \nElemente,  nicht  auf  dem  Platze  von  Chiozza.  Da  dies \ndas  letzte  Stück  ist,  was  ich  hier  sehe,  so  scheint  es,  mein \nEnthusiasmus  für  jene  Nationalrepräsentation  sollte  noch \ndurch  diese  Folie  erhöht  werden. \n\nNachdem  ich  zum  Schluß  mein  Tagebuch  durchgegangen, \nkleine  Schreibtafelbemerkungen  eingeschaltet,  so  sollen \ndie  Akten  inrotuliert  und  den  Freunden  zum  Urteils- \nspruch zugeschickt  werden.  Schon  jetzt  finde  ich  man- \nches in  diesen  Blättern,  das  ich  näher  bestimmen,  er- \nweitern und  verbessern  könnte;  es  mag  stehen  als  Denk- \nmal des  ersten  Eindrucks,  der,  wenn  er  auch  nicht  immer \nwahr  wäre,  uns  doch  köstlich  und  wert  bleibt.  Könnte \nich  nur  den  Freunden  einen  Hauch  dieser  leichtern  Exi- \nstenz hinübersenden!  Jawohl  ist  dem  Italiener  das  Ultra- \nmontane eine  dunkle  Vorstellung,  auch  mir  kommt  das \nJenseits  der  Alpen  nun  düster  vor;  doch  winken  freund- \nliche Gestalten  immer  aus  dem  Nebel.  Nur  das  Klima \nwürde  mich  reizen,  diese  Gegenden  jenen  vorzuziehen; \ndenn  Geburt  und  Gewohnheit  sind  mächtige  Fesseln.  Ich \nmöchte  hier  nicht  leben,  wie  überall  an  keinem  Orte,  wo  ich \nunbeschäftigt  wäre;  jetzt  macht  mir  das  Neue  unendlich \nviel  zu  Schäften.  Die  Baukunst  steigt  wie  ein  alter  Geist \naus  dem  Grabe  hervor,  sie  heißt  mich  ihre  Lehren,  wie \ndie  Regeln  einer  ausgestorbenen  Sprache,  studieren, \nnicht  um  sie  auszuüben  oder  mich  in  ihr  lebendig  zu \nerfreuen,  sondern  nur  um  die  ehrwürdige,  für  ewig  ab- \ngeschiedene Existenz  der  vergangenen  Zeitalter  in  einem \nstillen  Gemüte  zu  verehren.    Da  Palladio  alles  auf  Vitruv \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  103 \n\nbezieht,  so  habe  ich  mir  auch  die  Ausgabe  des  Galiani \nangeschaftt:  allein  dieser  Foliante  lastet  in  meinem  Ge- \npäck wie  das  Studium  desselben  auf  meinem  Gehirn. \nPalladio  hat  mir  durch  seine  Worte  und  Werke,  durch \nseine  Art  und  Weise  des  Denkens  und  Schaffens  den \nVitruv  schon  näher  gebracht  und  verdolmetscht,  besser \nals  die  italienische  Übersetzung  tun  kann.  Vitruv  liest \nsich  nicht  so  leicht;  das  Buch  ist  an  sich  schon  düster \ngeschrieben  und  fordert  ein  kritisches  Studium.  Dem- \nohngeachtet  lese  ich  es  flüchtig  durch,  und  es  bleibt  mir \nmancher  würdige  Eindruck.  Besser  zu  sagen:  ich  lese \nes  wie  ein  Brevier,  mehr  aus  Andacht  als  zur  Belehrung. \nSchon  bricht  die  Nacht  zeitiger  ein  und  gibt  Raum  zum \nLesen  imd  Schreiben. \n\nGott  sei  Dank,  wie  mir  alles  wieder  lieb  wird,  was  mir \nvon  Jugend  auf  wert  war!  Wie  glücklich  befinde  ich  mich, \ndaß  ich  den  alten  Schriftstellern  wieder  näher  zu  treten \nwage!  Denn  jetzt  darf  ich  es  sagen,  darf  meine  Krank- \nheit und  Torheit  bekennen.  Schon  einige  Jahre  her  dürft' \nich  keinen  lateinischen  Autor  ansehen,  nichts  betrachten, \nwas  mir  ein  Bild  Italiens  erneute.  Geschah  es  zufällig, \nso  erduldete  ich  die  entsetzlichsten  Schmerzen.  Herder \nspottete  oft  über  mich,  daß  ich  all  mein  Latein  aus  dem \nSpinoza  lerne;  denn  er  hatte  bemerkt,  daß  dies  das  einzige \nlateinische  Buch  war,  das  ich  las:  er  wußte  aber  nicht,  wie \nsehr  ich  mich  vor  den  Alten  hüten  mußte,  wie  ich  mich  in \njene  abstrusen  Allgemeinheiten  nur  ängstlich  flüchtete. \nNoch  zuletzt  hat  mich  die  Wielandsche  Übersetzung  der \nSatiren  höchst  unglücklich  gemacht:  ich  hatte  kaum  zwei \ngelesen,  so  war  ich  schon  verrückt. \nHätte  ich  nicht  den  Entschluß  gefaßt,  den  ich  jetzt  aus- \nführe, so  war'  ich  rein  zugrunde  gegangen:  zu  einer  sol- \nchen Reife  war  die  Begierde,  diese  Gegenstände  mit \nAugen  zu  sehen,  in  meinem  Gemüt  gestiegen.  Die  histo- \nrische Kenntnis  fördert  mich  nicht:  die  Dinge  standen \nnur  eine  Handbreit  von  mir  ab,  aber  durch  eine  undurch- \ndringliche Mauer  geschieden.  Es  ist  mir  wirklich  auch \njetzt  nicht  etwa  zumute,  als  wenn  ich  die  Sachen  zum \nerstenmal  sähe,  sondern  als  ob  ich  sie  wiedersähe.    Ich \n\n\nI04  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nbin  nur  kurze  Zeit  in  Venedig  und  habe  mir  die  hiesige \nExistenz  genugsam  zugeeignet  und  weiß,  daß  ich,  wenn \nauch  einen  unvollständigen,  doch  einen  ganz  klaren  und \nwahren  Begrifi\"  mit  wegnehme. \n\nVenedig,  den  14.  Oktober,  2  Stundeti  in  der  Nacht. \nIn  den  letzten  Augenblicken  meines  Hierseins:  denn  es \ngeht  sogleich  mit  dem  Kurierschifte  nach  Ferrara.  Ich \nverlasse  Venedig  gern;  denn  um  mit  Vergnügen  und \nNutzen  zu  bleiben,  müßte  ich  andere  Schritte  tun,  die \naußer  meinem  Plan  liegen;  auch  verläßt  jedermann  nun \ndiese  Stadt  und  sucht  seine  Garten  und  Besitzungen \nauf  dem  festen  Lande.  Ich  habe  indes  gut  aufgeladen \nund  trage  das  reiche,  sonderbare,  einzige  Bild  mit  mir \nfort. \n",

      "content": "Den 3. Oktober. Die Kirche Il Redentore, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will. Er war unzufrieden, wie ich aus gelinder Wendung seines Buches schließe, daß man bei christlichen Kirchen nach der Form der alten Basiliken zu bauen fortfahre, er suchte deshalb seine heiligen Gebäude der alten Tempelform zu nähern; daher entstanden gewisse Unschicklichkeiten, die mir bei Il Redentore glücklich beseitigt, bei St. Giorgio aber zu auffallend erscheinen. Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf. Inwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren.   Den 3. Oktober. Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen. Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.   Den 3. Oktober. Den Plan in der Hand suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld. Es wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.",

      "content": "**October 3rd.**\n\nThe morning air in Venice, though crisp, carried the familiar scent of salt and damp stone, a constant reminder of the city's unique embrace with the lagoon. I had spent a good part of the early hours studying Palladio’s collected works, Galiani’s heavy tome still weighing down my small table, but the true lesson, I found, was always in the stone and mortar itself. My path led me this day to the Redentore, a structure I had long admired in engravings.\n\nThe journey by gondola to the Giudecca was brief, yet it offered a fresh perspective on the city's grand, albeit aging, façade. As we glided across the wide stretch of water, the church of Il Redentore gradually revealed itself, a vision of classical purity rising from the very edge of the lagoon. Palladio, I reflected, was truly a master who understood the very essence of form and proportion. He was, as I had observed before, thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the ancients, and he felt the smallness and confinement of his own age like a great man unwilling to yield, striving instead to reshape the world as much as possible according to his noble concepts. He was dissatisfied, I concluded from the gentle turns of phrase in his writings, that Christian churches continued to be built in the form of the old basilicas. He sought, therefore, to bring his sacred edifices closer to the ancient temple form. From this ambition arose certain improprieties that, to my eye, were happily resolved in Il Redentore, though they appeared all too conspicuous in San Giorgio. Volkmann, in his travelogue, touches upon this, but, as is often the case with mere chroniclers, he misses the mark entirely.\n\nUpon disembarking, I paused, taking in the façade. Its harmonious lines, the interplay of its two superimposed temple fronts, spoke of a profound intellect. There was a dignified simplicity, a grandeur that transcended mere ornament. It was a testament to Palladio’s genius, an aspiration to the timeless beauty of antiquity, adapted with such grace to the demands of Christian worship.\n\nInside, Il Redentore was equally exquisite, every detail, even the design of the altars, conceived by Palladio himself. The light, filtered through high windows, illuminated the vast, serene space with a soft, ethereal glow. My eyes, however, were drawn to the niches, which, according to Palladio's original plans, should have been filled with statues. Instead, they proudly displayed flat, cut-out, painted board figures. This small, almost comical detail, spoke volumes of Venice's current plight. I imagined the original patrons, perhaps full of grand intentions, or perhaps, as the Republic's coffers slowly dwindled, a pragmatic compromise had been reached. Perhaps a local artisan, with a wink and a shrug, had offered this ingenious, cost-saving solution. \"Better a painted saint than an empty niche, *Signore*,\" I could almost hear him say, his hands gesturing with typical Italian vivacity. It was a charming, if slightly melancholic, sign of the times – a hint of the grand past meeting a less affluent present, where ingenuity sometimes replaced opulence.\n\nLater that afternoon, a different kind of ingenuity caught my attention. In honor of Saint Francis, the Capuchin Fathers had splendidly adorned a side altar. One saw nothing of stone save for the Corinthian capitals; everything else seemed covered in a tasteful, magnificent embroidery in the style of arabesques, so artfully done that one could wish for nothing more beautiful. I marveled especially at the broad, gold-embroidered tendrils and foliage, the intricate patterns that seemed to shimmer in the dim church light.\n\nDriven by a sculptor's curiosity, I approached closer, and there I discovered a rather charming deception. What I had taken for gold was, in fact, flattened straw, meticulously glued onto paper following exquisite designs. The background was painted in vibrant colors, all executed with such variety and taste that this playful piece, whose material was utterly without value and which was probably crafted within the monastery itself, would have cost several thousand Thalers had it been genuine. It was a testament to the monks' dedication and artistic flair, a way to create splendor from humility, to honor their saint with their own hands and wit, rather than with dwindling funds. It was a clever trick, one that, I mused, could occasionally be imitated with good effect elsewhere. The spirit of invention, even in such a small and unexpected detail, always pleased me.\n\nAs I made my way back towards the Grand Canal, the city's vibrant street life once again asserted itself. On an embankment overlooking the water, I had already on several occasions noticed a humble fellow recounting stories to a larger or smaller audience in the Venetian dialect. Today, I found him again, holding court near a cluster of fishing boats and market stalls. He was a man of perhaps fifty, his face weathered by the sun and sea, his hands expressive even when at rest. He wore simple, patched clothes, but carried himself with an almost theatrical dignity. His audience, mostly from the lowest classes – fishermen, porters, old women with baskets, and children – listened intently. I, unfortunately, could understand little of his rapid, melodic Venetian, yet I was captivated by his performance. No one laughed, I observed, only rarely did the audience offer a faint smile or a nod of recognition. The man himself had nothing striking or ridiculous about his manner; rather, he possessed a profound composure, coupled with an admirable variety and precision in his gestures, which clearly indicated both art and considerable reflection. It was not merely storytelling; it was a craft, honed over years, a living tradition that spoke directly to the soul of the Venetian common folk. He animated his tales with subtle shifts in posture, a raised eyebrow, a sudden sweep of his arm, painting vivid scenes in the minds of his listeners, even if the language remained a charming mystery to me.\n\nLater in the day, seeking another immersion into Venetian artistry, I took out my map and, with it in hand, navigated through the city’s most wondrous labyrinths until I found myself at the Church of the Mendicanti. Here, I knew, was the Conservatorio that currently enjoyed the most acclaim. The church was already filled with listeners, a hushed anticipation hanging in the air. The women, as was the custom, performed an oratorio from behind a grille, their voices soaring through the sacred space, beautiful beyond description. The music was exquisite, and the voices magnificent. An alto sang the role of King Saul, the protagonist of the poem. I had never conceived of such a voice; it possessed a depth and power that resonated through me. Some passages of the music were infinitely beautiful, and the text, though undeniably \"Italian Latin,\" was perfectly singable, so much so that one had to laugh at certain places for its charmingly direct and almost vernacular quality. The music, I realized, found a vast and fertile ground here, an expressive freedom that transcended the often-rigid forms of sacred composition.\n\nIt would have been a truly splendid enjoyment, had not the accursed Kapellmeister so impertinently beaten time against the grille with a roll of notes, as if he were dealing with schoolboys he was currently instructing. The girls, I knew, had rehearsed the piece many times; his clapping was entirely unnecessary and destroyed all impression, no differently than if one, in order to make a beautiful statue comprehensible to us, were to glue scarlet rags onto its joints. The foreign noise shattered all harmony. This man was a musician, yet he either did not hear it, or he desired, rather, that his presence should be perceived through this impropriety, when it would have been better had his worth been divined from the perfection of the performance itself. I know the French have this manner, but I would not have attributed it to the Italians, and yet the public seemed accustomed to it. It was not the only time, I reflected, that people allowed themselves to believe that what spoiled their enjoyment was, in fact, part of it. The sheer beauty of the voices, however, managed to shine through, a testament to their talent and the enduring power of the music itself, despite the conductor's grating intrusion.",

September  1786. \n\nDAS  Amphitheater  ist  also  das  erste  bedeutende  Monu- \nment der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  sehe,  tmd  so  gut  erhalten! \nAls  ich  hinein  trat,  mehr  noch  aber,  als  ich  oben  auf  dem \nRande  umher  ging,  schien  es  mir  seltsam,  etwas  Großes \nund  doch  eigentlich  nichts  zu  sehen.  Auch  will  es  leer \nnicht  gesehen  sein,  sondern  ganz  voll  von  Menschen,  wie \nman  es  neuerer  Zeit  Joseph  dem  Zweiten  und  Pius  dem \nSechsten  zu  Ehren  veranstaltet.  Der  Kaiser,  der  doch \nauch  Menschenmassen  vor  Augen  gewohnt  war,  soll  dar- \nüber erstaunt  sein.  Doch  nur  in  der  frühesten  Zeit  tat \nes  seine  ganze  Wirkung,  da  das  Volk  noch  mehr  Volk \nwar,  als  es  jetzt  ist.  Denn  eigentlich  ist  so  ein  Amphi- \ntheater recht  gemacht,  dem  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zu  impo- \nnieren, das  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zum  besten  zu  haben. \nWenn  irgend  etwas  Schauwürdiges  auf  flacher  Erde  vor- \ngeht und  alles  zuläuft,  suchen  die  Hintersten  auf  alle \nmögliche  Weise  sich  über  die  Vordersten  zu  erheben:  man \ntritt  auf  Bänke,  rollt  Fässer  herbei,  fährt  mit  Wagen \nheran,  legt  Bretter  hinüber  und  herüber,  besetzt  einen \nbenachbarten  Hügel,  und  es  bildet  sich  in  der  Geschwin- \ndigkeit ein  Krater. \n\nKommt  das  Schauspiel  öfter  auf  derselben  Stelle  vor,  so \nbaut  man  leichte  Gerüste  für  die,  so  bezahlen  können, \nund  die  übrige  Masse  behilft  sich,  wie  sie  mag.  Dieses \nallgemeine  Bedürfnis  zu  befriedigen,  ist  hier  die  Aufgabe \ndes  Architekten.  Er  bereitet  einen  solchen  Krater  durch \nKunst,  so  einfach  als  nur  möglich,  damit  dessen  Zierat \ndas  Volk  selbst  werde.  Wenn  es  sich  so  beisammen  sah, \nmußte  es  über  sich  selbst  erstaunen;  denn  da  es  sonst \nnur  gewohnt,  sich  durcheinander  laufen  zu  sehen,  sich  in \neinem  Gewühle  ohne  Ordnung  und  sonderliche  Zucht  zu \nfinden,  so  sieht  das  vielköpfige,  vielsinnige,  schwankende, \nhin  und  her  irrende  Tier  sich  zu  einem  edlen  Körper \nvereinigt,  zu  einer  Einheit  bestimmt,  in  eine  Masse \nverbunden  und  befestigt,  als  eine  Gestalt,  von  eijiem \nGeiste  belebt.    Die  Simplizität  des  Oval  ist  jedem  Auge \n\n\n44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  die  angenehmste  Weise  fühlbar,  und  jeder  Kopf  dient \nzum  Maße,  wie  ungeheuer  das  Ganze  sei.  Jetzt,  wenn \nman  es  leer  sieht,  hat  man  keinen  Maßstab,  man  weiß \nnicht,  ob  es  groß  oder  klein  ist. \n\nWegen  der  Unterhaltung  dieses  Werks  müssen  die  Vero- \nneser  gelobt  werden.  Es  ist  von  einem  rötlichen  Marmor \ngebaut,  den  die  Witterung  angreift;  daher  stellt  man  der \nReihe  nach  die  ausgefressenen  Stufen  immer  wieder  her, \nund  sie  scheinen  fast  alle  ganz  neu.  Eine  Inschrift  ge- \ndenkt eines  Hieronymus  Maurigenus  und  seines  auf  dieses \nMonument  verwendeten  unglaublichen  Fleißes.  Von  der \näußern  Mauer  steht  nur  ein  Stück,  und  ich  zweifele,  ob \nsie  je  ganz  fertig  geworden.  Die  untern  Gewölbe,  die  an \nden  großen  Platz,  II  Brä  genannt,  stoßen,  sind  an  Hand- \nwerker vermietet,  und  es  sieht  lustig  genug  aus,  diese \nHöhlungen  wieder  belebt  zu  sehen. \n\nDas  schönste,  aber  immer  geschlossene  Tor  heißt  Porta \nstuppa  oder  del  Pallio.  Als  Tor  und  in  der  großen  Ent- \nfernung, aus  der  man  es  schon  gewahr  wird,  ist  es  nicht \ngut  gedacht;  denn  erst  in  der  Nähe  erkennt  man  das \nVerdienst  des  Gebäudes. \n\nSie  geben  allerlei  Ursachen  an,  warum  es  geschlossen \nsei.  Ich  habe  jedoch  eine  Mutmaßung.  Die  Absicht  des \nKünstlers  ging  offenbar  dahin,  durch  dieses  Tor  eine  neue \nAnlage  des  Korso  zu  verursachen;  denn  auf  die  jetzige \nStraße  steht  es  ganz  falsch.  Die  linke  Seite  hat  lauter \nBaracken,  und  die  winkelrechte  Linie  der  Mitte  des  Tores \ngeht  auf  ein  Nonnenkloster  zu,  das  notwendig  hätte \nniedergelegt  werden  müssen.  Das  sah  man  wohl  ein,  auch \nmochten  die  Vornehmen  und  Reichen  nicht  Lust  haben, \nsich  in  dem  entfernten  Quartier  anzubauen.  Der  Künstler \nstarb  vielleicht,  und  so  schloß  man  das  Tor,  wodurch  die \nSache  nun  auf  einmal  geendigt  war. \n\nDas  Portal  des  Theatergebäudes,  von  sechs  großen  ioni- \nschen Säulen,  nimmt  sich  anständig  genug  aus.  Desto \nkleinlicher  erscheint  über  der  Türe,  vor  einer  gemalten \nNische,  die  von  zwei  korintliischen  Säulen  getragen  wird \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  45 \n\ndie  lebensgroße  Büste  des  Marchese  Maffei  in  einer \ngroßen  Perücke.  Der  Platz  ist  ehrenvoll,  aber  um  sich \ngegen  die  Größe  und  Tüchtigkeit  der  Säulen  einiger- \nmaßen zu  halten,  hätte  die  Büste  kolossal  sein  müssen. \nJetzt  steht  sie  kleinlich  auf  einem  Kragsteinchen,  unhar- \nmonisch mit  dem  Ganzen. \n\nAuch  die  Galerie,  die  den  Vorhof  einfaßt,  ist  kleinlich, \nund  die  kannelierten  dorischen  Zwerge  nehmen  sich  neben \nden  glatten  ionischen  Riesen  armselig  aus.  Doch  wollen \nwir  das  verzeihen  in  Betracht  der  schönen  Anstalt,  welche \nunter  diesen  Säulenlauben  angelegt  ist.  Hier  hat  man \ndie  Antiquitäten,  meist  in  und  um  Verona  gegraben,  ge- \nsammelt aufgestellt.  Einiges  soll  sogar  sich  im  Amphi- \ntheater gefunden  haben.  Es  sind  etrurische,  griechische, \nrömische,  bis  zu  den  niedern  Zeiten  und  auch  neuere. \nDie  Basreliefs  sind  in  die  Wände  eingemauert  und  mit \nden  Nummern  versehen,  die  ihnen  Maffei  gab,  als  er  sie \nin  seinem  Werke  Verona  illustrata  beschrieb.  Altäre, \nStücke  von  Säulen  und  dergleichen  Reste.  Ein  ganz  treff- \nlicher Dreifuß  von  weißem  Marmor,  worauf  Genien,  die \nsich  mit  den  Attributen  der  Götter  beschäftigen.  Raffael \nhat  dergleichen  in  den  Zwickeln  der  Farnesine  nachge- \nahmt und  verklärt. \n\nDer  Wind,  der  von  den  Gräbern  der  Alten  herweht, \nkommt  mit  Wohlgerüchen  wie  über  einen  Rosenhügel. \nDie  Grabmäler  sind  herzlich  und  rührend  und  stellen \nimmer  das  Leben  her.  Da  ist  ein  Mann,  der  neben  seiner \nFrau  aus  einer  Nische  wie  zu  einem  Fenster  heraussieht. \nDa  stehen  Vater  und  Mutter,  den  Sohn  in  der  Mitte,  ein- \nander mit  unaussprechlicher  Natürlichkeit  anblickend. \nHier  reicht  sich  ein  Paar  die  Hände.  Hier  scheint  ein \nVater,  auf  seinem  Sofa  ruhend,  von  der  Familie  unter- \nhalten zu  werden.  Mir  war  die  unmittelbare  Gegenwart \ndieser  Steine  höchst  rührend.  Von  späterer  Kunst  sind \nsie,  aber  einfach,  natürlich  und  allgemein  ansprechend. \nHier  ist  kein  geharnischter  Mann  auf  den  Knien,  der \neine  fröhliche  Auferstehung  erwartet.  Der  Künstler  hat \nmit  mehr  oder  weniger  Geschick  nur  die  einfache  Gegen- \nwart  der   Menschen  hingestellt,   ihre  Existenz  dadurch \n\n\n46  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfortgesetzt  und  bleibend  gemacht.  Sie  falten  nicht  die \nHände,  schauen  nicht  gen  Himmel,  sondern  sie  sind  hie- \nnieden,  was  sie  waren  und  was  sie  sind.  Sie  stehen  bei- \nsammen, nehmen  Anteil  aneinander,  lieben  sich;  und  das \nist  in  den  Steinen,  sogar  mit  einer  gewissen  Handwerks- \nunfähigkeit, allerliebst  ausgedrückt.  Ein  sehr  reich  ver- \nzierter marmorner  Pfeiler  gab  mir  auch  neue  Begriffe. \nSo  löblich  diese  Anstalt  ist,  so  sieht  man  ihr  doch  an, \ndaß  der  edle  Erhaltungsgeist,  der  sie  gegründet,  nicht \nmehr  in  ihr  fortlebt.  Der  kostbare  Dreifuß  geht  nächstens \nzugrunde,  weil  er  frei  steht,  gegen  Westen  der  Witterung \nausgesetzt.  Mit  einem  hölzernen  Futteral  wäre  dieser \nSchatz  leicht  zu  erhalten. \n\nDer  angefangene  Palast  des  Proveditore,  wäre  er  fertig \ngeworden,  hätte  ein  schön  Stück  Baukunst  gegeben.  Sonst \nbauen  die  Nobili  noch  viel,  leider  aber  ein  jeder  auf  den \nPlatz,  wo  seine  ältere  Wohnung  stand,  also  oft  in  engen \nGassen.  So  baut  man  jetzt  eine  prächtige  Fassade  eines \nSeminariums  in  einem  Gäßchen  der  entferntesten  Vor- \nstadt. \n\nAls  ich  mit  meinem  zufällig  aufgegriffenen  Begleiter  vor \neinem  großen  ernsthaften  Tore  eines  wunderbaren  Ge- \nbäudes vorüberging,  fragte  er  mich  gutmütig,  ob  ich  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  in  den  Hof  treten  wolle.  Es  war  der \nPalast  der  Justiz,  und  wegen  Höhe  der  Gebäude  erschien \nder  Hof  doch  nur  als  ein  ungeheurer  Brunnen.  Hier \nwerden,  sagte  er,  alle  die  Verbrecher  und  Verdächtigen \nverwahrt.  Ich  sah  umher,  und  durch  alle  Stockwerke \ngingen,  an  zahlreichen  Türen  hin,  offene  mit  eisernen \nGeländern  versehene  Gänge.  Der  Gefangene,  wie  er  aus \nseinem  Kerker  heraustrat,  um  zum  Verhör  geführt  zu \nwerden,  stand  in  der  freien  Tuft,  war  aber  auch  den \nBlicken  aller  ausgesetzt;  und  weil  nun  mehrere  Verhör- \nstuben sein  mochten,  so  klapperten  die  Ketten  bald  über \ndiesem,  bald  über  jenem  Gange  durch  alle  Stockwerke. \nEs  war  ein  verwünschter  Anblick,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \ndaß  der  gute  Humor,  womit  ich  meine  Vögel  abgefertigt \nhatte,  hier  doch  einen  etwas  schweren  Stand  würde  ge- \nfunden haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  47 \n\nIch  ging  auf  der  Kante  des  amphitheatralischen  Kraters \nbei  Sonnenuntergang,  der  schönsten  Aussicht  genießend \nüber  Stadt  und  Gegend.  Ich  war  ganz  allein,  und  unten \nauf  den  breiten  Steinen  des  Brä  gingen  Mengen  von \nMenschen,  Männer  von  allen  Ständen,  Weiber  vomMittel- \nstande  spazieren.  Diese  letztern  nehmen  sich  in  ihren \nschwarzen  Überkleidern,  aus  dieser  Vogelperspektive,  gar \nmumienhaft  aus. \n\nDer  Zendale  und  die  Veste,  die  dieser  Klasse  statt  aller \nGarderobe  dient,  ist  übrigens  eine  Tracht,  ganz  einge- \nrichtet für  ein  Volk,  das  nicht  immer  für  Reinlichkeit \nsorgen  und  doch  immer  ööentlich  erscheinen,  bald  in  der \nKirche,  bald  auf  dem  Spaziergange  sein  will.  Veste  ist \nein  schwarztaffeter  Rock,  der  über  andere  Röcke  gewor- \nfen wird.  Hat  das  Frauenzimmer  einen  reinlichen  weißen \ndarunter,  so  versteht  sie  den  schwarzen  an  der  einen  Seite \nin  die  Höhe  zu  heben.  Dieser  wird  so  angegürtet,  daß \ner  die  Taille  abschneidet  und  die  Lippen  des  Korsetts \nbedeckt,  welches  von  jeglicher  Farbe  sein  kann.  Der \nZendale  ist  eine  große  Kappe,  mit  langen  Barten,  die \nKappe  selbst  durch  ein  Drahtgestell  hoch  über  den  Kopf \ngehalten,  die  Barte  aber  wie  eine  Schärpe  um  den  Leib \ngeknüpft,  so  daß  die  Enden  hinterwärts  herunterfallen. \n\nAls  ich  heute  wieder  von  der  Arena  wegging,  kam  ich \neinige  tausend  Schritte  davon  zu  einem  modernen  ößent- \nlichen  Schauspiel.  Vier  edle  Veroneser  schlugen  Ball \ngegen  vier  Vicentiner.  Sie  treiben  dies  sonst  unter  sich \ndas  ganze  Jahr,  etwa  zwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht;  diesmal, \nwegen  der  fremden  Gegner,  lief  das  Volk  unglaublich  zu. \nEs  können  immer  vier-  bis  fünftausend  Zuschauer  ge- \nwesen sein.  Frauen  sah  ich  von  keinem  Stande. \nVorhin,  als  ich  vom  Bedürfnis  der  Menge  in  einem  sol- \nchen Falle  sprach,  hab'  ich  das  natürliche  zufällige  Am- \nphitaeater  schon  beschrieben,  wie  ich  das  Volk  hier  über- \neinander gebaut  sah.  Ein  lebhaftes  Händeklatschen  hört' \nich  schon  von  weiten,  jeder  bedeutende  Schlag  war  da- \nvon begleitet.  Das  Spiel  aber  geht  so  vor  sich:  In  ge- \nhöriger Entfernung  voneinander   sind   zwei   gelind  ab- \n\n\n4  3  ITA  1  JENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nliängige  Bretterflächen  errichtet.  Derjenige,  der  den  Ball \nausschlägt,  steht,  die  Rechte  mit  einem  hölzernen  breiten \nStachelringe  bewaffnet,  auf  der  obersten  Höhe.  Ir^dem \nnun  ein  anderer  von  seiner  Partei  ihm  den  r>all  zuwirft, \nso  läuft  er  herunter  dem  Ball  entgegen  und  vermehrt  da- \ndurch die  Gewalt  des  Schlages,  womit  er  denselben  zu \ntreffen  weiß.  Die  Gegner  suchen  ihn  zurückzuschlagen, \nund  so  geht  es  hin  und  wieder,  bis  er  zuletzt  im  Felde \nliegen  bleibt.  Die  schönsten  Stellungen,  wert,  in  Marmor \nnachgebildet  zu  werden,  kommen  dabei  zum  Vorschein. \nDa  es  lauter  wohlgewachsene,  rüstige,  junge  Leute  sind, \nin  kurzer,  knapper,  weißer  Kleidung,  so  unterscheiden \nsich  die  Parteien  nur  durch  ein  farbiges  Abzeichen.  Be- \nsonders schön  ist  die  Stellung,  in  welche  der  Ausschlagende \ngerät,  indem  er  von  der  schiefen  Fläche  herunter  läuft \nund  den  Ball  zu  treffen  ausholt;  sie  nähert  sich  der  des \nBorghesischen  Fechters. \n\nSonderbar  kam  es  mir  vor,  daß  sie  diese  Übung  an  einer \nnlten  Stadtmauer,  ohne  die  mindeste  Bequemlichkeit  für \ndie  Zuschauer,  vornehmen;  warum  sie  es  nicht  im  Amphi- \ntheater tun,  wo  so  schöner  Raum  wäre! \n\nDen  //.  September. \nWas  ich  von  Gemälden  gesehen,  will  ich  nur  kurz  be- \nrühren und  einige  Betrachtungen  hinzufügen.  Ich  mache \ndiese  wunderbare  Reise  nicht,  um  micli  selbst  zu  be- \ntrügen, sondern  um  mich  an  den  Gegenständen  kennen \nzu  lernen;  da  sage  ich  mir  denn  ganz  aufrichtig,  daß  ich \nvon  der  Kunst,  von  dem  Handwerk  des  Malers  wenig \nverstehe.  Meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  meine  Betrachtung \nkann  nur  auf  den  jiraktischen  Teil,  auf  den  Gegenstand \nund  auf  die  Behandlung  desselben  im  allgemeinen  ge- \nrichtet sein. \n\nSan  Giorgio  ist  eine  Galerie  von  guten  Gemälden,  alle \nAltarblätter,  wo  nicht  von  gleichem  Wert,  doch  duich- \naus  merkwürdig.  Aber  die  unglückseigen  Künstler,  was \nmußten  die  malen!  und  für  wen!  Ein  Mannaregen,  viel- \nleicht dreißig  Fuß  lang  und  zwanzig  hoch!  das  Wunder \nder  fünf  Brote  zum  Gegenstück!  was  war  daran  zu  malen: \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  49 \n\nHungrige  Menschen,  die  über  kleine  Körner  herfallen, \nunzählige  andere,  denen  Brot  präsentiert  wird.  Die \nKünstler  haben  sich  die  Folter  gegeben,  um  solche  Arm- \nseligkeiten bedeutend  zu  machen.  Und  doch  hat,  durch \ndiese  Nötigung  gereizt,  das  Genie  schöne  Sachen  hervor- \ngebracht. Ein  Künstler,  der  die  heilige  Ursula  mit  den \neilftausend  Jungfrauen  vorzustellen  hatte,  zog  sich  mit \ngroßem  Verstand  aus  der  Sache.  Die  Heilige  steht  im \nVordergrunde,  als  habe  sie  siegend  das  Land  in  Besitz \ngenommen;  sie  ist  sehr  edel,  amazonenhaft-jungfräulich, \nohne  Reiz  gebildet;  in  der  alles  verkleinernden  Ferne \nhingegen  sieht  man  ihre  Schar  aus  den  Schiften  steigen \nund  ia  Prozession  herankommen.  Die  Himmelfahrt  Maria \nim  Dom,  von  Tizian,  ist  sehr  verschwärzt,  der  Gedanke \nlobenswert,  daß  die  angehende  Göttin  nicht  himmel- \nwärts, sondern  herab  nach  ihren  Freunden  blickt. \nIn  der  Galerie  Gherardini  fand  ich  sehr  schöne  Sachen \nvon  Orbetto  und  lernte  diesen  verdienten  Künstler  auf \neinmal  kennen.  In  der  Entfernung  erfährt  man  nur  von \nden  ersten  Künstlern,  und  oft  begnügt  man  sich  mit  ihren \nNamen;  wenn  man  aber  diesem  Sternenhimmel  näher \ntritt  und  die  von  der  zweiten  und  dritten  Größe  nun  auch \nzu  flimmern  anfangen  und  jeder  auch  als  zum  ganzen \nSternbild  gehörend  hervortritt,  dann  wird  die  Welt  weit \nund  die  Kunst  reich.  Den  Gedanken  eines  Bildes  muß \nich  hier  loben.  Nur  zwei  Halbfiguren.  Simson  ist  eben \nim  Schöße  der  Delila  eingeschlafen,  sie  greift  leise  über \nihn  hinweg  nach  einer  Schere,  die  auf  dem  Tisch  neben \nder  Lampe  liegt.  Die  Ausfülirung  ist  sehr  brav.  Im \nPalast  Canossa  war  mir  eine  Danae  bemerklich. \nDer  Palast  Bevilacqua  enthält  die  köstlichsten  Sachen. \nEin  sogenanntes  Paradies  von  Tintorett,  eigentlich  aber \ndie  Krönung  der  Maria  zur  Himmelskönigin  in  Gegen- \nwart aller  Erzväter,  Propheten,  Apostel,  Heiligen,  Engel \nusw.,  eine  Gelegenheit,  den  ganzen  Reichtum  des  glück- \nlichsten Genies  zu  entwickeln.  Leichtigkeit  des  Pinsels, \nGeist,  Mannigfaltigkeit  des  Ausdrucks,  dies  alles  zu  be- \nwundern und  sich  dessen  zu  erfreuen,  müßte  man  das \nStück  selbst  besitzen  und  es  zeitlebens  vor  Augen  haben. \n\nGOETHE  IV  4 \n\n\n50  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  Arbeit  geht  ins  Unendliche,  ja  die  letzten  in  der \nGlorie  verschwindenden  Engelsköpfe  haben  noch  Cha- \nrakter. Die  größten  Figuren  mögen  einen  Fuß  hoch  sein, \nMaria  und  Christus,  der  ihr  die  Krone  aufsetzt,  etwa \nvier  Zoll.  Die  Eva  ist  doch  das  schönste  Weibchen  auf \ndem  Bilde  und  noch  immer  von  alters  her  ein  wenig \nlüstern. \n\nEin  paar  Porträte  von  Paul  Veronese  haben  meine  Hoch- \nachtung für  diesen  Künstler  nur  vermehrt.  Die  Antiken- \nsammlung ist  herrlich,  ein  hingestreckter  Sohn  der  Niobe \nköstlich,  die  Büsten,  ungeachtet  ihrer  restaurierten  Nasen, \nmeistens  höchst  interessant,  ein  August  mit  der  Bürger- \nkrone, ein  Caligula  und  andere. \n\nJ'ls  liegt  in  meiner  Natur,  das  Große  und  Schöne  willig \nund  mit  Freuden  zu  verehren,  und  diese  Anlage  an  so \nlaerrlichen  Gegenständen  Tag  für  Tag,  Stunde  für  Stunde \nauszubilden,  ist  das  seligste  aller  Gefühle. \nIn  einem  Lande,  wo  man  des  Tages  genießt,  besonders \naber  des  Abends  sich  erfreut,  ist  es  höchst  bedeutend, \nwenn  die  Nacht  einbricht.  Dann  hört  die  Arbeit  auf, \ndann  kehrt  der  Spaziergänger  zurück,  der  Vater  will  seine \nTochter  wieder  zu  Hause  sehen,  der  Tag  hat  ein  Ende; \ndoch  was  Tag  sei,  wissen  wir  Cimmerier  kaum.  In  ewi- \ngem Nebel  und  Trübe  ist  es  uns  einerlei,  ob  es  Tag  oder \nNacht  ist;  denn  wie  viel  Zeit  können  wir  uns  unter  freiem \nHimmel  wahrhaft  ergehen  und  ergötzen:  Wie  hier  die \nNacht  eintritt,  ist  der  Tag  entschieden  vorbei,  der  aus \nAbend  und  Morgen  bestand;  vierundzwanzig  Stunden  sind \nverlebt,  eine  neue  Rechnung  geht  an,  die  Glocken  läuten, \nder  Rosenkranz  wird  gebetet,  mit  brennender  Lampe  tritt \ndie  Magd  in  das  Zimmer  und  spricht:  Felicissima  nottc! \nDiese  Epoche  verändert  sich  mit  jeder  Jahreszeit,  und  der \nMensch,  der  hier  lebendig  lebt,  kann  nicht  irre  werden, \nweil  jeder  Genuß  seines  Daseins  sich  nicht  auf  die  Stunde, \nsondern  auf  die  Tageszeit  bezieht.  Zwänge  man  dem \nVolke  einen  deutschen  Zeiger  auf,  so  würde  man  es  ver- \nwirrt machen,  denn  der  seinige  ist  innigst  mit  seiner \nNatur  verwebt.  Anderthalb  Stunden,  eine  Stunde  vor \nNacht  fängt  der  Adel  an,  au.szufahren;   es  geht  auf  den \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  51 \n\nBrä,  die  lange  breite  Straße  nach  der  Porta  nuova  zu,  das \nTor  hinaus,  an  der  Stadt  hin,  und  wie  es  Nacht  schlägt, \nkehrt  alles  um.  Teils  fahren  sie  an  die  Kirchen,  das \nAve  Maria  della  sera  zu  beten,  teils  halten  sie  auf  dem \nBrä;  die  Kavaliers  treten  an  die  Kutschen,  unterhalten \nsich  mit  den  Damen,  und  das  dauert  eine  Weile,  ich  habe \ndas  Ende  niemals  abgewartet;  die  Fußgänger  bleiben \nweit  in  die  Nacht.  Heute  war  gerade  so  viel  Regen  nie- \ndergegangen, um  den  Staub  zu  löschen;  es  war  wirklich \nein  lebendiger,  munterer  Anblick. \n\nUm  mich  ferner  in  einem  wichtigen  Punkte  der  Landes- \ngewohnheit gleichzustellen,  habe  ich  mir  ein  Hilfsmittel \nerdacht,  wie  ich  ihre  Stundenrechnung  mir  leichter  zu \neigen  machte.  Nachfolgendes  Bild  kann  davon  einen  Be- \ngriff geben.  Der  innere  Kreis  bedeutet  unsere  vierund- \nzwanzig Stunden,  von  Mitternacht  zu  Mitternacht,  in \nzweimal  zwölf  geteilt,  wie  wir  zählen  und  unsere  Uhren \nsie  zeigen.  Der  mittlere  Kreis  deutet  an,  wie  die  Glocken \nin  der  jetzigen  Jahreszeit  hier  schlagen,  nämlich  gleich- \nfalls zweimal  bis  zwölf  in  vierundzwanzig  Stunden,  allein \ndergestalt,  daß  es  eins  schlägt,  wenn  es  bei  uns  acht \nschlüge,  und  so  fort,  bis  zwölfe  voll  sind.  Morgens  acht \nUhr  nach  unserm  Zeiger  schlägt  es  wieder  eins  usw.  Der \noberste  Kreis  zeigt  nun  endlich,  wie  bis  vierundzwanzig \nim  Leben  gezählt  wird.  Ich  höre  z.  B.  in  der  Nacht  sie- \nben schlagen  und  weiß,  daß  Mitternacht  um  fünf  ist,  so \nziehe  ich  diese  Zahl  von  jener  ab  und  habe  also  zwei \nUhr  Nachmitternacht.  Hör  ich  am  Tage  sieben  schlagen \nund  weiß,  daß  auch  Mittag  um  fünf  Uhr  ist,  so  verfahre \nich  ebenso  und  habe  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag.  Will  ich \naber  die  Stunden  nach  hiesiger  Weise  aussprechen,  so \nmuß  ich  wissen,  daß  Mittag  siebenzehn  Uhr  ist;  hiezu \nfüge  ich  noch  die  zwei  und  sage  neunzehn  Uhr.  Wenn \nman  dies  zum  erstenmal  hört  und  überdenkt,  so  scheint \nes  höchst  verworren  und  schwer  durchzuführen;  man  wird \nes  aber  gar  bald  gewohnt  und  findet  diese  Beschäftigung \nunterhaltend,  wie  sich  auch  das  Volk  an  dem  ewigen \nHin-  und  Widerrechnen  ergötzt,  wie  Kinder  an  leicht  zu \nüberwindenden    Schwierig-keiten.     Sie    haben    ohnedies \n\n\n52  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nimmer  die  Finger  in  der  Luft,  rechnen  alles  im  Kopfe \nund  machen  sich  gern  mit  Zahlen  zu  schaffen.  Ferner  ist \ndem  Inländer  die  Sache  so  viel  leichter,  weil  er  sich  um \nMittag  und  Mitternacht  eigentlich  nicht  bekümmert  und \nnicht,  wie  der  Fremde  in  diesem  Lande  tut,  zwei  Zeiger \nmiteinander  vergleicht.  Sie  zählen  nur  von  Abend  die \nStunden,  wie  sie  schlagen;  am  Tag  addieren  sie  die  Zahl \nzu  der  ihnen  bekannten  abwechselnden  Mittagszahl.  Das \nweitere  erläutern  die  der  Figur  beigefügten  Anmerkun- \ngen. (Siehe  das  nebenstehende  Blatt.) \nDas  Volk  rührt  sich  hier  sehr  lebhaft  durcheinander;  be- \nsonders in  einigen  Straßen,  wo  Kaufläden  und  Hand- \nwerksbuden aneinander  stoßen,  sieht  es  recht  lustig  aus. \nDa  ist  nicht  etwa  eine  Tür  vor  dem  Laden  oder  Arbeits- \nzimmer, nein,  die  ganze  Breite  des  Hauses  ist  often, \nman  sieht  bis  in  die  Tiefe  und  alles,  was  darin  vorgeht. \nDie  Schneider  nähen,  die  Schuster  ziehen  und  pochen \nalle  halb  auf  der  Gasse;  ja  die  Werkstätten  machen  einen \nTeil  der  Straße.  Abends,  wenn  Lichter  brennen,  sieht  es \nrecht  lebendig. \n\nAuf  den  Plätzen  ist  es  an  Markttagen  sehr  voll.  Gemüse \nund  Früchte  unübersehlich,  Knoblauch  und  Zwiebeln \nnach  Herzenslust.  Übrigens  schreien,  schäkern  und  singen \nsie  den  ganzen  Tag,  werfen  und  balgen  sich,  jauchzen \nund  lachen  unaufhörlich.  Die  milde  Luft,  die  wohlfeile \nNahrung  läßt  sie  leicht  leben.  Alles,  was  nur  kann,  ist \nunter  freiem  Himmel. \n\nNachts  geht  nun  das  Singen  und  Lärmen  recht  an.  Das \nLiedchen  von  Marlborough  hört  man  auf  allen  Straßen, \ndann  ein  Hackebrett,  eine  Violine.  Sie  üben  sich,  alle \nVögel  mit  Pfeifen  nachzumachen.  Die  wunderlichsten \nTöne  brechen  überall  hervor.  Ein  solches  Übergefühl  des \nDaseins  verleiht  ein  mildes  Klima  auch  der  Armut,  und \nder  Schatten  des  Volks  scheint  selbst  noch  ehrwürdig. \nDie  uns  so  sehr  auffallende  Unreinlichkeit  und  wenige \nBe(iuemlichkeit  der  Häuser  entspringt  auch  daher:  sie \nsind  immer  draußen,  und  in  ihrer  Sorglosigkeit  denken \nsie  an  nichts.  Dem  Volk  ist  alles  recht  und  gut;  der \nMittelmann  lebt  auch  von  einem  Tag  zum  andern;   der \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  53 \n\nVergleichlingskreis \n\nder  italienischen  und  deutschen  Uhr,  auch  der  italienischen \nZeiger  für  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  Septembers. \n\nM  i  1 1  a  ?. \n\n\nMitternacht. \n\nDi2  Nacht  wächst  mit  jedem  halben  Monat  eine  halbe  Stunde. \n\nMonat.

Ihre \nGesellschaften  halten  sie  in  öfifentlichen  Versammlungs- \nhiiusern.  Vorhöfe  und  Säulengänge  sind  alle  mit  Unrat \nbesudelt,  und  es  geht  ganz  natürlich  zu.  Das  Volk  fühlt \nsich  immer  vor.  Der  Reiche  kann  reich  sein,  Paläste \nbauen,  der  Nobile  darf  regieren,  aber  wenn  er  einen \nSäulengang,  einen  Vorhof  anlegt,  so  bedient  sich  das \nVolk  dessen  zu  seinem  Bedürfnis,  und  es  hat  kein  drin- \ngenderes, als  das  so  schnell  wie  möglich  loszuwerden, \nwas  es  so  häufig  als  möglich  zu  sich  genommen  hat.  Will \neiner  das  nicht  leiden,  so  muß  er  nicht  den  großen  Herrn \nspielen,  d.  h.  er  muß  nicht  tun,  als  wenn  ein  Teil  seiner \nWohnung  dem  Publikum  angehöre;  er  macht  seine  Türe \nzu,  und  so  ist  es  auch  gut.  An  öffentlichen  Gebäuden \nläßt  sich  das  Volk  sein  Recht  nun  gar  nicht  nehmen, \nund  das  ist's,  worüber  der  Fremde  durch  ganz  Italien \nBeschwerde  führt. \n\nIch  betrachtete  heut,  auf  mancherlei  Wegen  durch  die \nStadt,  die  Tracht  und  die  Manieren  besonders  des  Mittel- \nstandes, der  sich  sehr  häufig  und  geschäftig  zeigt.  Sie \nschlenkern  im  Gehen  alle  mit  den  Armen.  Personen  von \neinem  höhern  Stande,  die  bei  gewissen  Gelegenheiten \neinen  Degen  tragen,  schlenkern  nur  mit  ci/icm,  weil  sie \ngewohnt  sind,  den  linken  still  zu  halten. \nObgleich  das  Volk  seinen  Geschäften  und  Bedürfnissen \nsehr  sorglos  nachgeht,  so  hat  es  doch  auf  alles  Fremde \nein  scharfes  Auge.  So  könnt'  ich  die  ersten  Tage  be- \nmerken, daß  jedermann  meine  Stiefeln  betrachtete,  da \nman  sich  derselben  als  einer  feuern  Tracht  nicht  einmal \nim  Winter  bedient.  Jetzt,  da  ich  Schuh  und  Strümpfe \ntrage,  sieht  mich  niemand  mehr  an.  Aber  merkwürdig \nwar  mir's,  daß  heute  früh,  da  sie  alle  mit  Blumen,  Ge- \nmüse, Knoblauch  und  so  vielen  andern  Markterzeugnissen \ndurcheinander  liefen,  ihnen  der  Zypressenzweig  nicht  ent- \nging, den  ich  in  der  Hand  trug.  Einige  grüne  Zapfen \nhingen  daran,  und  daneben  hielt  ich  blühende  Kapem- \nzweige.  Sie  sahen  alle,  groß  und  klein,  mir  auf  die  Finger \nund  schienen  wunderliche  Gedanken  zu  haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  55 \n\nDiese  Zweige  bracht'  ich  aus  dem  Garten  Giusti,  der  eine \ntrefifliche  Lage  und  ungeheure  Zypressen  hat,  die  alle \npfriemenartig  in  die  Luft  stehen.  Wahrscheinlich  sind  die \nspitz  zugeschnittenen  Taxus  der  nordischen  Gartenkunst \nNachahmungen  dieses  herrlichen  Naturprodukts.  Ein \nBaum,  dessen  Zweige  von  unten  bis  oben,  die  ältesten \nwie  die  jüngsten,  gen  Himmel  streben,  der  seine  drei- \nhundert Jahre  dauert,  ist  wohl  der  Verehrung  wert.  Der \nZeit  nach,  da  der  Garten  angelegt  worden,  haben  diese \nschon  ein  so  hohes  Alter  erreicht. \n\nViccfiza,  den  ig.  Seftember. \nDer  Weg  von  Verona  hieher  ist  sehr  angenehm:  man  fährt \nnordostwärts  an  den  Gebirgen  hin  und  hat  die  Vorder- \nberge, die  aus  Sand,  Kalk,  Ton,  Mergel  bestehen,  immer \nlinker  Hand;  auf  den  Hügeln,  die  sie  bilden,  liegen  Orte, \nSchlösser,  Häuser.  Rechts  verbreitet  sich  die  weite  Fläche , \ndurch  die  man  fährt.  Der  gerade,  gut  unterhaltene,  breite \nWeg  geht  durch  fruchtbares  Feld;  man  blickt  in  tiefe  Baum- \nreihen, an  welchen  die  Reben  in  die  Höhe  gezogen  sind, \ndie  sodann,  als  wären  es  luftige  Zweige,  herunterfallen. \nHier  kann  man  sich  eine  Idee  von  Festonen  bilden!  Die \nTrauben  sind  zeitig  und  beschweren  die  Ranken,  die  lang \nund  schwankend  niederhängen.  Der  Weg  ist  voll  Menschen \naller  Art  und  Gewerbes;  besonders  freuten  mich  die  Wagen \nmit  niedrigen,  tellerartigen  Rädern,  die,  mit  vier  Ochsen \nbespannt,  große  Kufen  hin  und  wieder  führen,  in  welchen \ndie  Weintrauben  aus  den  Gärten  geholt  und  gestampft \nwerden.  Die  Führer  standen,  wenn  sie  leer  waren,  drinnen; \nes  sah  einem  Bacchischen  Triumphzug  ganz  ähnlich. \nZwischen  den  Weinreihen  ist  der  Boden  zu  allerlei  Arten \nGetreide,  besonders  zu  Türkischkorn  und  Sörgel  benutzt. \nKommt  man  gegen  Vicenza,  so  steigen  wieder  Hügel  von \nNorden  nach  Süden  auf — sie  sind  vulkanisch,  sagt  man \n— und  schließen  die  Ebene.  Vicenza  liegt  an  ihrem  Fuße \nund,  wenn  man  will,  in  einem  Busen,  den  sie  bilden. \n\nVor  einigen  Stunden  bin  ich  hier  angekommen,  habe  schon \ndie  Stadt  durchlaufen,  das  Olympische  Theater  und  die \n\n\n5  6  ITALTENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nGebäude  des  Palladio  gesehen.  Man  hat  ein  sehr  artiges \n]5üchelchen  mit  Kupfern  zur  Bequemlichkeit  der  Fremden \nherausgegeben,  mit  einem  kunstverständigen 'I'exte.  Wenn \nman  nun  diese  Werke  gegenwärtig  sieht,  so  erkennt  man \nerst  den  großen  Wert  derselben:  denn  sie  sollen  ja  durch \nilire  wirkliche  Größe  und  Körperlichkeit  das  Auge  füllen \nund  durch  die  schöne  Harmonie  ihrer  Dimensionen  nicht \nnur  in  abstrakten  Aufrissen,  sondern  mit  dem  ganzen  per- \nspektivischen Vordringen  und  Zurückweichen  den  Geist \nbefriedigen;  und  so  sag'  ich  vom  Palladio:  er  ist  ein  recht \ninnerlich  und  von  innen  heraus  großer  Mensch  gewesen. \nDie  höchste  Schwierigkeit,  mit  der  dieser  Mann,  wie  alle \nneuern  Architekten,  zu  kämpfen  hatte,  ist  die  schickliche \nAnwendung  der  Säulenordnungen  in  der  bürgerlichen  Bau- \nkunst: denn  Säulen  und  Mauern  zu  verbinden,  bleibt  doch \nimmer  ein  Widerspruch.  Aber  wie  er  das  untereinander \ngearbeitet  hat,  wie  er  durch  die  Gegenwart  seiner  Werke \nimponiert  und  vergessen  macht,  daß  er  nur  überredet!  Es \nist  wirklich  etwas  Göttliches  in  seinen  Anlagen,  völlig  wie \ndie  Force  des  großen  Dichters,  der  aus  Walu-heit  und \nLüge  ein  Drittes  bildet,  dessen  erborgtes  Dasein  uns  be- \nzaubert. \n\nDas  Olympische  Theater  ist  ein  Theater  der  Alten,  im \nkleinen  realisiert,  und  unaussprechlich  schön,  aber  gegen \ndie  unsrigen  kömmt  mir's  vor  wie  ein  vornehmes,  reiches, \nwohlgebildetes  Kind  gegen  einen  klugen  Wcltmenschen, \nder,  weder  so  vornehm  noch  so  reich,  noch  wohlgebildet, \nbesser  weiß,  was  er  mit  seinen  Mitteln  bewirken  kann. \nBeti-achtet  man  nun  hier  am  Orte  die  herrlichen  Gebäude, \ndie  jener  Mann  auffiihrte,  und  sieht,  wie  sie  schon  durch \ndas  enge  schmutzige  Bedürfnis  der  Menschen  entstellt \nsind,  wie  die  Anlagen  meist  über  die  Kräfte  der  Unter- \nnehmer Avaren,  wie  wenig  diese  köstlichen  Denkmale  eines \nhohen  Menschengeistes  zu  dem  Leben  der  übrigen  passen, \nso  fällt  einem  denn  doch  ein,  daß  es  in  allem  andern  eben- \nso ist:  denn  man  verdient  wenig  Dank  von  den  Menschen, \nwenn  man  ihr  inneres  Bedürfnis  erhöhen,  ihnen  eine  große \nIdee  von  ihnen  selbst  geben,  ihnen  das  Herrliche  eines \nwahren  edlen  Daseins  zum  Gefühl  bringen  will.     Aber \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  57 \n\nwenn  man  die  Vögel  belügt,  Märchen  erzählt,  von  Tag  zu \nTag  ihnen  forthelfend  sie  verschlechtert,  da  ist  man  ihr \nMann,  imd  darum  gefällt  sich  die  neuere  Zeit  in  so  viel \nAbgeschmacktem.  Ich  sage  das  nicht,  um  meine  Freunde \nherunterzusetzen,  ich  sage  nur,  daß  sie  so  sind  und  daß \nman  sich  nicht  verwundern  muß,  wenn  alles  ist,  wie \nes  ist. \n\nWie  sich  die  Basilika  des  Palladio  neben  einem  alten,  mit \nungleichen  Fenstern  übersäten,  kastellähnhchen  Gebäude \nausnimmt,  welches  der  Baumeister  zusamt  dem  Turm \ngewiß  weggedacht  hat,  ist  nicht  auszudrücken,  und  ich \nmuß  mich  schon  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  zusammen- \nfassen: denn  ich  finde  auch  hier — leider  gleich!  —  das, \nwas  ich  fliehe  und  suche,  nebeneinander. \n\nDen  20.  September. \nGestern  war  Oper,  sie  dauerte  bis  nach  Mitternacht,  und \nich  sehnte  mich  zu  ruhen.  \"Die  drei  Sultaninnen\"  und  \"Die \nEntführung  aus  dem  Serail\"  haben  manche  Fetzen  her- \ngegeben, woraus  das  Stück  mit  weniger  Klugheit  zu- \nsammengeflickt ist.  Die  Musik  hört  sich  bequem  an,  ist \naber  wahrscheinlich  von  einem  Liebhaber;  kein  neuer \nGedanke,  der  mich  getroffen  hätte.  Die  Ballette  dagegen \nsind  allerliebst.  Das  Hauptpaar  tanzte  eine  Allemande, \ndaß  man  nichts  Zierlicheres  sehen  konnte. \nDas  Theater  ist  neu,  lieblich,  schön,  modest-prächtig, \nalles  uniform,  wie  es  einer  Provinzialstadt  geziemt;  jede \nLoge  hat  ihren  übergeschlagenen,  gleichfarbigen  Teppich, \ndie  des  Capitan  Grande  ist  nur  durch  einen  etwas  längern \nÜberhang  ausgezeichnet. \n\nDie  erste  Sängerin,  vom  ganzen  Volke  sehr  begünstigt, \nwird,  wie  sie  auftritt,  entsetzlich  beklatscht,  und  die  Vögel \nstellen  sich  vor  Freuden  ganz  ungebärdig,  wenn  sie  etwas \nrecht  gut  macht,  welches  sehr  oft  geschieht.  Es  ist  ein \nnatürlich  Wesen,  hübsche  Figur,  schöne  Stimme,  ein  ge- \nfällig Gesicht  und  von  einem  recht  honetten  Anstand;  in \nden  Armen  könnte  sie  etwas  mehr  Grazie  haben.  In- \ndessen komme  ich  denn  doch  nicht  wieder;  ich  fühle,  daß \nich  zum  Vogel  verdorben  bin. \n\n\n58  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  21 .  September. \nHeute  besuchte  ich  Dr.  Turra;  wohl  fünf  Jahre  hat  er  sich \nmit  Leidenschaft  auf  die  Pflanzenkunde  gelegt,  ein  Herba- \nrium der  italienischen  Flora  gesammelt,  unter  dem  vorigen \nBischof  einen  botanischen  Garten  eingerichtet.  Das  ist \naber  alles  hin.  Medizinische  Praxis  vertrieb  die  Natur- \ngeschichte, das  Herbarium  wird  von  Würmern  gespeist, \nder  Bischof  ist  tot,  und  der  botanische  Garten  wieder, \nwie  billig,  mit  Kohl  und  Knoblauch  bepflanzt. \nDr.  Turra  ist  ein  gar  feiner  guter  Mann.  Er  erzählte  mir \nmit  Offenheit,  Seelenreinheit  und  Bescheidenheit  seine \nGeschichte  und  sprach  überhaupt  sehr  bestimmt  und  ge- \nfällig, hatte  aber  nicht  Lust,  seine  Schränke  aufzutun,  die \nvielleicht  in  keinem  präsentablen  Zustande  sein  mochten. \nDer  Diskurs  kam  bald  ins  Stocken. \n\nAbends. \nIch  ging  zum  alten  I'aumeister  Scamozzi,  der  des  Palladio \nGebäude  herausgegeben  hat  und  ein  wackerer,  leiden- \nschaftlicher Künstler  ist.  Er  gab  mir  einige  Anleitung, \nvergnügt  über  meine  Teilnahme.  Unter  den  Gebäuden \ndes  Palladio  ist  eins,  für  das  ich  immer  eine  besondere \nVorliebe  hatte,  es  soll  seine  eigne  Wohnung  gewesen  sein; \naber  in  der  Nähe  ist  es  weit  mehr,  als  man  im  Bilde  sieht. \nIch  möchte  es  gezeichnet  und  mit  den  Farben  illuminiert \nhaben,  die  ihm  das  Material  und  das  Alter  gegeben.  Man \nmuß  aber  nicht  denken,  daß  der  Baumeister  sich  einen \nPalast  errichtet  habe.  Es  ist  das  bescheidenste  Haus  von \nder  Welt,  hat  nur  zwei  Fenster,  die  durch  einen  breiten \nRaum,  der  das  dritte  Fenster  vertrüge,  abgesondert  sind. \nWollte  man  es  zumCiemälde  nachbilden,  so  daß  die  Nach- \nbarhäuser mit  vorgestellt  würden,  so  wäre  auch  das  ver- \ngnüglich anzusehen,  wie  es  zwischen  sie  eingeschaltet  ist. \nDas  hätte  Canaletto  malen  sollen. \n\nHeute  besuchte  ich  das  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  der  Stadt \nauf  einer  angenehmen  Höhe  liegende  Prachthaus,  die \nRotonda  genannt.  Es  ist  ein  viereckiges  Gebäude,  das \neinen  runden,  von  oben  erleuchteten  Saal  in  sich  schließt. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  59 \n\nVon  allen  vier  Seiten  steigt  man  auf  breiten  Treppen \nhinan  und  gelangt  jedesmal  in  eine  Vorhalle,  die  von \nsechs  korinthischen  Säulen  gebildet  wird.  Vielleicht  hat \ndie  Baukunst  iliren  Luxus  niemals  höher  getrieben.  Der \nRaum,  den  die  Treppen  und  Vorhallen  einnehmen,  ist \nviel  größer  als  der  des  Hauses  selbst;  denn  jede  einzelne \nSeite  würde  als  Ansicht  eines  Tempels  befriedigen.  In- \nwendig kann  man  es  wohnbar,  aber  nicht  wohnlich \nnennen.  Der  Saal  ist  von  der  schönsten  Proportion,  die \nZimmer  auch;  aber  zu  den  Bedürfnissen  eines  Sommer- \naufenthalts einer  vornehmen  Familie  würden  sie  kaum \nhinreichen.  Dafür  sieht  man  es  auch  in  der  ganzen  Gegend, \nvon  allen  Seiten,  sich  auf  das  herrlichste  darstellen.  Die \nMannigfaltigkeit  ist  groß,  in  der  sich  seine  Hauptmasse \nzugleich  mit  den  vorspringenden  Säulen  vor  dem  Auge \nder  Umherwandelnden  bewegt,  und  die  Absicht  des  Be- \nsitzers ist  vollkommen  erreicht,  der  ein  großes  Fidei- \nkommißgut  und  zugleich  ein  sinnliches  Denkmal  seines \nVermögens  hinterlassen  wollte.  Und  wie  nun  das  Ge- \nbäude von  allen  Punkten  der  Gegend  in  seiner  Herrlich- \nkeit gesehen  wird,  so  ist  die  Aussicht  von  daher  gleich- \nfalls die  angenehmste.  Man  sieht  den  Bachiglione  fließen, \nSchifte  von  Verona  herab  gegen  die  Brenta  führend;  dabei \nüberschaut  man  die  weiten  Besitzungen,  welche  Marchese \nCapra  unzertrennt  bei  seiner  Familie  erhalten  wollte.  Die \nInschriften  der  vier  Giebelseiten,  die  zusammen  eine \nganze  ausmachen,  verdienen  wohl  aufgezeichnet  zu  werden: \nMarcus  Capra  Gabrielis  filius \nqui  aedes  has \narctissimo  primogeniturae  gradui  subjecit \nuna  cum  Omnibus \ncensibus  agris  vallibus  et  collibus \n\ncitra  viam  magnam \nmemoriae  perpetuae  mandans  haec \ndum  sustinet  ac  abstinet. \nDer  Schluß  besonders  ist  seltsam  genug:  ein  Mann,  dem \nso  viel  Vermögen  und  Wille  zu  Gebote  stand,  fühlt  noch, \ndaß  er  dulden  und  entbehren  müsse.    Das  kann  man  mit \ngerinsferm  Aufwand  lernen. \n\n\n6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  22.  September. \nHeute  abend  war  ich  in  einer  Versammlung,  welche  die \nAkademie  der  Olympier  hielt.  Ein  Spielwerk,  aber  ein \nrecht  gutes;  es  erhält  noch  ein  bißchen  Salz  und  Leben \nunter  den  Leuten.  Ein  großer  Saal  neben  dem  Theater \ndes  Palladio,  anständig  erleuchtet,  der  Capitan  und  ein \nTeil  des  Adels  zugegen,  übrigens  durchaus  ein  Publikum \nvon  gebildeten  Personen,  viele  Geistliche,  zusammen  ohn- \ngefähr  fünfhundert. \n\nDie  von  dem  Präsidenten  für  die  heutige  Sitzung  auf- \ngegebene Frage  war:  ob  Erfindung  oder  Nachahmung  den \nschönen  Künsten  melir  Vorteil  gebracht  habe?  Der  Ein- \nfall war  glücklich  genug;  denn  wenn  man  die  in  der  Frage \nliegende  Alternative  trennt,  so  läßt  sich  hundert  Jahre \nhinüber  und  herüber  sprechen.  Auch  haben  sich  die \nHerrn  Akademiker  dieser  Gelegenheit  weidlich  bedient \nund  in  Prosa  und  Versen  mancherlei  hervorgebracht,  wor- \nunter viel  Gutes. \n\nSodann  ist  es  das  lebendigste  Publikum.  Die  Zuhörer \nriefen  bravo,  klatschten  und  lachten.  Wenn  man  auch \nvor  seiner  Nation  so  stehen  und  sie  persönlich  belustigen \ndürfte!  Wir  geben  unser  Bestes  schwarz  auf  weiß:  jeder \nkauzt  sich  damit  in  eine  Ecke  und  knopert  daran,  wie  er \nkann. \n\nEs  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  Palladio  auch  diesmal  an  allen \nOrten  und  Enden  war,  es  mochte  vom  Erfinden  oder \nNachahmen  die  Rede  sein.  Zuletzt,  wo  immer  das  Scherz- \nliafteste  gefordert  wird,  hatte  einer  den  glücklichen  Ein- \nfall, zu  sagen:  die  andern  hätten  ihm  den  Palladio  weg- \ngenommen, er  wolle  dagegen  den  Franceschini  loben, \nden  großen  Seidenfabrikanten.  Nun  fing  er  an,  zu  zeigen, \nwas  die  Nachahmung  der  Lyoner  und  Florentiner  Stoffe \ndiesem  tüchtigen  Unternehmer  und  durch  ihn  der  Stadt \nVicenza  für  Vorteil  gebracht  habe,  woraus  erfolge,  daß \ndie  Nachahmung  weit  über  die  Erfindung  erhaben  sei. \nUnd  dies  geschah  mit  so  gutem  Humor,  daß  ein  ununter- \nbrochenes Gelächter  erregt  ward.  Überhaupt  fanden  die, \nwelche  für  die  Nachahmung  sprachen,  mehr  Beifall;  denn \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  61 \n\nsie  sagten  lauter  Dinge,  wie  sie  der  Haufen  denkt  und \ndenken  kann.  Einmal  gab  das  Publikum  mit  großem \nHändeklatschen  einem  recht  groben  Sophism  seinen  herz- \nlichen Beifall,  da  es  viele  gute,  ja  treffliche  Sachen  zu \nEhren  der  Erfindung  nicht  gefühlt  hatte.  Es  freut  mich \nsehr,  auch  dieses  erlebt  zu  haben,  und  dann  ist  es  höchst \nerquickend,  den  Palladio  nach  so  viel  Zeit  immer  noch \nals  Polarstern  und  Musterbild  von  seinen  Mitbürgern  ver- \nehrt zu  sehen. \n\nVicenza^  den  23.  September. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  in  Tiene,  das  nordwärts  gegen  die \nGebirge  liegt,  wo  ein  neu  Gebäude  nach  einem  alten \nRisse  aufgeführt  wird,  wobei  wenig  zu  erinnern  sein \nmöchte.  So  ehrt  man  hier  alles  aus  der  guten  Zeit  und \nhat  Sinn  genug,  nach  einem  geerbten  Plan  ein  frisches \nGebäude  aufzuführen.  Das  Schloß  liegt  ganz  trefilich  in \neiner  großen  Plaine,  die  Kalkalpen  ohne  Zwischengebirg \nhinter  sich.  Vom  Gebäude  her,  neben  der  schnurgeraden \nChaussee,  fließt  zu  beiden  Seiten  lebendiges  Wasser  dem \nKommenden  entgegen  und  wässert  die  weiten  Reisfelder, \ndurch  die  man  fährt. \n\nIch  habe  nun  erst  die  zwei  italienischen  Städte  gesehen \nund  mit  wenig  Menschen  gesprochen,  aber  ich  kenne \nmeine  Italiener  schon  gut.  Sie  sind  wie  Hofleute,  die \nsich  fürs  erste  Volk  in  der  Welt  halten  und  bei  gewissen \nVorteilen,  die  man  ihnen  nicht  leugnen  kann,  sich's  un- \ngestraft und  bequem  einbilden  können.  Mir  erscheinen  die \nItaliener  als  eine  recht  gute  Nation:  man  muß  nur  die \nKinder  und  die  gemeinen  Leute  sehen,  wie  ich  sie  jetzt \nsehe  und  sehen  kann,  da  ich  ihnen  immer  ausgesetzt  bin \nund  mich  ihnen  immer  aussetze.  Und  was  das  für  Figuren \nund  Gesichter  sind! \n\nBesonders  muß  ich  die  Vicentiner  loben,  daß  man  bei \nihnen  die  Vorrechte  einer  großen  Stadt  genießt.  Sie  sehen \neinen  nicht  an,  man  mag  machen,  was  man  will;  wendet \nman  sich  jedoch  an  sie,  dann  sind  sie  gesprächig  und  an- \nmutig, besonders  wollen  mir  die  Frauen  sehr  gefallen. \nDie  Veroneserinnen  will  ich  nicht  schelten,  sie  haben  eine \n\n\n62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngute  Bildung  und  entschiedeneProfile;  aber  meistens  bleich, \nund  der  Zendal  tut  ihnen  Schaden,  weil  man  unter  der \nschönen  Tracht  auch  etwas  Reizendes  sucht.  Hier  aber \nfinde  ich  gar  hübsche  Wesen,  besonders  eine  schwarz- \nlockige Sorte,  die  mir  ein  eigenes  Interesse  einflößt.  Es \ngibt  auch  noch  eine  blonde,  die  mir  aber  nicht  so  be- \nhagen will. \n\nPadiia^  den  26.  September  abends. \nIn  vier  Stunden  bin  ich  heute  von  Vicenza  herübergefahren, \nauf  ein  einsitziges  Chaischen,  Sediola  genannt,  mit  meiner, \nganzen  Existenz  gepackt.  Man  fährt  sonst  bequem  in  viert- \nhalb Stunden;  da  ich  aber  den  köstlichen  Tag  gern  unter \nfreiem  Himmel  genießen  wollte,  so  war  es  mir  angenehm, \ndaß  der  Vetturin  hinter  seiner  Schuldigkeit  zurückblieb. \nMan  fährt  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Ebene  immer  südostwärts, \nzwischen  Hecken  und  Bäumen,  ohne  weitere  Aussicht,  bis \nman  endlich  die  schönen  Gebirge,  von  Norden  gegen \nSüden  streichend,  zur  rechten  Hand  sieht.  Die  Fülle  der \nPflanzen-  und  Fruchtgehänge,  über  Mauern  und  Hecken, \nan  Bäumen  herunter,  ist  unbesclireiblich.  Kürbisse  be- \nschweren die  Dächer,  und  die  wunderlichsten  Gurken \nhängen  an  Latten  und  Spalieren. \n\nDie  herrliche  Lage  der  Stadt  konnte  ich  vom  Observa- \ntorium aufs  klarste  überschauen.  Gegen  Norden  Tiroler \nGebirge,  beschneit,  in  Wolken  halb  versteckt,  an  die \nsich  in  Nordwest  die  Vicentinischen  anschließen,  endlich \ngegen  Westen  die  näheren  Gebirge  von  Este,  deren  Ge- \nstalten und  Vertiefungen  man  deutlich  sehen  kann.  Gegen \nSüdost  ein  grünes  Pflanzenmeer,  ohne  eine  Spur  von \nErhöhung,  Baum  an  Baum,  Busch  an  Busch,  Pflanzung \nan  Pflanzung,  unzählige  weiße  Häuser,  Villen  und  Kirchen \naus  dem  Grünen  hervorblickend.  Am  Horizont  sah  ich \nganz  deutlich  den  Markusturm  zu  Venedig  und  andere \ngeringere  Türme. \n\nFadi/a^  den  27.  September. \nEndlich  hab'  ich  die  Werke  des  Palladio  erlangt,  zwar \nnicht  die  Originalausgabe,  die  ich  in  Vicenza  gesehen, \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  St, \n\nderen  Tafeln  in  Holz  geschnitten  sind,  aber  eine  genaue \nKopie,  ja  ein  Faksimile  in  Kupfer,  veranstaltet  durch  einen \nvortrefflichen  Mann,  den  ehemaligen  englischen  Konsul \nSmith  in  Venedig.  Das  muß  man  den  Engländern  lassen, \ndaß  sie  von  lange  her  das  Gute  zu  schätzen  wußten \nund  daß  sie  eine  grandiose  Art  haben,  es  zu  verbreiten. \nBei  Gelegenheit  dieses  Ankaufs  betrat  ich  einen  Buch- \nladen, der  in  Italien  ein  ganz  eigenes  Ansehen  hat.  Alle \nBücher  stehen  geheftet  umher,  und  man  findet  den  ganzen \nTag  über  gute  Gesellschaft.  Was  von  Weltgeistlichen, \nEdelleuten,  Künstlern  einigermaßen  mit  der  Literatur \nverwandt  ist,  geht  hier  auf  und  ab.  Man  verlangt  ein \nBuch,  schlägt  nach,  liest  und  unterhält  sich,  wie  es  kommen \nwill.  So  fand  ich  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  beisammen, \nwelche  sämtlich,  als  ich  nach  den  Werken  des  Palladio \nfragte,  auf  mich  aufmerksam  wurden.  Indes  der  Herr  des \nLadens  das  Buch  suchte,  rühmten  sie  es  und  gaben  mir \nNotiz  von  dem  Originale  und  der  Kopie;  sie  waren  mit \ndem  Werke  selbst  und  dem  Verdienst  des  Verfassers \nsehr  wohl  bekannt.  Da  sie  mich  für  einen  Architekten \nhielten,  lobten  sie  mich,  daß  ich  vor  allen  andern  zu  den \nStudien  dieses  Meisters  schritte;  er  leiste  zu  Gebrauch \nund  Anwendung  mehr  als  Vitruv  selbst,  denn  er  habe \ndie  Alten  und  das  Altertum  gründlich  studiert  und  es \nunsern  Bedürfnissen  näher  zu  führen  gesucht.  Ich  unter- \nhielt mich  lange  mit  diesen  freundlichen  Männern,  er- \nfuhr noch  einiges,  die  Denkwürdigkeiten  der  Stadt  be- \ntreffend, und  empfahl  mich. \n\nDa  man  denn  doch  einmal  den  Heiligen  Kirchen  gebaut \nhat,  so  findet  sich  auch  wohl  darin  ein  Platz,  wo  man \nvernünftige  Menschen  aufstellen  kann.  Die  Büste  des \nKardinals  Bembo  steht  zwischen  ionischen  Säulen,  ein \nschönes,  wenn  ich  so  sagen  soll  mit  Gewalt  in  sich  ge- \nzogenes Gesicht  und  ein  mächtiger  Bart;  die  Inschrift \nlautet: \n\nPetri  Bembi  Card,  imaginem  Hier.  Guerinus  Ismeni  f.  in \n\npublico  ponendam  curavit  ut  cujus  ingenii  monumenta \n\naeterna  sint  ejus  corporis  quoque  memoria  ne  a  poste- \n\nritate  desideretur. \n\n\n64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDas  Universitätsgebäude  hat  mich  mit  aller  seiner  Würde \nerschreckt.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  darin  nichts  zu  lernen \nhatte.  Eine  solche  Schulenge  denkt  man  sich  nicht,  ob \nman  gleich  als  Studiosus  deutscher  Akademien  auf  den \nHörbänken  auch  manches  leiden  müssen.  Besonders  ist \ndas  anatomische  Theater  ein  Muster,  wie  man  Schüler \nzusammenpressen  soll.  In  einem  spitzen  hohen  Trichter \nsind  die  Zuhörer  übereinander  geschichtet.  Sie  sehen \nsteil  herunter  auf  den  engen  Boden,  wo  der  Tisch  steht, \nauf  den  kein  Licht  fällt;  deshalb  der  Lehrer  bei  Lampen- \nschein demonstrieren  muß.  Der  botanische  Garten  ist \ndesto  artiger  und  munterer.  Es  können  viele  Pflanzen \nauch  den  Winter  im  Lande  bleiben,  wenn  sie  an  Mauern \noder  nicht  weit  davon  gesetzt  sind.  Man  überbaut  als- \ndann das  Ganze  zu  Ende  des  Oktobers  und  heizt  die \nwenigen  Monate.  Es  ist  erfreuend  und  belehrend,  unter \neiner  Vegetation  umherzugehen,  die  uns  fremd  ist.  Bei \ngewohnten  Pflanzen,  sowie  bei  andern  längst  bekannten \nGegenständen,  denken  wir  zuletzt  gar  nichts;  und  was  ist \nBeschauen  ohne  Denken?  Hier  in  dieser  neu  mir  ent- \ngegentretenden Mannigfaltigkeit  wird  jener  Gedanke \nimmer  lebendiger,  daß  man  sich  alle  Pflanzengestalten \nvielleicht  aus  ei7icr  entwickeln  könne.  Hierdurch  würde \nes  allein  möglich  werden,  Geschlechter  und  Arten  wahr- \nhaft zu  bestimmen,  welches,  wie  mich  dünkt,  bisher  sehr \nwillkürlich  geschieht.  Auf  diesem  Punkte  bin  ich  in  meiner \nbotanischen  Philosophie  stecken  geblieben,  und  ich  sehe \nnoch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich  entwirren  will.  Die  Tiefe  und \nBreite  dieses  Geschäfts  scheint  mir  völlig  gleich. \nDer  große  Platz,  Prato  della  Valle  genannt,  ist  ein  selir \nweiter  Raum,  wo  der  Hauptmarkt  im  Juni  gehalten  wird. \nHölzerne  Buden  in  seiner  Mitte  geben  freilich  nicht  das \nvorteilhafteste  Ansehen,  die  Einwohner  aber  versichern, \ndaß  man  auch  bald  hier  eine  Fiera  von  Stein,  wie  die \nzu  Verona,  sehen  werde.  Hiezu  gibt  freilich  schon  jetzt  die \nUmgebung  des  Platzes  gegründete  Hoftnung,  welche  einen \nsehr  schönen  und  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährt. \nEin  ungeheures  Oval  ist  ringsum  mit  Statuen  besetzt,  alle \nberühmte  Männer  vorstellend,  welche  hier  gelehrt  und \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  65 \n\ngelernt  haben.  Einem  jeden  Einheimischen  und  Fremden \nist  erlaubt,  irgend  einem  Landsmann  oder  Verwandten \nhier  eine  Bildsäule  von  bestimmter  Größe  zu  errichten, \nsobald  das  Verdienst  der  Person  und  der  akademische \nAufenthalt  zu  Padua  bewiesen  ist. \n\nUm  das  Oval  umher  geht  ein  Wassergraben.  Auf  den \nvier  Brücken,  die  hinaufführen,  stehen  Päpste  und  Dogen \nkolossal;  die  übrigen,  kleiner,  sind  von  Zünften,  Partiku- \nliers  und  Fremden  gesetzt.  Der  König  von  Schweden \nließ  Gustav  Adolfen  hinstellen,  weil  man  sagt,  derselbe \nhabe  einmal  in  Padua  eine  Lektion  angehört.  Der  Erz- \nherzog Leopold  erneuerte  das  Andenken  Petrarchs  und \nGalileis.  Die  Statuen  sind  in  einer  braven  modernen \nManier  gemacht,  wenige  übermanieriert,  einige  recht \nnatürlich,  sämtlich  im  Kostüm  ihrer  Zeit  und  Würden. \nDie  Inschriften  sind  auch  zu  loben.  Es  findet  sich  nichts \nAbgeschmacktes  oder  Kleinliches  darunter. \nAuf  jeder  Universität  wäre  der  Gedanke  sehr  glücklich \ngewesen,  auf  dieser  ist  er  am  glücklichsten,  weil  es  sehr \nwohl  tut,  eine  völlige  Vergangenheit  wieder  hervorge- \nrufen zu  sehen.  Es  kann  ein  recht  schöner  Platz  werden, \nwenn  sie  die  hölzerne  Fiera  wegschafien  und  eine  von \nStein  erbauen,  wie  der  Plan  sein  soll. \n\nIn  dem  Versammlungsorte  einer  dem  heiligen  Antonius \ngewidmeten  Brüderschaft  sind  ältere  Bilder,  welche  an \ndie  alten  Deutschen  erinnern,  dabei  auch  einige  von \nTizian,  wo  schon  der  große  Fortschritt  merklich  ist,  den \nüber  den  Alpen  niemand  für  sich  getan  hat.  Gleich  dar- \nauf sah  ich  einiges  von  den  Neusten.  Diese  Künstler \nhaben,  da  sie  das  hohe  Ernste  nicht  mehr  erreichen \nkonnten,  das  Humoristische  sehr  glücklich  getroffen.  Die \nEnthauptung  Johannes'  von  Piazetta  ist,  wenn  man  des \nMeisters  Manier  zugibt,  in  diesem  Sinne  ein  recht  braves \nBild.  Johannes  kniet,  die  Hände  vor  sich  hinfaltend,  mit \ndem  rechten  Knie  an  einen  Stein.  Er  sieht  gen  Himmel. \nEin  Kriegsknecht,  der  ihn  hinten  gebunden  hält,  biegt \nsich  an  der  Seite  herum  und  sieht  ihm  ins  Gesicht,  als \nwenn  er  über  die  Gelassenheit  erstaunte,  womit  der  Mann \n\nGOETHE  IV  5 \n\n\n66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich  hingibt.  In  der  Höhe  steht  ein  anderer,  der  den \nStreich  vollführen  soll,  hat  aber  das  Schwert  nicht,  son- \ndern macht  nur  mit  den  Händen  die  Gebärde,  wie  einer, \nder  den  Streich  zum  voraus  versuchen  will.  Das  Schwert \nzieht  unten  ein  dritter  aus  der  Scheide.  Der  Gedanke \nist  glücklich,  wenn  auch  nicht  groß,  die  Komposition \nfrappant  und  von  der  besten  Wirkung. \nIn  der  Kirche  der  Eremitaner  habe  ich  Gemälde  von \nMantegna  gesehen,  einem  der  älteren  Maler,  vor  dem \nich  erstaunt  bin.  Was  in  diesen  Bildern  für  eine  scharfe, \nsichere  Gegenwart  dasteht!  Von  dieser  ganz  wahren, \nnicht  etwa  scheinbaren,  eftektlügenden,  bloß  zur  Ein- \nbildungskraft sprechenden,  sondern  derben,  reinen,  lich- \nten, ausführlichen,  gewissenhaften,  zarten,  umschriebenen \nGegenwart,  die  zugleich  etwas  Strenges,  Emsiges,  Müh- \nsames hatte,  gingen  die  folgenden  Maler  aus,  wie  ich  an \nBildern  von  Tizian  bemerkte,  und  nun  konnte  die  Leb- \nhaftigkeit ihres  Genies,  die  Energie  ihrer  Natur,  erleuchtet \nvon  dem  Geiste  ihrer  Vorfahren,  auferbaut  durch  ihre \nKraft,  immer  höher  und  höher  steigen,  sich  von  der  Erde \nheben  und  himmlische,  aber  wahre  Gestalten  hervor- \nbringen. So  entwickelte  sich  die  Kunst  nach  der  bar- \nbarischen Zeit. \n\nDer  Audienzsaal  des  Rathauses,  mit  Recht  durch  das \nAugmentativum  \"Salone\"  betitelt,  das  ungeheuerste  abge- \nschlossene Gefäß,  das  man  sich  nicht  vorstellen,  auch \nnicht  einmal  in  der  nächsten  Erinnerung  ziu\"ückrufen  kann. \nDreihundert  Euß  lang,  hundert  Euß  breit  und  bis  in  das \nder  Länge  nach  ihn  deckende  Gewölbe  hundert  Euß \nhoch.  So  gewohnt  sind  diese  Menschen,  im  Freien  zu \nleben,  daß  die  Baumeister  einen  Marktplatz  zu  über- \nwölben fanden. \n\nUnd  es  ist  keine  Frage,  daß  der  ungeheuere  überwölbte \nRaum  eine  eigene  Empfindung  gibt.  Es  ist  ein  abge- \nschloßnes  Unendliches,  dem  ISlenschen  analoger  als  der \nSternhimmel.  Dieser  reißt  uns  aus  uns  selbst  hinaus, \njener  drängt  uns,  auf  die  gelindeste  Weise,  in  uns  selbst \nzurück. \nSo  verweil  ich    auch   gern  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  67 \n\nJustine.  Diese  ist  vierhundertfünfundachtzig  Fuß  lang, \nverhältnismäßig  hoch  und  breit,  groß  und  einfach  gebaut. \nHeut'  abend  setzt'  ich  mich  in  einen  Winkel  und  hatte \nmeine  stille  Betrachtung.  Da  fühlt'  ich  mich  recht \nallein,  denn  kein  Mensch  in  der  Welt,  der  in  dem  Augen- \nblick an  mich  gedacht  hätte,  würde  mich  hier  gesucht \nhaben. \n\nNun  wäre  auch  hier  wieder  einmal  eingepackt;  morgen \nfrüh  geht  es  zu  Wasser  auf  der  Brenta  fort.  Heute  hat's \ngeregnet,  nun  ist's  wieder  ausgehellt,  und  ich  hoffe,  die \nLagunen  und  die  dem  Meer  vermählte  Herrscherin  bei \nschöner  Tageszeit  zu  erblicken  und  aus  ihrem  Schoß \nmeine  Freunde  zu  begrüßen. \n\nVENEDIG \n\nSO  stand  es  denn  im  Buche  des  Schicksals  auf  meinem \nBlatte  geschrieben,  daß  ich  1786  den  achtundzwanzig- \nsten September,  abends,  nach  unserer  Uhr  um  fünfe, \nVenedig  zum  erstenmal,  aus  der  Brenta  in  die  Lagunen \neinfahrend,  erblicken  und  bald  darauf  diese  wunderbare \nInselstadt,  diese  Biberrepublik,  betreten  und  besuchen \nsollte.  So  ist  denn  auch,  Gott  sei  Dank,  Venedig  mir  kein \nbloßes  Wort  mehr,  kein  hohler  Name,  der  mich  so  oft, \nmich,  den  Todfeind  von  Wortschällen,  geängstiget  hat. \nAls  die  erste  Gondel  an  das  Schiff  anfuhr — es  geschieht, \num  Passagiere,  welche  Eil'  haben,  geschwinder  nach \nVenedig  zu  bringen — erinnerte  ich  mich  eines  frühen \nKinderspielzeuges,  an  das  ich  vielleicht  seit  zwanzig \nJahren  nicht  mehr  gedacht  hatte.  Mein  Vater  besaß  ein \nschönes  mitgebrachtes  Gondelmodell;  er  hielt  es  sehr \nwert,  und  mir  ward  es  hoch  angerechnet,  wenn  ich  ein- \nmal damit  spielen  durfte.  Die  ersten  Schnäbel  von  blankem \nEisenblech,  die  schwarzen  Gondelkäfige,  alles  grüßte  mich \nwie  eine  alte  Bekanntschaft,  ich  genoß  einen  langent- \nbehrten freundlichen  Jugendeindruck. \nIch  bin  gut  logiert  in  der  Königin  von  England,  nicht \nweit  vom  Markusplatze,  und  dies  ist  der  größte  Vorzug \ndes  Quartiers;  meine  Fenster  gehen  auf  einen  schmalen \n\n\n68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nKanal  zwischen  hohen  Häusern,  gleich  unter  mir  eine \neinbogige  Brücke,  und  gegenüber  ein  schmales,  belebtes \nGäßchen.  So  wohne  ich,  und  so  werde  ich  eine  Zeitlang \nbleiben,  bis  mein  Paket  für  Deutschland  fertig  ist  und \nbis  ich  mich  am  Bilde  dieser  Stadt  satt  gesehen  habe. \nDie  Einsamkeit,  nach  der  ich  oft  so  sehnsuchtvoll  ge- \nseufzt, kann  ich  nun  recht  genießen;  denn  nirgends  fühlt \nman  sich  einsamer  als  im  Gewimmel,  wo  man  sich,  allen \nganz  unbekannt,  durchdrängt.  In  Venedig  kennt  mich \nvielleicht  nur  ein  Mensch,  und  der  wird  mir  nicht  gleich \nbegegnen. \n\nVenedig^  den  28.  September  j^86. \nWie  es  mir  von  Padua  hierher  gegangen,  nur  mit  wenig \nWorten:  Die  Fahrt  auf  der  Brenta,  mit  dem  öftentlichen \nSchiffe,  in  gesitteter  Gesellschaft,  da  die  Italiener  sich \nvoreinander  in  acht  nehmen,  ist  anständig  und  ange- \nnehm. Die  Ufer  sind  mit  Gärten  und  Lusthäusern  ge- \nschmückt; kleine  Ortschaften  treten  bis  ans  Wasser,  teil- \nweise geht  die  belebte  Landstraße  daran  hin.  Da  man \nschleusenweis  den  Fluß  hinabsteigt,  gibt  es  öfters  einen \nkleinen  Aufhalt,  den  man  benutzen  kann,  sich  auf  dem \nLande  umzusehen  und  die  reichlich  angebotenen  Früchte \nzu  genießen.  Nun  steigt  man  wieder  ein  und  bewegt \nsich  durch  eine  bewegte  Welt  voll  Fruchtbarkeit  und \nLeben. \n\nZu  so  viel  abwechselnden  Bildern  und  Gestalten  gesellte \nsich  noch  eine  Erscheinung,  die,  obgleich  aus  Deutsch- \nland abstammend,  doch  hier  ganz  eigentlich  an  ihrem \nPlatze  war,  zwei  Pilger  nämlich,  die  ersten,  die  ich  in \nder  Nähe  sah.  Sie  haben  das  Recht,  mit  dieser  öftent- \nlichen Gelegenheit  umsonst  weiter  gebracht  zu  werden; \nallein  weil  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  ihre  Nähe  scheut,  so \nsitzen  sie  nicht  mit  in  dem  bedeckten  Räume,  sondern \nhinten  bei  dem  Steuermann.  Als  eine  in  der  gegen- \nwärtigen Zeit  seltene  Erscheinung  wurden  sie  angestaunt \nund,  weil  früher  unter  dieser  Hülle  manch  Gesindel  um- \nhertrieb, wenig  geachtet.  Als  ich  vernahm,  daß  es  Deut- \nsche seien,  keiner  andern  Sprache  mächtig,  gesellte  ich \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  69 \n\nmich  zu  ihnen  und  vernahm,  daß  sie  aus  dem  Paderborni- \nschen herstammten.  Beides  waren  Männer  schon  über \nfünfzig,  von  dunkler,  aber  gutmütiger  Physiognomie.  Sie \nhatten  vor  allem  das  Grab  der  heiligen  drei  Könige  zu \nCöln  besucht,  waren  sodann  durch  Deutschland  gezogen \nund  nun  auf  dem  Wege,  zusammen  bis  Rom  und  sodann \nins  obere  Italien  zurückzugehen,  da  denn  der  eine  wieder \nnach  Westfalen  zu  wandern,  der  andere  aber  noch  den \nheiligen  Jakob  zu  Compostell  zu  verehren  gedachte. \nIhre  Kleidung  war  die  bekannte,  doch  sahen  sie  aufge- \nschürzt viel  besser  aus,  als  wir  sie  in  langen  Taffetkleidern \nauf  unsern  Redouten  vorzustellen  pflegen.  Der  große \nKragen,  der  runde  Hut,  der  Stab  und  die  Muschel,  als \ndas  unschuldigste  Trinkgeschirr,  alles  hatte  seine  Be- \ndeutung, seinen  unmittelbaren  Nutzen;  die  Blechkapsel \nenthielt  ihre  Pässe.  Das  Merkwürdigste  aber  waren  ihre \nkleinen  rotsaffianen  Brieftaschen;  in  diesen  befand  sich \nalles  kleine  Geräte,  was  nur  irgend  einem  einfachen  Be- \ndürfnis abzuhelfen  geeignet  sein  mochte.  Sie  hatten  die- \nselben hervorgezogen,  indem  sie  an  ihren  Kleidern  etwas \nzu  flicken  fanden. \n\nDer  Steuermann,  höchst  zufrieden,  daß  er  einen  Dol- \nmetscher fand,  ließ  mich  verschiedene  Fragen  an  sie  tun; \ndadurch  vernahm  ich  manches  von  ihren  Ansichten,  be- \nsonders aber  von  ihrer  Reise.  Sie  beklagten  sich  bitter- \nlich über  ihre  Glaubensgenossen,  ja  Weltpriester  und \nKlostergeistliche.  Die  Frömmigkeit,  sagten  sie,  müsse \neine  sehr  seltene  Sache  sein,  weil  man  an  die  ihrige  nir- \ngends glauben  wolle,  sondern  sie  fast  durchaus,  ob  sie \ngleich  die  ihnen  vorgeschriebene  geistliche  Marschroute \nimd  die  bischöflichen  Pässe  vorgezeigt,  in  katholischen \nLanden  wie  Landstreicher  behandle.  Sie  erzählten  da- \ngegen mit  Rührung,  wie  gut  sie  von  den  Protestanten \naufgenommen  worden,  besonders  von  einem  Landgeist- \nlichen in  Schwaben,  vorzüglich  aber  von  seiner  Frau, \nwelche  den  einigermaßen  widerstrebenden  Mann  dahin \nvermocht,  daß  sie  ihnen  reichliche  Erquickung  zuteilen \ndürfen,  welche  ihnen  sehr  not  getan.  Ja  beim  Abschiede \nhabe  sie  ihnen  einen  Konventionstaler  geschenkt,   der \n\n\n70  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nihnen  sehr  zustatten  gekommen,  sobald  sie  das  katho- \nlische Gebiet  wieder  betreten.  Hierauf  sagte  der  eine \nmit  aller  Erhebung,  deren  er  fähig  war:  Wir  schließen \ndiese  Frau  aber  auch  täglich  in  unser  Gebet  ein  und  bit- \nten Gott,  daß  er  ihre  Augen  öflhe,  wie  er  ihr  Herz  für \nuns  geöffnet  hat,  daß  er  sie,  wenn  auch  spät,  aufnehme \nin  den  Schoß  der  alleinseligmachenden  Kirche;  und  so \nhoffen  wir  gewiß,  ihr  dereinst  im  Paradies  zu  begegnen. \nVon  diesem  allen  erklärte  ich,  was  nötig  und  nützlich \nwar,  auf  der  kleinen  Steige  sitzend,  die  auf  das  Verdeck \nführt,  dem  Steuermanne  und  einigen  andern  Personen, \ndie  sich  aus  der  Kajüte  in  den  engen  Raum  gedrängt \nhatten.  Den  Pilgern  wurden  einige  ärmliche  Erquickun- \ngen gereicht,  denn  der  Italiener  liebt  nicht  zu  geben.  Sie \nzogen  hierauf  kleine  geweihte  Zettel  hervor,  worauf  zu \nsehen  das  Bild  der  heiligen  drei  Könige,  nebst  lateini- \nschen Gebeten  zur  Verehrung.  Die  guten  Menschen  baten \nmich,  die  kleine  Gesellschaft  damit  zu  beschenken  und \nihr  den  hohen  Wert  dieser  Blätter  begreiflich  zu  machen. \nDieses  gelang  mir  auch  ganz  gut,  denn  als  die  beiden \nMänner  sehr  verlegen  schienen,  wie  sie  in  dem  großen \nVenedig  das  zur  Aufnahme  der  Pilger  bestimmte  Kloster \nausfinden  sollten,  so  versprach  der  gerührte  Steuermann, \nwenn  sie  landeten,  wollte  er  einem  Burschen  sogleich \neinen  Dreier  geben,  damit  er  sie  zu  jenem  entfernt  ge- \nlegenen Orte  geleitete.  Sie  würden  zwar,  setzte  er  ver- \ntraulich hinzu,  sie  würden  dort  wenig  Trost  finden:  die \nAnstalt,  sehr  groß  angelegt,  um  ich  weiß  nicht  wie  viel \nPilger  zu  fassen,  sei  gegenwärtig  ziemlich  zusammen- \ngegangen, und  die  Einkünfte  würden  eben  anders  ver- \nwendet. \n\nSo  unterhalten,  waren  wir  die  schöne  Brenta  herunter- \ngekommen, manchen  herrlichen  Garten,  manchen  herr- \nlichen Palast  hinter  uns  lassend,  wohlhabende,  belebte \nOrtschaften  an  der  Küste  mit  flüchtigem  Blick  beschauend. \nAls  wir  nun  in  die  Lagunen  einfuhren,  umschwärmten \nmehrere  Gondeln  sogleich  das  SchiÖ\".  Ein  Lombard,  in \nVenedig  wohl  bekannt,  forderte  mich  auf,  ihm  Gesell- \nschaft zu  leisten,  damit  wir  geschwinder  drinne  wären \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  71 \n\nund  der  Doganenqual  entgingen.  Einige,  die  uns  ab- \nhalten wollten,  wußte  er  mit  einem  mäßigen  Trinkgeld \nzu  beseitigen,  und  so  schwammen  wir,  bei  einem  heitern \nSonnenuntergang,  schnell  unserm  Ziel  entgegen. \n\nDen  2g.  Septet?iber,  Michaelistag  abends. \nVon  Venedig  ist  schon  viel  erzählt  und  gedruckt,  daß  ich \nmit  Beschreibung  nicht  umständlich  sein  will;  ich  sage \nnur,  wie  es  mir  entgegenkömmt.  Was  sich  mir  aber  vor \nallem  andern  aufdringt,  ist  abermals  das  Volk,  eine  große \nMasse,  ein  notwendiges  unwillkürliches  Dasein. \nDieses  Geschlecht  hat  sich  nicht  zum  Spaß  auf  diese  In- \nseln geflüchtet;  es  war  keine  Willkür,  welche  die  Fol- \ngenden trieb,  sich  mit  ihnen  zu  vereinigen:  die  Not  lehrte \nsie  ihre  Sicherheit  in  der  unvorteilhaftesten  Lage  suchen, \ndie  ihnen  nachher  so  vorteilhaft  ward  und  sie  klug  machte, \nals  noch  die  ganze  nördliche  Welt  im  Düstern  gefangen \nlag;  ihre  Vermehrung,  ihr  Reichtum  war  notwendige \nFolge.  Nun  drängten  sich  die  Wohnungen  enger  und \nenger,  Sand  und  Sumpf  wurden  durch  Felsen  ersetzt; \ndie  Häuser  suchten  die  Luft,  wie  Bäume,  die  geschlossen \nstehen:  sie  mußten  an  Höhe  zu  gewinnen  suchen,  was \nihnen  an  Breite  abging.  Auf  jede  Spanne  des  Bodens \ngeizig  und  gleich  anfangs  in  enge  Räume  gedrängt,  ließen \nsie  zu  Gassen  nicht  mehr  Breite,  als  nötig  war,  eine \nHausreihe  von  der  gegenüberstehenden  zu  trennen  und \ndem  Bürger  notdürftige  Durchgänge  zu  erhalten.  Übri- \ngens war  ihnen  das  Wasser  statt  Straße,  Platz  und  Spa- \nziergang. Der  Venezianer  mußte  eine  neue  Art  von  Ge- \nschöpf werden,  wie  man  denn  auch  Venedig  nur  mit  sich \nselbst  vergleichen  kann.  Der  große  schlangenförmig  ge- \nwundene Kanal  weicht  keiner  Straße  in  der  Welt,  dem \nRaum  vor  dem  Markusplatze  kann  wohl  nichts  an  die \nSeite  gesetzt  werden:  ich  meine  den  großen  Wasserspiegel, \nder  diesseits  von  dem  eigentlichen  Venedig  im  halben \nMond  umfaßt  wird.  Über  der  Wasserfläche  sieht  man \nlinks  die  Insel  San  Giorgio  Maggiore,  etwas  weiter  rechts \ndie  Giudecca  und  ihren  Kanal,  noch  weiter  rechts  die \nDogane  und  die  Einfahrt  in  den  Canal  Grande,  wo  uns \n\n\n72  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngleich  ein  paar  ungeheure  Marmortempel  entgegenleuch- \nten. Dies  sind  mit  wenigen  Zügen  die  Hauptgegenstände, \ndie  uns  in  die  Augen  fallen,  wenn  wir  zwischen  den  zwei \nSäulen  des  Markusplatzes  hervortreten.  Die  sämtlichen \nAus-  und  Ansichten  sind  so  oft  in  Kupfer  gestochen,  daß \ndie  Freunde  davon  sich  gar  leicht  einen  anschaulichen \nBegriff  machen  können. \n\nNach  Tische  eilte  ich,  mir  erst  einen  Eindruck  des  Gan- \nzen zu  versichern,  und  warf  mich,  ohne  Begleiter,  nur \ndie  Himmelsgegenden  merkend,  ins  Labyrinth  der  Stadt, \nwelche,  obgleich  durchaus  von  Kanälen  und  Kanälchen \ndurchschnitten,  durch  Brücken  und  Brückchen  wieder  zu- \nsammenhängt. Die  Enge  und  Gedrängtheit  des  Ganzen \ndenkt  man  nicht,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben.  Gewöhnlich \nkann  man  die  Breite  der  Gasse  mit  ausgereckten  Armen \nentweder  ganz  oder  beinahe  messen,  in  den  engsten  stößt \nman  schon  mit  den  Ellbogen  an,  wenn  man  die  Hände \nin  die  Seite  stemmt;  es  gibt  wohl  breitere,  auch  hie  und \nda  ein  Plätzchen,  verhältnismäßig  aber  kann  alles  enge \ngenannt  werden. \n\nIch  fand  leicht  den  großen  Kanal  und  die  Hauptbrücke \nRialto;  sie  besteht  aus  einem  einzigen  Bogen  von  weißem \nMarmor.  Von  oben  herunter  ist  es  eine  große  Ansicht: \nder  Kanal  gesäet  voll  Schiffe,  die  alles  Bedürfnis  vom \nfesten  Lande  herbeiführen  und  hier  hauptsächlich  anlegen \nund  ausladen;  dazwischen  wimmelt  es  von  Gondeln.  Be- \nsonders heute,  als  am  Michaelisfeste,  gab  es  einen  An- \nblick wunderschön  lebendig;  doch  um  diesen  einiger- \nmaßen darzustellen,  muß  ich  etwas  weiter  ausholen. \nDie  beiden  Hauptteile  von  Venedig,  welche  der  große \nKanal  trennt,  werden  durch  die  einzige  Brücke  Rialto \nmiteinander  verbunden,  doch  ist  auch  für  mehrere  Kom- \nmunikation gesorgt,  welche,  in  offenen  Barken,  an  be- \nstimmten Überfahrtspunkten  geschieht.  Nun  sah  es  heute \nsehr  gut  aus,  als  die  wohlgekleideten,  doch  mit  einem \nschwarzen  Schleier  bedeckten  Frauen  sich,  viele  zusam- \nmen, übersetzen  ließen,  um  zu  der  Kirche  des  gefeierten \nErzengels  zu  gelangen.  Ich  verließ  die  Brücke  und  be- \ngab  mich  an  einen  solchen  Überfahrtspunkt,  die  Aus- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  73 \n\nsteigenden  genau  zu  betrachten.  Ich  habe  sehr  schöne \nGesichter  und  Gestalten  darunter  gefunden. \nNachdem  ich  müde  geworden,  setzte  ich  mich  in  eine \nGondel,  die  engen  Gassen  verlassend,  und  fuhr,  mir  das  ent- \ngegengesetzte Schauspiel  zu  bereiten,  den  nördlichen  Teil \ndes  großen  Kanals  durch,  um  die  Insel  der  heiligen  Klara, \nin  die  Lagunen,  den  Kanal  der  Giudecca  herein,  bis  ge- \ngen den  Markusplatz,  und  war  nun  auf  einmal  ein  Mit- \nherr des  Adriatischen  Meeres,  wie  jeder  Venezianer  sich \nfühlt,  wenn  er  sich  in  seine  Gondel  legt.  Ich  gedachte  dabei \nmeines  guten  Vaters  in  Ehren,  der  nichts  Besseres  wußte, \nals  von  diesen  Dingen  zu  erzählen.  Wird  mir's  nicht  auch \nso  gehen?  Alles,  was  mich  umgibt,  ist  würdig,  ein  großes \nrespektables  Werk  versammelter  Menschenkraft,  ein  herr- \nliches Monument,  nicht  eines  Gebieters,  sondern  eines \nVolks.  Und  wenn  auch  ihre  Lagunen  sich  nach  und  nach \nausfüllen,  böse  Dünste  über  dem  Sumpfe  schweben,  ihr \nHandel  geschwächt,  ihre  Macht  gesunken  ist,  so  wird \ndie  ganze  Anlage  der  Republik  und  ihr  Wesen  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  dem  Beobachter  weniger  ehrwürdig \nsein.  Sie  unterliegt  der  Zeit,  wie  alles,  was  ein  erschei- \nnendes Dasein  hat. \n\nDen  30.  September. \nGegen  Abend  verlief  ich  mich  wieder,  ohne  Führer,  in \ndie  entferntesten  Quartiere  der  Stadt.  Die  hiesigen  Brük- \nken  sind  alle  mit  Treppen  angelegt,  damit  Gondeln  und \nauch  wohl  größere  Schiffe  bequem  unter  den  Bogen  hin- \nfahren. Ich  suchte  mich  in  und  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \nzu  finden,  ohne  irgend  jemand  zu  fragen,  mich  abermals \nnur  nach  der  Himmelsgegend  richtend.  Man  entwirrt \nsich  wohl  endlich,  aber  es  ist  ein  unglaubliches  Gehecke \nineinander,  und  meine  Manier,  sich  recht  sinnlich  da- \nvon zu  überzeugen,  die  beste.  Auch  habe  ich  mir,  bis \nan  die  letzte  bewohnte  Spitze,  der  Einwohner  Betragen, \nLebensart,  Sitte  und  Wesen  gemerkt;  in  jedem  Quartiere \nsind  sie  anders  beschaffen.  Du  lieber  Gott!  was  doch \nder  Mensch  für  ein  armes,  gutes  Tier  ist! \nSehr  viele  Häuserchen  stehen  unmittelbar  in  den  Ka- \n\n\n74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nnälen;  doch  gibt  es  hie  und  da  schön  gepflasterte  Stein- \ndämnie,  auf  denen  man  zwischen  Wasser,  Kirchen  und \nPalästen  gar  angenehm  hin  und  wieder  spaziert.  Lustig \nund  erfreuhch  ist  der  lange  Steindamm  an  der  nördlichen \nSeite,  von  welchem  die  Inseln,  besonders  Murano,  das \nVenedig  im  kleinen,  geschaut  werden.  Die  Lagunen  da- \nzwischen sind  von  vielen  Gondeln  belebt. \n\nAbends. \nHeute  habe  ich  abermals  meinen  Begriff  von  Venedig \nerweitert,  indem  ich  mir  den  Plan  verschaffte.  Als  ich \nihn  einigermaßen  studiert,  bestieg  ich  den  Markusturm, \nwo  sich  dem  Auge  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  darstellt.  Es \nwar  um  Mittag  und  heller  Sonnenschein,  daß  ich  ohne \nPerspektiv  Nähen  und  Fernen  genau  erkennen  konnte. \nDie  Flut  bedeckte  die  Lagunen,  und  als  ich  den  Blick \nnach  dem  sogenannten  Lido  wandte — es  ist  ein  schmaler \nErdstreif,  der  die  Lagunen  schließt — sah  ich  zum  ersten- \nmal das  Meer  und  einige  Segel,  darauf.  In  den  Lagunen \nselbst  liegen  Galeeren  und  Fregatten,  die  zum  Ritter  Emo \nstoßen  sollten,  der  den  Algierern  den  Krieg  macht,  die \naber  wegen  ungünstiger  Winde  liegen  bleiben.  Die  Padu- \nanischen  und  Vicentinischen  Berge  und  das  Tiroler  Ge- \nbirge schließen,  zwischen  Abend  und  Mitternacht,  das \nBild  ganz  trefflich  schön. \n\nDen  I.  Oktober. \nIch  ging  und  besah  mir  die  Stadt  in  mancherlei  Rück- \nsichten, und  da  es  eben  Sonntag  war,  fiel  mir  die  große \nUnreinlichkeit  der  Straßen  auf,  worüber  ich  meine  Be- \ntrachtungen anstellen  mußte.  Es  ist  wohl  eine  Art  von \nPolizei  in  diesem  Artikel:  die  Leute  schieben  den  Keh- \nricht in  die  Ecken;  auch  sehe  ich  große  Schiffe  hin  und \nwieder  fahren,  die  an  manchen  Orten  stille  liegen  und \ndas  Kehricht  mitnehmen,  Leute  von  den  Inseln  umher, \nwelche  des  Düngers  bedürfen;  aber  es  ist  in  diesen  An- \nstalten weder  Folge  noch  Strenge  imd  desto  unverzeih- \nlicher die  Unreinlichkeit  der  Stadt,  da  sie  ganz  zur  Rein- \nlichkeit angelegt  worden,  so  gut  als  irgend  eine  hol- \nländische. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  75 \n\nAlle  Straßen  sind  geplattet,  selbst  die  entferntesten \nQuartiere  wenigstens  mit  Backsteinen  auf  der  hohen \nKante  ausgesetzt,  wo  es  nötig,  in  der  Mitte  ein  wenig \nerhaben,  an  der  Seite  Vertiefungen,  das  Wasser  aufzu- \nfassen und  in  bedeckte  Kanäle  zu  leiten.  Noch  andere \narchitektonische  Vorrichtungen  der  ersten  wohlüberdach- \nten Anlage  zeugen  von  der  Absicht  trefflicher  Baumeister, \nVenedig  zu  der  reinsten  Stadt  zu  machen,  wie  sie  die \nsonderbarste  ist.  Ich  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  gleich \nim  Spaziergehen  eine  Anordnung  deshalb  zu  entwerfen \nund  einem  Polizeivorsteher,  dem  es  Ernst  wäre,  in  Ge- \ndanken vorzuarbeiten.  So  hat  man  immer  Trieb  und  Lust, \nvor  fremden  Türen  zu  kehren. \n\nDen  2.  Oktober. \nVor  allem  eilte  ich  in  die  Caritä:  ich  hatte  in  des  Pal- \nladio  Werken  gefunden,  daß  er  hier  ein  Klostergebäude \nangegeben,  in  welchem  er  die  Privatwohnung  der  reichen \nund  gastfreien  Alten  darzustellen  gedachte.  Der  sowohl \nim  ganzen  als  in  seinen  einzelnen  Teilen  trefflich  ge- \nzeichnete Plan  machte  mir  unendliche  Freude,  und  ich \nhofi'te  ein  Wunderwerk  zu  finden;  aber  ach!  es  ist  kaum \nder  zehnte  Teil  ausgeführt;  doch  auch  dieser  Teil  seines \nhimmlischen  Genius  würdig,  eine  Vollkommenheit  in  der \nAnlage  und  eine  Genauigkeit  in  der  Ausführung,  die  ich \nnoch  nicht  kannte.  Jahrelang  sollte  man  in  Betrachtung \nso  eines  Werks  zubringen.  Mich  dünkt,  ich  habe  nichts \nHöheres,  nichts  Vollkommneres  gesehen,  und  glaube,  daß \nich  mich  nicht  irre.  Denke  man  sich  aber  auch  den \ntrefflichen  Künstler,  mit  dem  Innern  Sinn  fürs  Große \nund  Gefällige  geboren,  der  erst  mit  unglaublicher  Mühe \nsich  an  den  Alten  heranbildet,  um  sie  alsdann  durch  sich \nwiederherzustellen.  Dieser  findet  Gelegenheit,  einen  Lieb- \nlingsgedanken auszuführen,  ein  Kloster,  so  vielen  Mön- \nchen zur  Wohnung,  so  vielen  Fremden  zur  Herberge \nbestimmt,  nach  der  Form  eines  antiken  Privatgebäudes \naufzurichten. \n\nDie  Kirche  stand  schon;  aus  ihr  tritt  man  in  ein  Atrium \nvon  korinthischen  Säulen,  man  ist  entzückt  und  vergißt \n\n\n76  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  einmal  alles  Pfaffentum.  An  der  einen  Seite  findet \nman  die  Sakristei,  an  der  andern  ein  Kapitelzimmer, \ndaneben  die  schönste  Wendeltreppe  von  der  Welt,  mit \noffener  weiter  Spindel,  die  steinernen  Stufen  in  die  Wand \ngemauert  und  so  geschichtet,  daß  eine  die  andere  trägt; \nman  wird  nicht  müde,  sie  auf  und  ab  zu  steigen;  wie \nschön  sie  geraten  sei,  kann  man  daraus  abnehmen,  daß \nsie  Palladio  selbst  für  wohlgeraten  angibt.  Aus  dem  Vor- \nhof tritt  man  in  den  innern  großen  Hof.  Von  dem  Ge- \nbäude, das  ihn  umgeben  sollte,  ist  leider  nur  die  linke \nSeite  aufgeführt,  drei  Säulenordnungen  übereinander,  auf \nder  Erde  Hallen,  im  ersten  Stock  ein  Bogengang  vor  den \nZellen  hin,  der  obere  Stock  Mauer  mit  Fenstern.  Doch \ndiese  Beschreibung  muß  durch  den  Anblick  der  Risse  ge- \nstärkt werden.  Nun  ein  Wort  von  der  Ausführung. \nNur  die  Häupter  und  Füße  der  Säulen  und  die  Schluß- \nsteine der  Bogen  sind  von  gehauenem  Stein,  das  übrige \nalles,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  von  Backsteinen,  sondern  von \ngebranntem  Ton.  Solche  Ziegeln  kenne  ich  gar  nicht. \nFries  und  Karnies  sind  auch  daraus,  die  Glieder  der  Bo- \ngen gleichfalls,  alles  teilweise  gebrannt  und  das  Gebäude \nzuletzt  nur  mit  wenig  Kalk  zusammengesetzt.  Es  steht \nwie  aus  einem  Guß.  'Wäre  das  Ganze  fertig  geworden \nund  man  sähe  es  reinlich  abgerieben  und  gefärbt,  es \nmüßte  ein  himmlischer  Anblick  sein. \nJedoch  die  Anlage  war  zu  groß,  wie  bei  so  manchem  Gebäude \nder  neuern  Zeit.  Der  Künstler  hatte  nicht  nur  vorausge- \nsetzt, daß  man  das  jetzige  Kloster  abreißen,  sondern  auch \nanstoßende  Nachbarshäuser  kaufen  werde;  und  da  mögen \nGeld  und  Lust  ausgegangen  sein.  Du  liebes  Schicksal,  das \ndu  so  manche  Dummheit  begünstigt  und  verewigt  hast, \nwarum  ließest  du  dieses  Werk  nicht  zustande  kommen! \n\nDen  s-  Oktober. \nDie  Kirche  II  Redentore,  ein  schönes  großes  Werk  von \nPalladio,  die  Fassade  lobenswürdiger  als  die  von  San \nGiorgio.  Diese  mehrmals  in  Kupfer  gestochenen  Werke \nmüßte  man  vor  sich  sehen,  um  das  Gesagte  verdeutlichen \nzu  können.    Hier  nur  wenige  Worte. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  77 \n\nPalladio  war  durchaus  von  der  Existenz  der  Alten  durch- \ndrungen und  fühlte  die  Kleinheit  und  Enge  seiner  Zeit \nwie  ein  großer  Mensch,  der  sich  nicht  hingeben,  sondern \ndas  übrige  so  viel  als  möglich  nach  seinen  edlen  Be- \ngrifien  umbilden  will.  Er  war  unzufrieden,  wie  ich  aus \ngelinder  Wendung  seines  Buches  schließe,  daß  man  bei \nchristlichen  Kirchen  nach  der  Form  der  alten  Basiliken \nzu  bauen  fortfahre:  er  suchte  deshalb  seine  heiligen  Ge- \nbäude der  alten  Tempelform  zu  nähern;  daher  ent- \nstanden gewisse  Unschicklichkeiten,  die  mir  bei  II  Reden- \ntore glücklich  beseitigt,  bei  San  Giorgio  aber  zu  auffallend \nerscheinen.  Volkmann  sagt  etwas  davon,  trifft  aber  den \nNagel  nicht  auf  den  Kopf. \n\nInwendig  ist  II  Redentore  gleichfalls  köstlich,  alles,  auch \ndie  Zeichnung  der  Altäre,  von  Palladio;  leider  die  Ni- \nschen, die  mit  Statuen  ausgefüllt  werden  sollten,  prangen \nmit  flachen,  ausgeschnittenen,  gemalten  Brettfiguren. \n\nDem  heiligen  Franziskus  zu  Ehren  hatten  die  Patres \nKapuziner  einen  Seitenaltar  mächtig  ausgeputzt:  man \nsah  nichts  von  Stein  als  die  korinthischen  Kapitale; \nalles  übrige  schien  mit  einer  geschmackvollen  prächtigen \nStickerei,  nach  Art  der  Arabesken,  überzogen,  und  zwar \nso  artig,  als  man  nur  etwas  zu  sehen  wünschte.  Beson- \nders wunderte  ich  mich  über  die  breiten,  goldgestickten \nRanken  und  Laubwerke.  Ich  ging  näher  und  fand  einen \nrecht  hübschen  Betrug.  Alles,  was  ich  für  Gold  gehalten \nhatte^  war  breitgedrücktes  Stroh,  nach  schönen  Zeich- \nnungen auf  Papier  geklebt,  der  Grund  mit  lebhaften  Far- \nben angestrichen,  und  das  so  mannigfaltig  und  ge- \nschmackvoll, daß  dieser  Spaß,  dessen  Material  gar  nichts \nwert  war  und  der  wahrscheinlich  im  Kloster  selbst  aus- \ngeführt wurde,  mehrere  tausend  Taler  müßte  gekostet \nhaben,  wenn  er  echt  hätte  sein  sollen.  Man  könnte  es \ngelegentlich  wohl  nachahmen. \n\nAuf  einem  Uferdamme,  im  Angesicht  des  Wassers,  be- \nmerkte ich  schon  einigemal  einen  geringen  Kerl,  welcher \neiner  größern  oder  kleinern  Anzahl  von  Zuhörern  im \nvenezianischen  Dialekt   Geschichten  erzählte;  ich  kann \n\n\n78  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nleider  nichts  davon  verstehen;  es  lacht  aber  kein  Mensch, \nnur  selten  lächelt  das  Auditorium,  das  meist  aus  der  ganz \nniedern  Klasse  besteht.  Auch  hat  der  Mann  nichts  Auf- \nfallendes noch  Lächerliches  in  seiner  Art,  vielmehr  et- \nwas sehr  Gesetztes,  zugleich  eine  bewundrungswürdige \nMannigfaltigkeit  und  Präzision,  welche  auf  Kunst  und \nNachdenken  hinwiesen,  in  seinen  Gebärden. \n\nDen  Plan  in  der  Hand,  suchte  ich  mich  durch  die  wunder- \nlichsten Irrgänge  bis  zur  Kirche  der  Mendicanti  zu  finden. \nHier  ist  das  Konservatorium,  welches  gegenwärtig  den \nmeisten  Beifall  hat.  Die  Frauenzimmer  fühj-ten  ein  Ora- \ntorium hinter  dem  Gitter  auf,  die  Kirche  war  voll  Zu- \nhörer, die  Musik  sehr  schön,  und  herrliche  Stimmen.  Ein \nAlt  sang  den  König  Saul,  die  Hauptperson  des  Gedichtes. \nVon  einer  solchen  Stimme  hatte  ich  gar  keinen  Begriff; \neinige  Stellen  der  Musik  waren  unendlich  schön,  der  Text \nvollkommen  singbar,  so  italienisch  Latein,  daß  man  an \nmanchen  Stellen  lachen  muß;  die  Musik  aber  findet  hier \nein  weites  Feld. \n\nEs  wäre  ein  trefflicher  Genuß  gewesen,  wenn  nicht  der \nvermaledeite  Kapellmeister  den  Takt  mit  einer  Rolle \nNoten  wider  das  Gitter  und  so  unverschämt  geklappt \nhätte,  als  habe  er  mit  Schuljungen  zu  tun,  die  er  eben \nunterrichtete;  und  die  Mädchen  hatten  das  Stück  oft \nwiederholt,  sein  Klatschen  war  ganz  unnötig  und  zerstörte \nallen  Eindruck,  nicht  anders  als  wenn  einer,  um  uns  eine \nschöne  Statue  begreiflich  zu  machen,  ihr  Scharlachläpp- \nchen auf  die  Gelenke  klebte.  Der  fremde  Schall  hebt  alle \nHarmonie  auf.  Das  ist  nun  ein  Musiker,  und  er  hört  es  nicht, \noder  er  will  vielmehr,  daß  man  seine  Gegenwart  durch \neine  Unschicklichkeit  vernehmen  soll,  da  es  besser  wäre, \ner  ließe  seinen  Wert  an  der  Vollkommenheit  der  Ausführung \nerraten.  Ich  weiß,  die  Franzosen  haben  es  an  der  Art; \nden  Italienern  hätte  ich  es  nicht  zugetraut,  und  das  Publi- \nkum scheint  daran  gewöhnt.  Es  ist  nicht  das  einzige  Mal, \ndaß  es  sich  einbilden  läßt,  das  gerade  gehöre  zum  Genuß, \nwas  den  Genuß  verdirbt. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  79 \n\nGestern  abend  Oper  zu  St.  Moses  (denn  die  Theater  haben \nihren  Namen  von  der  Kirche,  der  sie  am  nächsten  liegen); \nnicht  recht  erfreuUch!  Es  fehlt  dem  Poem,  der  Musik, \nden  Sängern  eine  innere  Energie,  welche  allein  eine  solche \nDarstellung  auf  den  höchsten  Punkt  treiben  kann.  Man \nkonnte  von  keinem  Teile  sagen,  er  sei  schlecht;  aber  nur \ndie  zwei  Frauen  ließen  sich's  angelegen  sein,  nicht  so- \nwohl gut  zu  agieren  als  sich  zu  produzieren  und  zu  ge- \nfallen. Das  ist  denn  immer  etwas.  Es  sind  zwei  schöne \nFiguren,  gute  Stimmen,  artige,  muntere,  gätliche  Per- \nsönchen.  Unter  den  Männern  dagegen  keine  Spur  von \ninnerer  Gewalt  und  Lust,  dem  Publikum  etwas  aufzuheften, \nsowie  keine  entschieden  glänzende  Stimme. \nDas  Ballett,  von  elender  Erfindung,  ward  im  ganzen  aus- \ngepfififen,  einige  treöliche  Springer  und  Springerinnen \njedoch,  welche  letztere  sich  es  zur  Pflicht  rechneten,  die \nZuschauer  mit  jedem  schönen  Teil  ihres  Körpers  bekannt \nzu  machen,  wurden  weidlich  beklatscht. \n\nHeute  dagegen  sah  ich  eine  andere  Komödie,  die  mich \nmehr  gefreut  hat.  Im  herzoglichen  Palast  hörte  ich  eine \nRechtssache  öfientlich  verhandeln;  sie  war  wichtig  und \nzu  meinem  Glück  in  den  Ferien  vorgenommen.  Der  eine \nAdvokat  war  aUes,  was  ein  übertriebener  BufFo  nur  sein \nsollte.  Figur  dick,  kurz,  doch  beweglich,  ein  ungeheuer \nvorspringendes  Profil,  eine  Stimme  wie  Erz  und  eine \nHeftigkeit,  als  wenn  es  ihm  aus  tiefstem  Grunde  des \nHerzens  Ernst  wäre,  was  er  sagte.  Ich  nenne  dies  eine \nKomödie,  weil  alles  wahrscheinlich  schon  fertig  ist,  wenn \ndiese  öffentliche  Darstellung  geschieht:  die  Richter  wissen, \nwas  sie  sprechen  sollen,  und  die  Partei  weiß,  was  sie  zu \nerwarten  hat.  Indessen  gefällt  mir  diese  Art  unendlich \nbesser  als  unsere  Stuben-  und  Kanzleihockereien.  Und \nnun  von  den  Umständen,  und  wie  artig,  ohne  Prunk,  wie \nnatürlich  alles  zugeht,  will  ich  suchen  einen  Begriff  zu \ngeben. \n\nIn  einem  geräumigen  Saal  des  Palastes  saßen  an  der  einen \nSeite  die  Richter  im  Halbzirkel.  Gegen  ihnen  über,  auf \neinem  Katheder,  der  mehrere  Personen  nebeneinander \n\n\n8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfassen  konnte,  die  Advokaten  beider  Parteien;  unmittel- \nbar vor  demselben,  auf  ei7:er  Bank,  Kläger  und  Beklagte \nin  eigner  Person.  Der  Advokat  des  Klägers  war  von  dem \nKatheder  herabgestiegen,  denn  die  heutige  Sitzung  war \nzu  keiner  Kontrovers  bestimmt.  Die  sämtlichen  Doku- \nmente für  und  wider,  obgleich  schon  gedruckt,  sollten \nvorgelesen  werden. \n\nEin  hagerer  Schreiber,  in  schwarzem  kümmerlichen  Rocke, \nein  dickes  Heft  in  der  Hand,  bereitete  sich,  die  Pflicht \ndes  Lesenden  zu  erfüllen.  Von  Zuschauern  und  Zuhörern \nwar  übrigens  der  Saal  gedrängt  voll.  Die  Rechtsfrage \nselbst  sowie  die  Personen,  welche  sie  betraf,  mußten  den \nVenezianern  höchst  bedeutend  scheinen. \nFideikommisse  haben  in  diesem  Staat  die  entschiedenste \nGunst:  ein  Besitztum,  welchem  einmal  dieser  Charakter \naufgeprägt  ist,  behält  ihn  für  ewige  Zeiten;  es  mag  durch \nirgend  eine  Wendung  oder  Umstand  vor  mehrern  hundert \nJahren  veräußert  worden,  durch  viele  Hände  gegangen \nsein,  zuletzt,  wenn  die  Sache  zur  Sprache  kommt,  be- \nhalten die  Nachkommen  der  ersten  Familie  recht,  und \ndie  Güter  müssen  herausgegeben  werden. \nDiesmal  war  der  Streit  höchst  wichtig,  denn  die  Klage \nging  gegen  den  Doge  selbst  oder  vielmehr  gegen  seine \nGemahlin,  welche  denn  auch  in  Person  auf  dem  Bänkchen, \nvom  Kläger  nur  durch  einen  kleinen  Zwischenraum  ge- \ntrennt, in  ihren  Zendal  gehüllt  dasaß.  Eine  Dame  von \ngewissem  Alter,  edlem  Körperbau,  wohlgebildetem  Ge- \nsicht, auf  welchem  ernste,  ja  wenn  man  will  etwas  ver- \ndrießliche Züge  zu  sehen  waren.  Die  Venezianer  bildeten \nsich  viel  darauf  ein,  daß  die  Fürstin,  in  ilirera  eignen \nPalast,  vor  dem  Gericht  und  ihnen  erscheinen  müsse. \nDer  Schreiber  fing  zu  lesen  an,  und  nun  ward  mir  erst \ndeutlich,  was  ein  im  Angesicht  der  Richter,  unfern  des \nKatheders  der  Advokaten,  hinter  einem  kleinen  Tische \nauf  einem  niedern  Schemel  sitzendes  Männchen,  besonders \naber  die  Sanduhr  bedeute,  die  er  vor  sich  niedergelegt \nhatte.  Solange  nämlich  der  Schreiber  liest,  so  lange \nläuft  die  Zeit  nicht;  dem  Advokaten  aber,  wenn  er  dabei \nsprechen  will,  ist  nur  im  ganzen  eine  gewisse  Frist  ge- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  81 \n\ngönnt.  Der  Schreiber  liest,  die  Uhr  liegt,  das  Männchen \nhat  die  Hand  daran.  Tut  der  Advokat  den  Mund  auf,  so \nsteht  auch  die  Uhr  schon  in  der  Höhe,  die  sich  sogleich \nniedersenkt,  sobald  er  schweigt.  Hier  ist  nun  die  große \nKunst,  in  den  Fluß  der  Vorlesung  hineinzureden,  flüchtige \nBemerkungen  zu  machen,  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  erregen  und \nzu  fordern.  Nun  kommt  der  kleine  Saturn  in  die  größte \nVerlegenheit.  Er  ist  genötigt,  den  horizontalen  und  ver- \ntikalen Stand  der  Uhr  jeden  Augenblick  zu  verändern,  er \nbefindet  sich  im  Fall  der  bösen  Geister  im  Puppenspiel, \ndie  auf  das  schnell  wechselnde  Berlicke!  Berlocke!  des \nmutwilligen  Hanswursts  nicht  wissen,  wie  sie  gehen  oder \nkommen  sollen. \n\nWer  in  Kanzleien  hat  kollationieren  hören,  kann  sich  eine \nVorstellung  von  dieser  Vorlesung  machen,  schnell,  ein- \ntönig, aber  doch  artikuliert  und  deutlich  genug.  Der \nkunstreiche  Advokat  weiß  nun  durch  Scherze  die  Lange- \nweile zu  unterbrechen,  und  das  Publikum  ergötzt  sich  an \nseinen  Spaßen  in  ganz  unmäßigem  Gelächter.  Eines \nScherzes  muß  ich  gedenken,  des  auffallendsten  unter \ndenen,  die  ich  verstand.  Der  Vorleser  rezitierte  soeben \nein  Dokument,  wodurch  einer  jener  unrechtmäßig  ge- \nachteten Besitzer  über  die  fraglichen  Güter  disponierte. \nDer  Advokat  hieß  ihn  langsamer  lesen,  und  als  er  die \nWorte  deutlich  aussprach:  Ich  schenke^  ich  vermache^  fuhr \nder  Redner  heftig  auf  den  Schreiber  los  und  rief:  Was \nwillst  du  schenken?  was  vermachen?  du  armer  ausge- \nhungerter Teufel!  Gehört  dir  doch  gar  nichts  in  der  Welt \nan.  Doch,  fuhr  er  fort,  indem  er  sich  zu  besinnen  schien, \nwar  doch  jener  erlauchte  Besitzer  in  eben  dem  Fall,  er \nwollte  schenken,  wollte  vermachen,  was  ihm  so  wenig \ngehörte  als  dir.  Ein  unendlich  Gelächter  schlug  auf,  doch \nsogleich  nahm  die  Sanduhr* die  horizontale  Lage  wieder \nan.  Der  Vorleser  summte  fort,  machte  dem  Advokaten  ein \nflämisch  Gesicht;  doch  das  sind  alles  verabredete  Spaße. \n\nDen  4.  Oktober. \nGestern  war  ich  in  der  Komödie,  Theater  St.  Lukas,  die \nmir  viel  Freude  gemacht  hat:  ich  sah  ein  extemporiertes \n\nGOETHE  IV  6 \n\n\n82  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nStück  in  Masken,  mit  viel  Naturell,  Energie  und  Bravour \naufgeführt.  Freilich  sind  sie  nicht  alle  gleich;  der  Pan- \ntalon  sehr  brav,  die  eine  Frau,  stark  und  wohlgebaut, \nkeine  außerordentliche  Schauspielerin,  spricht  exzellent \nund  weiß  sich  zu  betragen.  Ein  tolles  Sujet,  demjenigen \nähnlich,  das  bei  uns  unter  dem  Titel  ''Der  Verschlag''  be- \nhandelt ist.  Mit  unglaublicher  Abwechslung  unterhielt  es \nmehr  als  drei  Stunden.  Doch  ist  auch  hier  das  Volk \nwieder  die  Base,  worauf  dies  alles  ruht:  die  Zuschauer \nspielen  mit,  und  die  Menge  verschmilzt  mit  dem  Theater \nin  ein  Ganzes.  Den  Tag  über  auf  dem  Platz  und  am \nUfer,  auf  den  Gondeln  und  im  Palast,  der  Käufer  und \nVerkäufer,  der  Bettler,  der  Schiffer,  die  Nachbarin,  der \nAdvokat  und  sein  Gegner,  alles  lebt  und  treibt  und  läßt \nsich  es  angelegen  sein,  spricht  und  beteuert,  schreit  und \nbietet  aus,  singt  und  spielt,  flucht  und  lärmt.  Und  abends \ngehen  sie  ins  Theater  und  sehen  und  hören  das  Leben \nihres  Tages,  künstlich  zusammengestellt,  artiger  aufge- \nstutzt, mit  Märchen  durchflochten,  durch  Masken  von  der \nWirklichkeit  abgerückt,  durch  Sitten  genähert.  Hierüber \nfreun  sie  sich  kindisch,  schreien  wieder,  klatschen  und \nlärmen.  Von  Nacht  zu  Nacht,  ja  von  Mitternacht  zu \nMitternacht  ist  immer  alles  eben  dasselbe. \nIch  habe  aber  auch  nicht  leicht  natürlicher  agieren  sehen \nals  jene  Masken,  so  wie  es  nur  bei  einem  ausgezeichnet \nglücklichen  Naturell  durch  längere  Übung  erreicht  werden \nkami. \n\nDa  ich  das  schreibe,  machen  sie  einen  gewaltigen  T^ärm \nauf  dem  Kanal  unter  meinem  Fenster,  und  Mitternacht  ist \nvorbei.  Sie  haben  im  Guten  und  Bösen  immer  etwas  zu- \nsammen. \n\nÖffentliche  Redner  habe  ich  nun  gehört:  drei  Kerls  auf \ndem  Platze  und  Ufersteindamme,  jeden  nach  seiner  Art \nGeschichten  erzählend,  sodann  zwei  Sachwalter,  zwei \nPrediger,  die  Schauspieler,  worunter  ich  besonders  den \nPantalon  rühmen  muß;  alle  diese  haben  etwas  Gemein- \nsames, sowohl  weil  sie  von  ein  und  derselben  Nation  sind, \ndie,  stets  öftentlich  lebend,  immer  in  leidenschaftlichem \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  83 \n\nSprechen  begriffen  ist,  als  auch  weil  sie  sich  untereinander \nnachahmen.  Hierzu  kommt  noch  eine  entschiedene  Ge- \nbärdensprache, mit  welcher  sie  die  Ausdrücke  ihrer  Inten- \ntionen, Gesinnungen  und  Empfindungen  begleiten. \nHeute  am  Fest  des  heiligen  Franziskus  war  ich  in  seiner \nKirche  alle  Vigne.  Des  Kapuziners  laute  Stimme  ward \nvon  dem  Geschrei  der  Verkäufer  vor  der  Kirche  wie  von \neiner  Antiphone  begleitet;  ich  stand  in  der  Kirchtüre \nzwischen  beiden,  und  es  war  wunderlich  genug  zu  hören. \n\nDen  j.  Oktober. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  im  Arsenal,  mir  immer  interessant \ngenug,  da  ich  noch  kein  Seewesen  kenne  und  hier  die \nuntere  Schule  besuchte:  denn  freilich  sieht  es  hier  nach \neiner  alten  Familie  aus,  die  sich  noch  rührt,  obgleich  die \nbeste  Zeit  der  Blüte  und  der  Früchte  vorüber  ist.  Da  ich \ndenn  auch  den  Handwerkern  nachgehe,  habe  ich  manches \nMerkwürdige  gesehen  und  ein  Schiff  von  vierundachtzig \nKanonen,  dessen  Gerippe  fertig  steht,  bestiegen. \nEin  gleiches  ist  vor  sechs  Monaten,  an  der  Riva  de' \nSchiavoni,  bis  aufs  Wasser  verbrannt;  die  Pulverkammer \nwar  nicht  sehr  gefüllt,  und  da  sie  sprang,  tat  es  keinen \ngroßen  Schaden.  Die  benachbarten  Häuser  büßten  ihre \nScheiben  ein. \n\nDas  schönste  Eichenholz,  aus  Istrien,  habe  ich  verarbeiten \nsehen  und  dabei  über  den  Wachstum  dieses  werten  Baumes \nmeine  stillen  Betrachtungen  angestellt.  Ich  kann  nicht \ngenug  sagen,  was  meine  sauer  erworbene  Kenntnis  natür- \nlicher Dinge,  die  doch  der  Mensch  zuletzt  als  Materialien \nbraucht  und  in  seinen  Nutzen  verwendet,  mir  überall  hilft, \num  mir  das  Verfahren  der  Künstler  und  Handwerker  zu \nerklären;  so  ist  mir  auch  die  Kenntnis  der  Gebirge  und \ndes  daraus  genommenen  Gesteins  ein  großer  Vorsprung \nin  der  Kunst. \n\nUm  mit  einem  Worte  den  Begriff  des  Bucentaur  auszu- \nsprechen, nenne  ich  ihn  eine  Prachtgaleere.  Der  ältere, \nvon  dem  wir  noch  Abbildungen  haben,  rechtfertigt  diese \n\n\n84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nBenennung  noch  mehr  als  der  gegenwärtige,  der  uns  durch \nseinen  Glanz  über  seinen  Ursprung  verblendet. \nIch  komme  immer  auf  mein  Altes  zurück.  Wenn  dem \nKünstler  ein  echter  Gegenstand  gegeben  ist,  so  kann  er \netwas  Echtes  leisten.  Hier  war  ihm  aufgetragen,  eine \nGaleere  zu  bilden,  die  wert  wäre,  die  Häupter  der  Repu- \nblik, am  feierlichsten  Tage,  zum  Sakrament  ihrer  herge- \nbrachten Meerherrschaft  zu  tragen,  und  diese  Aufgabe  ist \nfürtreft'lich  au.sgeführt.  Das  Schiff  ist  ganz  Zierat,  also \ndarf  man  nicht  sagen:  mit  Zierat  überladen;  ganz  ver- \nguldetes  Schnitzwerk,  sonst  zu  keinem  Gebrauch,  eine \nwahre  Monstranz,  um  dem  Volke  seine  Häupter  recht \nherrlich  zu  zeigen.  Wissen  wir  doch:  das  Volk,  wie  es \ngern  seine  Hüte  schmückt,  will  auch  seine  Obern  prächtig \nund  geputzt  sehen.  Dieses  Prunkschiff  ist  ein  rechtes  In- \nventarienstück,  woran  man  sehen  kann,  was  die  Vene- \nzianer waren  und  sich  zu  sein  dünkten. \n\nNac/its. \nIch  komme  noch  lachend  aus  der  Tragödie  und  muß \ndiesen  Scherz  gleich  auf  dem  Papier  befestigen.  Das \nStück  war  nicht  schlimm,  der  Verfasser  hatte  alle  tragischen \nMatadore  zusammengesteckt,  und  die  Schauspieler  hatten \ngut  spielen.  Die  meisten  Situationen  waren  bekannt, \neinige  neu  und  ganz  glücklich.  Zwei  Väter,  die  sich  hassen. \nSöhne  und  Töchter  aus  diesen  getrennten  Familien,  leiden- \nschaftlich übers  Kreuz  verliebt,  ja  das  eine  Paar  heimUch \nverheiratet.  Es  ging  wild  und  grausam  zu,  und  nichts \nblieb  zuletzt  übrig,  um  die  jungen  Leute  glücklich  zu \nmachen,  als  daß  die  beiden  Väter  sich  erstachen,  worauf \nunter  lebhaftem  Händeklatschen  der  Vorhang  fiel.  Nun \nward  aber  das  Klatschen  heftiger,  nun  wurde  Fuora  ge- \nrufen, und  das  so  lange,  bis  sich  die  zwei  Hauptpaare \nbequemten,  hinter  dem  Vorhang  hervorzukriechen,  ihre \nl)ücklinge  zu  machen  und  auf  der  andern  Seite  wieder  ab- \nzugehen. \n\nDas  Publikum  war  noch  nicht  befriedigt,  es  klatschte  fort \nund  rief  I  morti!  Das  dauerte  so  lange,  bis  die  zwei \nToten  auch  herauskamen  und  sich  bückten,  da  denn  einige \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  85 \n\nStimmen  riefen  Bravi  i  morti!  Sie  wurden  durch  Klatschen \nlange  festgehalten,  bis  man  ihnen  gleichfalls  endlich  ab- \nzugehen erlaubte.  Diese  Posse  gewinnt  für  den  Augen- \nund  Ohrenzeugen  unendlich,  der  das  Bravo!  Bravi!  das \ndie  Italiener  immer  im  Munde  führen,  so  in  den  Ohren \nhat  wie  ich,  und  dann  auf  einmal  auch  die  Toten  mit \ndiesem  Ehrenwort  anrufen  hört. \n\nGute  Nacht!  so  können  wir  Nordländer  zu  jeder  Stunde \nsagen,  wenn  wir  im  Finstern  scheiden;  der  Italiener  sagt \nFelicissima  notte!  nur  einmal,  und  zwar  wenn  das  Licht \nin  das  Zimmer  gebracht  wird,  indem  Tag  und  Nacht  sich \nscheiden,  und  da  heißt  es  denn  etwas  ganz  anderes.  So \nunübersetzlich  sind  die  Eigenheiten  jeder  Sprache:  denn \nvom  höchsten  bis  zum  tiefsten  Wort  bezieht  sich  alles \nauf  Eigentümlichkeiten  der  Nation,  es  sei  nun  in  Cha- \nrakter, Gesinnungen  oder  Zuständen. \n\nDc7i  6.  Oktober. \nDie  Tragödie  gestern  hat  mich  manches  gelehrt.  Erst- \nlich habe  ich  gehört,  wie  die  Italiener  ihre  eilfsilbigen \nJamben  behandeln  und  deklamieren;  dann  habe  ich  be- \ngriffen, wie  klug  Gozzi  die  Masken  mit  den  tragischen \nFiguren  verbunden  hat.  Das  ist  das  eigentliche  Schau- \nspiel für  dieses  Volk:  denn  es  will  auf  eine  krude  Weise \ngerührt  sein,  es  nimmt  keinen  innigen,  zärtlichen  Anteil \nam  Unglücklichen,  es  freut  sie  nur,  wenn  der  Held  gut \nspricht;  denn  aufs  Reden  halten  sie  viel,  sodann  aber \nwollen  sie  lachen  oder  etwas  Albernes  vornehmen. \nIhr  Anteil  am  Schauspiel  ist  nur  als  an  einem  Wirklichen. \nDa  der  Tyrann  seinem  Sohne  das  Schwert  reichte  und \nforderte,  daß  dieser  seine  eigne  gegenüberstehende  Ge- \nmahlin umbringen  sollte,  fing  das  Volk  laut  an,  sein  Miß- \nvergnügen über  diese  Zumutung  zu  beweisen,  und  es \nfehlte  nicht  viel,  so  wäre  das  Stück  unterbrochen  worden. \nSie  verlangten,  der  Alte  sollte  sein  Schwert  zurückneh- \nmen, wodurch  denn  freilich  die  folgenden  Situationen \ndes  Stücks  wären  aufgehoben  worden.  Endlich  entschloß \nsich  der  bedrängte  Sohn,  trat  ins  Proszenium  und  bat \ndemütig,   sie  möchten  sich  nur  noch  einen  Augenblick \n\n\n86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngedulden,  die  Sache  werde  noch  ganz  nach  Wunsch  ab- \nlaufen. Künstlerisch  genommen  aber  war  diese  Situation \nnach  den  Umständen  albern  und  unnatürlich,  und  ich  lobte \ndas  Volk  um  sein  Gefühl. \n\nJetzt  verstehe  ich  besser  die  langen  Reden  und  das  viele \nHin-  und  Herdissertieren  im  griechischen  Trauerspiele. \nDie  Athenienser  hörten  noch  lieber  reden  und  verstanden \nsich  noch  besser  darauf  als  die  Italiener;  vor  den  Ge- \nrichtsstellen, wo  sie  den  ganzen  Tag  lagen,  lernten  sie \nschon  etwas. \n\nAn  den  ausgeführten  Werken  Palladios,  besonders  an \nden  Kirchen,  habe  ich  manches  Tadelnswürdige  neben \ndem  Köstlichsten  gefunden.  Wenn  ich  nun  so  bei  mir \nüberlegte,  inwiefern  ich  recht  oder  unrecht  hätte  gegen \neinen  solchen  außerordentlichen  Mann,  so  war  es,  als  ob \ner  dabei  stünde  und  mir  sagte:  das  und  das  habe  ich \nwider  Willen  gemacht,  aber  doch  gemacht,  weil  ich  unter \nden  gegebenen  Umständen  nur  auf  diese  Weise  meiner \nhöchsten  Idee  am  näch.sten  kommen  konnte. \nMir  scheint,  soviel  ich  auch  darüber  denke,  er  habe  bei \nBetrachtung  der  Höhe  und  Breite  einer  schon  bestehenden \nKirche,  eines  altern  Hauses,  wozu  er  Fassaden  errichten \nsollte,  nur  überlegt:  wie  gibst  du  diesen  Räumen  die \ngrößte  Form.-  im  einzelnen  mußt  du,  wegen  eintretenden \nBedürfnisses,  etwas  verrücken  oder  verpfuschen,  da  oder \ndort  wird  eine  Unschicklichkeit  entstehen;  aber  das \nmag  sein,  das  Ganze  wird  einen  hohen  Stil  haben,  und \ndu  wirst  dir  zur  Freude  arbeiten. \n\nUnd  so  hat  er  das  größte  Bild,  das  er  in  der  Seele  trug, \nauch  dahin  gebracht,  wo  es  nicht  ganz  paßte,  wo  er  es \nim  einzelnen  zerknittern  und  verstümmeln  mußte. \nDer  Flügel  in  der  Caritä  dagegen  muß  uns  deshalb  von \nso  hohem  Werte  sein,  weil  der  Künstler  freie  Hand  hatte \nund  seinem  Geist  unbedingt  folgen  durfte.  Wäre  das \nKloster  fertig  geworden,  so  stünde  vielleicht  in  der  ganzen \ngegenwärtigen  Welt  kein  vollkommneres  Werk  der  Bau- \nkunst. \nWie  er  gedacht  und  wie  er  gearbeitet,  wird  mir  immer \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  87 \n\nklarer,  je  mehr  ich  seine  Werke  lese  und  dabei  betrachte, \nwie  er  die  Alten  behandelt;  denn  er  macht  wenig  Worte, \nsie  sind  aber  alle  gewichtig.  Das  vierte  Buch,  das  die \nantiken  Tempel  darstellt,  ist  eine  rechte  Einleitung,  die \nalten  Reste  mit  Sinn  zu  beschauen. \n\nDen  7.  Oktober. \nGestern  abend  sah  ich  Elektra  von  Crebillon,  auf  dem \nTheater  San  Crisostomo,  nämlich  übersetzt.  Was  mir  das \nStück  abgeschmackt  vorkam  und  wie  es  mir  fürchterlich \nLangeweile  machte,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen. \nDie  Akteurs  sind  übrigens  brav  und  wissen  das  Publikum \nmit  einzelnen  Stellen  abzuspeisen!  Orest  hat  allein  drei \nverschiedene  Erzählungen,  poetisch  aufgestutzt,  in  eii?cr \nSzene.  Elektra,  ein  hübsches  Weibchen  von  mittlerer \nGröße  und  Stärke  und  fast  französischer  Lebhaftigkeit, \neinem  guten  Anstand,  spricht  die  Verse  schön;  nur  be- \ntrug sie  sich  von  Anfang  bis  zu  Ende  toll,  wie  es  leider \ndie  Rolle  verlangt.  Indessen  habe  ich  doch  wieder  ge- \nlernt. Der  italienische,  immer  eilfsilbige  Jambe  hat  für \ndie  Deklamation  große  Unbequemlichkeit,  weil  die  letzte \nSilbe  durchaus  kurz  ist  und,  wider  Willen  des  Deklama- \ntors, in  die  Höhe  schlägt. \n\nHeute  früh  war  ich  bei  dem  Hochamte,  welchem  der \nDoge  jährlich  an  diesem  Tage,  wegen  eines  alten  Siegs \nüber  die  Türken,  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen  Justina  bei- \nwohnen muß.  Wenn  an  dem  kleinen  Platz  die  vergolde- \nten Barken  landen,  die  den  Fürsten  und  einen  Teil  des \nAdels  bringen,  seltsam  gekleidete  Schiffer  sich  mit  rot \ngemalten  Bmdern  bemühen,  am  Ufer  die  Geistlichkeit,  die \nBrüdersch:ni\"ten  mit  angezündeten,  auf  Stangen  und  trag- \nbare silbeere  Leuchter  gesteckten  Kerzen  stehen,  drängen, \nwogen  'raue  warten,  dann  mit  Teppichen  beschlagene \nBrücker  Rühiden  Fahrzeugen  ans  Land  gestreckt  werden, \nzuerst  lein  Angen  violetten  Kleider  der  Savj,  dann  die \nlangersce,  e  der  Senatoren  sich  auf  dem  Pflaster  ent- \nfalten jhte,  da:  der  Alte,  mit  goldener  phrygischer  Mütze \ngeschilalamocan  längsten  goldenen  Talar,  mit  dem  Her- \n\n\n88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nmelinmantel,  aussteigt,  drei  Diener  sich  seiner  Schleppe \nbemächtigen,  alles  auf  einem  kleinen  Platz  vor  dem  Portal \neiner  Kirche,  vor  deren  Türen  die  Türkenfahnen  gehal- \nten werden,  so  glaubt  man  auf  einmal  eine'  alte  gewirkte \nTapete  zu  sehen,  aber  recht  gut  gezeichnet  und  koloriert. \nMir  nordischem  Flüchtling  hat  diese  Zeremonie  viele \nFreude  gemacht.  Bei  uns,  wo  alle  Feierlichkeiten  kurz- \nröckig  sind  und  wo  die  größte,  die  man  sich  denken  kann, \nmit  dem  Gewehr  auf  der  Schulter  begangen  wird,  möchte \nso  etwas  nicht  am  Ort  sein.  Aber  hierher  gehören  diese \nSchleppröcke,  diese  friedlichen  Begehungen. \nDer  Doge  ist  ein  gar  schön  gewachsener  und  schön  ge- \nbildeter Mann,  der  krank  sein  mag,  sich  aber  nur  noch \nso,  um  der  Würde  willen,  unter  dem  schweren  Rocke \ngerade  hält.  Sonst  sieht  er  aus  wie  der  Großpapa  des \nganzen  Geschlechts  und  ist  gar  hold  und  leutselig;  die \nKleidung  steht  sehr  gut,  das  Käppchen  unter  der  Mütze \nbeleidigt  nicht,  indem  es,  ganz  fein  und  dui-chsichtig,  auf \ndem  weißesten,  klarsten  Haar  von  der  Welt  ruht. \nEtwa  fünfzig  Nobili,  in  langen  dunkelroten  Schleppklei- \ndern, waren  mit  ihm,  meist  schöne  Männer,  keine  einzige \nvertrackte  Gestalt,  mehrere  groß,  mit  großen  Köpfen, \ndenen  die  blonden  Lockenperücken  wohl  ziemten;  vorge- \nbaute Gesichter,  weiches,  weißes  Fleisch,  ohne  schwam- \nmig und  widerwärtig  auszusehen,  vielmehr  klug,  ohne \nAnstrengung,  ruhig,  ihrer  selbst  gewiß,  Leichtigkeit  des \nDaseins  und  durchaus  eine  gewisse  Fröhlichkeit. \nWie  sich  alles  in  der  Kirche  rangiert  hatte  und  das \nHochamt  anfing,  zogen  die  Brüderschaften  zur  Haupttüre \nherein  und  zur  rechten  Seitentüre  wieder  hinaus,  nach- \ndem sie,  Paar  für  Paar,  das  Weihwasser  empfangen  und \nsich  gegen  den  Hochaltar,  den  Dogen  und  den(  Adel  ge- \nneigt hatten.  i \n\nAuf  heute  abend  hatte  ich  mir  den  famosen  Gesang  der \nSchiffer  bestellt,  die  den  Tasso  und  Ariost  auf  ihre  eignen \nMelodien  singen.  Dieses  muß  wirklich  bestellt  werden, \nes  kommt  nicht  gewöhnlich  vor,  es  gehört  vielmehr  zu \nden  halbverklungenen  Sagen  der  Vorzeit.    Bei  Monden- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  89 \n\nschein  bestieg  ich  eine  Gondel,  den  einen  Sänger  vorn, \nden  andern  hinten;  sie  fingen  ihr  Lied  an  und  sangen \nabwechselnd  Vers  für  Vers.  Die  Melodie,  welche  wir \ndurch  Rousseau  kennen,  ist  eine  Mittelart  zwischen  Choral \nund  Rezitativ,  sie  behält  immer  denselben  Gang,  ohne \nTakt  zu  haben;  die  Modulation  ist  auch  dieselbige,  nur \nverändern  sie,  nach  dem  Inhalt  des  Verses,  mit  einer  Art \nvon  Deklamation  sowohl  Ton  als  Maß;  der  Geist  aber, \ndas  Leben  davon,  läßt  sich  begreifen  wie  folgt. \nAuf  welchem  Wege  sich  die  Melodie  gemacht  hat,  will \nich  nicht  untersuchen,  genug,  sie  paßt  gar  trefflich  für \neinen  müßigen  Menschen,  der  sich  etwas  vormoduliert \nund  Gedichte,  die  er  auswendig  kann,  solchem  Gesang \nunterschiebt. \n\nMit  einer  durchdringenden  Stimme — das  Volk  schätzt \nStärke  vor  allem — sitzt  er  am  Ufer  einer  Insel,  eines \nKanals,  auf  einer  Barke  und  läßt  sein  Lied  schallen,  so \nweit  er  kann.  Über  den  stillen  Spiegel  verbreitet  sich's. \nIn  der  Ferne  vernimmt  es  ein  anderer,  der  die  Melodie \nkennt,  die  Worte  versteht  und  mit  dem  folgenden  Verse \nantwortet;  hierauf  erwidert  der  erste,  und  so  ist  einer \nimmer  das  Echo  des  andern.  Der  Gesang  währt  Nächte \ndurch,  unterhält  sie,  ohne  zu  ermüden.  Je  ferner  sie  also \nvoneinander  sind,  desto  reizender  kann  das  Lied  werden; \nwenn  der  Hörer  alsdann  zwischen  beiden  steht,  so  ist  er \nam  rechten  Flecke. \n\nUm  dieses  mich  vernehmen  zu  lassen,  stiegen  sie  am \nUfer  der  Giudecca  aus;  sie  teilten  sich  am  Kanal  hin,  ich \nging  zwischen  ihnen  auf  und  ab,  so  daß  ich  immer  den \nverließ,  der  zu  singen  anfangen  sollte,  und  mich  dem- \njenigen wieder  näherte,  der  aufgehört  hatte.  Da  ward \nmir  der  Sinn  des  Gesangs  erst  aufgeschlossen.  Als  Stimme \naus  der  Feme  klingt  es  höchst  sonderbar,  wie  eine  Klage \nohne  Trauer;  es  ist  darin  etwas  unglaublich,  bis  zu \nTränen  Rührendes.  Ich  schrieb  es  meiner  Stimmung  zu; \naber  mein  Alter  sagte:  6  singolare,  come  quel  canto  in- \ntenerisce,  e  molto  piü,  quando  e  piü  ben  cantato.  Er \nwünschte,  daß  ich  die  Weiber  vom  Lido,  besonders  die \nvon  Malamocco  und  Palestrina  hören  möchte;  auch  diese \n\n\n90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsängen  den  Tasso  auf  gleiche  und  ähnliche  Melodien. \nEr  sagte  ferner:  Sie  haben  die  Gewohnheit,  wenn  ihre \nMänner  aufs  Fischen  ins  Meer  sind,  sich  ans  Ufer  zu \nsetzen  und  mit  durchdringender  Stimme  abends  diese \nGesänge  erschallen  zu  lassen,  bis  sie  auch  von  ferne  die \nStimme  der  Ihrigen  vernehmen  und  sich  so  mit  ihnen \nunterhalten.  Ist  das  nicht  sehr  schön  .>  Und  doch  läßt \nsich  wohl  denken,  daß  ein  Zuhörer  in  der  Nähe  wenig \nFreude  an  solchen  Stimmen  haben  möchte,  die  mit  den \nWellen  des  Meeres  kämpfen.  Menschlich  aber  und  wahr \nwird  der  Begriff  dieses  Gesanges,  lebendig  wird  die \nMelodie,  über  deren  tote  Buchstaben  wir  uns  sonst  den \nKopf  zerbrochen  haben.  Gesang  ist  es  eines  Einsamen  in \ndie  Ferne  und  Weite,  damit  ein  anderer,  Gleichgestimm- \nter, höre  und  antworte. \n\nDen  8.  Oktober. \nDen  Palast  Pisani  Moretta  besuchte  ich  wegen  eines  köst- \nlichen Bildes  von  Paul  Veronese.     Die  weibliche  Familie \ndes  Darius  kniet  vor  Alexandern  und  Hephästion:    die \nvoranknieende  Mutter  hält  den  letztern  für  den  König; \ner  lehnt  es  ab  und  deutet  auf  den  Rechten.    Man  erzählt \ndas  Märchen,  der  Künstler  sei  in  diesem  Palast  gut  auf- \ngenommen und  längere  Zeit  ehrenvoll  bewirtet  worden, \ndagegen  habe  er  das  Bild  heimlich  gemalt  und,  als  Ge- \nschenk, zusammengerollt  unter  das  Bett  geschoben.    Es \nverdient  allerdings  einen  besondern  Ursprung  zu  haben, \ndenn  es  gibt  einen  Begriff  von  dem  ganzen  Werte  des \nMeisters.     Seine  große  Kunst,   ohne  einen  allgemeinen \nTon,    der   über  das   ganze  Stück   gezogen  wäre,  durch \nkunstreich  verteiltes  Licht  und  Schatten  und  ebenso  weis- \nlich abwechselnde  Lokalfarben  die  köstlichste  Harmonie \nhervorzubringen,  ist  hier  recht  sichtbar,  da  das  Bild  voll- \nkommen erhalten  und  frisch,  wie  von  gestern    vor  uns \nsteht:  denn  freilich,  sobald  ein  Gemälde  dieser  Art  ge- \nlitten hat,  wird  unser  Genuß  sogleich  getrübt,  ohne  daß \nwir  wissen,  was  die  Ursache  sei. \n\nWer    mit  dem    Künstler   wegen   des  Kostüms   rechten \nwollte,  der  dürfte  sich  nur  sagen,  es  habe  eine  Geschichte \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  91 \n\ndes  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  gemalt  werden  sollen,  und \nso  ist  alles  abgetan.  Die  Abstufung  von  der  Mutter  durch \nGemahlin  und  Töchter  ist  höchst  wahr  und  glücklich;  die \njüngste  Prinzeß,  ganz  am  Ende  knieend,  ist  ein  hübsches \nMäuschen  und  hat  ein  gar  artiges,  eigensinniges,  trotziges \nGesichtchen,  ihre  Lage  scheint  ihr  gar  nicht  zu  gefallen. \n\nMeine  alte  Gabe,  die  Welt  mit  Augen  desjenigen  Malers \nzu  sehen,  dessen  Bilder  ich  mir  eben  eingedrückt,  brachte \nmich  auf  einen  eignen  Gedanken.  Es  ist  offenbar,  daß \nsich  das  Auge  nach  den  Gegenständen  bildet,  die  es  von \nJugend  auf  erblickt,  und  so  muß  der  venezianische  Maler \nalles  klarer  und  heiterer  sehn  als  andere  Menschen.  Wir, \ndie  wir  auf  einem  bald  schmutzkotigen,  bald  staubigen, \nfarblosen,  die  Widerscheine  verdüsternden  Boden,  und \nvielleicht  gar  in  engen  Gemächern  leben,  können  einen \nsolchen  Frohblick  aus  uns  selbst  nicht  entwickeln. \nAls  ich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  durch  die  Lagunen \nfuhr  und  auf  den  Gondelrändern  die  Gondoliere  leicht \nschwebend,  buntbekleidet,  rudernd  betrachtete,  wie  sie \nauf  der  hellgrünen  Fläche  sich  in  der  blauen  Luft  zeich- \nneten, so  sah  ich  das  beste,  frischeste  Bild  der  venezia- \nnischen Schule.  Der  Sonnenschein  hob  die  Lokalfarben \nblendend  hervor,  und  die  Schattenseiten  waren  so  licht, \ndaß  sie  verhältnismäßig  wieder  zu  Lichtern  hätten  dienen \nkönnen.  Ein  gleiches  galt  von  den  Widerscheinen  des \nmeergrünen  Wassers.  Alles  war  hell  in  hell  gemalt,  so \ndaß  die  schäumende  Welle  und  die  Blitzlichter  darauf \nnötig  waren,  um  die  Tüpfchen  aufs  i  zu  setzen. \nTizian  und  Paul  hatten  diese  Klarheit  im  höchsten  Grade, \nund  wo  man  sie  in  ihren  Werken  nicht  findet,  hat  das \nBild  verloren  oder  ist  aufgemalt. \n\nDie  Kuppeln  und  Gewölbe  der  Markuskirche,  nebst  ihren \nSeitenflächen,  alles  ist  bilderreich,  alles  bunte  Figuren \nauf  goldenem  Grunde,  alles  musivische  Arbeit;  einige \nsind  recht  gut,  andere  gering,  je  nachdem  die  Meister \nwaren,  die  den  Karton  verfertigten. \nEs  fiel  mir  recht  aufs  Herz,  daß  doch  alles  auf  die  erste \nErfindung  ankommt  und  daß  diese  das  rechte  Maß,  den \n\n\n92  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nwahren  Geist  habe,  da  man  mit  viereckten  Stückchen \nGlas,  und  hier  nicht  einmal  auf  die  sauberste  Weise,  das \nGute  sowohl  als  das  Schlechte  nachbilden  kann.  Die \nKunst,  welche  dem  Alten  seine  Fußboden  bereitete,  dem \nChristen  seine  Kirchenhimmel  wölbte,  hat  sich  jetzt  auf \nDosen  und  Armbänder  verkrümelt.  Diese  Zeiten  sind \nschlechter,  als  man  denkt. \n\nIn  dem  Hause  Farsetti  ist  eine  kostbare  Sammlung  von \nAbgüssen  der  besten  Antiken.  Ich  schweige  von  denen, \ndie  ich  von  Mannheim  her  und  sonst  schon  gekannt,  und \nerwähne  nur  neuere  Bekanntschaften.  Eine  Kleopatra  in \nkolossaler  Ruhe,  die  Aspis  um  den  Arm  geschlungen  und \nin  den  Tod  hinüberschlafend;  ferner  die  Mutter  Niobe, \ndie  ihre  jüngste  Tochter  mit  dem  Mantel  vor  den  Pfeilen \ndes  Apollo  deckt;  sodann  einige  Gladiatoren,  ein  in  sei- \nnen Flügeln  ruhender  Genius,  sitzende  und  stehende \nPhilosophen. \n\nEs  sind  Werke,  an  denen  sich  die  Welt  Jahrtausende \nfreuen  und  bilden  kann,  ohne  den  Wert  des  Künstlers \ndurch  Gedanken  zu  erschöpfen. \n\nViele  bedeutende  Büsten  versetzen  mich  in  die  alten \nherrlichen  Zeiten.  Nur  fühle  ich  leider,  wie  weit  ich  in \ndiesen  Kenntnissen  zurück  bin;  doch  es  wird  vorwärts \ngehen,  wenigstens  weiß  ich  den  Weg.  Palladio  hat  mir \nihn  auch  dazu,  und  zu  aller  Kunst  und  Leben  geöffnet. \nEs  klingt  das  vielleicht  ein  wenig  wunderlich,  aber  doch \nnicht  so  paradox,  als  wenn  Jakob  Böhme  bei  Erblickung \neiner  zinnernen  Schüssel  durch  Einstrahlung  Jovis  über \ndas  Universum  erleuchtet  wurde.  Auch  steht  in  dieser \nSammlung  ein  Stück  des  Gebälks  vom  Tempel  des  An- \ntonius und  der  Faustina  in  Rom.  Die  vorspringende \nGegenwart  dieses  herrlichen  Architekturgebildes  erinnerte \nmich  an  das  Kapital  des  Pantheon  in  Mannheim.  Das  ist \nfreilich  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  kauzenden,  auf  Krag- \nsteinlein übereinander  geschichteten  Heiligen  der  goti- \nschen Zierweisen,  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  Tabakspfeifen - \nSäulen,  spitze  Türmlein  und  Blumenzacken;  diese  bin  ich \nnun,  Gott  sei  Dank,  auf  ewig  los! \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  93 \n\nNoch  will  ich  einiger  Werke  der  Bildhauerkunst  erwähnen, \ndie  ich  diese  Tage  her,  zwar  nur  im  Vorbeigehen,  aber \ndoch  mit  Erstaunen  und  Erbauung  betrachtet:  zwei  un- \ngeheure Löwen,  von  weißem  Marmor,  vor  dem  Tore  des \nArsenals;  der  eine  sitzt  aufgerichtet,  auf  die  Vorder- \npfoten gestemmt,  der  andere  liegt — herrliche  Gegenbilder \nvon  lebendiger  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Sie  sind  so  groß,  daß \nsie  alles  umher  klein  machen  und  daß  man  selbst  zu- \nnichte würde,  wenn  erhabene  Gegenstände  uns  nicht  er- \nhüben. Sie  sollen  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit  und \nvom  Piraeus  in  den  glänzenden  Tagen  der  Republik  hier- \nher gebracht  sein. \n\nAus  Athen  mögen  gleichfalls  ein  paar  Basreliefe  stam- \nmen, in  dem  Tempel  der  heiligen  Justina,  der  Türken- \nbesiegerin,  eingemauert,  aber  leider  durch  Kirchstühle \neinigermaßen  verfinstert.  Der  Küster  machte  mich  auf- \nmerksam darauf,  weil  die  Sage  gehe,  daß  Tizian  seine \nunendlich  schönen  Engel  im  Bilde,  die  Ermordung  des \nheiligen  Petrus  Martyr  vorstellend,  darnach  geformt  habe. \nEs  sind  Genien,  welche  sich  mit  Attributen  der  Götter \nschleppen,  freilich  so  schön,  daß  es  allen  Begriff  über- \nsteigt. \n\nSodann  betrachtete  ich  mit  ganz  eignem  Gefühl  die \nnackte  kolossale  Statue  des  Markus  Agrippa,  in  dem  Hofe \neines  Palastes;  ein  sich  ihm  zur  Seite  heraufschlängeln- \nder Delphin  deutet  auf  einen  Seehelden.  Wie  doch  eine \nsolche  heroische  Darstellung  den  reinen  Menschen  Göt- \ntern ähnlich  macht! \n\nDie  Pferde  auf  der  Markuskirche  besah  ich  in  der  Nähe. \nVon  unten  hinauf  bemerkt  man  leicht,  daß  sie  fleckig \nsind,  teils  einen  schönen  gelben  Metallglanz  haben,  teils \nkupfergrünlich  angelaufen.  In  der  Nähe  sieht  und  erfährt \nman,  daß  sie  ganz  verguldet  waren,  und  sieht  sie  über \nund  über  mit  Striemen  bedeckt,  da  die  Barbaren  das \nGold  nicht  abfeilen,  sondern  abhauen  wollten.  Auch  das \nist  gut,  so  blieb  wenigstens  die  Gestalt. \nEin  herrlicher  Zug  Pferde!  ich  möchte  einen  rechten \nPferdekenner  darüber  reden  hören.     Was  mir  sonderbar \n\n\n94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nscheint,  ist,  daß  sie  in  der  Nähe  schwer  und  unten  vom \nPlatz  leicht  wie  die  Hirsche  aussehen. \n\nIch  fuhr  heute  früh  mit  meinem  Schutzgeiste  aufs  Lido, \nauf  die  Erdzunge,  welche  die  Lagunen  schließt  und  sie \nvom  Meere  absondert.  Wir  stiegen  aus  und  gingen  quer \nüber  die  Zunge.  Ich  hörte  ein  starkes  Geräusch:  es  war \n(las  Meer,  und  ich  sah  es  bald,  es  ging  hoch  gegen  das \nUfer,  indem  es  sich  zurückzog,  es  war  um  Mittag,  Zeit \nder  Ebbe.  So  habe  ich  denn  auch  das  Meer  mit  Augen \ngesehen  und  bin  auf  der  schönen  Tenne,  die  es  weichend \nzurückläßt,  ihm  nachgegangen.  Da  hätte  ich  mir  die \nKinder  gewünscht,  um  der  Muscheln  willen;  ich  habe, \nselbst  kindisch,  ihrer  genug  aufgelesen;  doch  widme  ich \nsie  zu  einigem  Gebrauch:  ich  möchte  von  der  Feuchtig- \nkeit des  Tintenfisches,  die  hier  so  häufig  wegfließt,  etwas \neintrocknen. \n\nAuf  dem  Lido,  nicht  weit  vom  Meer,  liegen  Engländer \nbegraben,  und  weiterhin  Juden,  die  beiderseits  in  ge- \nweihtem Boden  nicht  ruhen  sollten.  Ich  fand  das  Grab \ndes  edlen  Konsul  Smith  und  seiner  ersten  Frauen;  ich \nbin  ihm  mein  Exemplar  des  Palladio  schuldig  und  dankte \nihm  auf  seinem  ungeweihten  Grabe  dafür, \nlind  nicht  allein  ungeweiht,  sondern  halbverschüttet  ist \ndas  Grab.  Das  Lido  ist  immer  nur  wie  eine  Düne  anzu- \nsehen; der  Sand  wird  dorthin  geführt,  vom  Winde  hin \nund  her  getrieben,  aufgehäuft,  überall  angedrängt.  In \nweniger  Zeit  wird  man  das  ziemlich  erhöhte  Monument \nkaum  wiederfinden  können. \n\nDas  Meer  ist  doch  ein  großer  Anblick!  Ich  will  sehen, \nin  einem  Fischerkahn  eine  Fahrt  zu  tun:  die  Gondeln \nwagen  sich  nicht  hinaus. \n\nAm  Meere  habe  ich  auch  verschiedene  Pflanzen  gefun- \nden, deren  ähnlicher  Charakter  mir  ihre  Eigenschaften \nnäher  kennen  ließ:  sie  sind  alle  zugleich  mastig  und \nstreng,  saftig  und  zäh,  und  es  ist  offenbar,  daß  das  alte \nSalz  des  Sandbodens,  mehr  aber  die  salzige  Luft  ihnen \ndiese  Eigenschaften  gibt;    sie  strotzen  von  Säften,  wie \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  95 \n\nWasserpflanzen,  sie  sind  fest  und  zäh,  wie  Bergpflanzen; \nwenn  ihre  Blätterenden  eine  Neigung  zu  Stacheln  haben, \nwie  Disteln  tun,  sind  sie  gewaltig  spitz  und  stark.  Ich \nfand  einen  solchen  Busch  Blätter;  es  schien  mir  unser \nunschuldiger  Huflattich,  hier  aber  mit  scharfen  Wafien \nbewatihet,  und  das  Blatt  wie  Leder,  so  auch  die  Samen- \nkapseln, die  Stiele,  alles  mastig  und  fest.  Ich  bringe \nSamen  mit  und  eingelegte  Blätter  (Eryngium  mari- \ntimum). \n\nDer  Fischmarkt  und  die  unendlichen  Seeprodukte  machen \nmir  viel  Vergnügen;  ich  gehe  oft  darüber  und  beleuchte \ndie  unglücklichen  aufgehaschten  Meeresbewohner. \n\nDen  g.  Oktober. \nEin  köstlicher  Tag,  vom  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht!  Ich \nfuhr  bis  Palestrina  gegen  Chiozza  über,  wo  die  großen \nBaue  sind,  Murazzi  genannt,  welche  die  Republik  gegen \ndas  Meer  aufführen  läßt.  Sie  sind  von  gehauenen  Stei- \nnen und  sollen  eigentlich  die  lange  Erdzunge,  Lido  ge- \nnannt, welche  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere  trennt,  vor \ndiesem  wilden  Elemente  schützen. \n\nDie  Lagunen  sind  eine  Wirkung  der  alten  Natur.  Erst \nEbbe,  Flut  und  Erde,  gegeneinander  arbeitend,  dann \ndas  allmähliche  Sinken  des  Urgewässers  waren  Ursache, \ndaß  am  obern  Ende  des  Adriatischen  Meeres  sich  eine \nansehnliche  Sumpfstrecke  befindet,  welche  von  der  Flut \nbesucht,  von  der  Ebbe  zum  Teil  verlassen  wird.  Die \nKunst  hat  sich  der  höchsten  Stellen  bemächtigt,  und  so \nliegt  Venedig,  von  hundert  Inseln  zusammen  gruppiert \nund  von  hunderten  umgeben.  Zugleich  hat  man,  mit  un- \nglaublicher Anstrengung  und  Kosten,  tiefe  Kanäle  in  den \nSumpf  gefurcht,  damit  man  auch  zur  Zeit  der  Ebbe  mit \nKriegsschiffen  an  die  Hauptstellen  gelangen  könne.  Was \nMenschenwitz  und  Fleiß  vor  alters  ersonnen  und  ausge- \nführt, muß  Klugheit  und  Fleiß  nun  erhalten.  Das  Lido, \nein  langer  Erdstreif,  trennt  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere, \nwelches  nur  an  zwei  Orten  hereintreten  kann,  bei  dem \nKastell  nämlich  und  am  entgegengesetzten  Ende,  bei \nChiozza.     Die  Flut  tritt  gewöhnlich  des  Tages  zweimal \n\n\n96  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nherein,  und  die  Ebbe  bringt  das  Wasser  zweimal  hinaus, \nimmer  durch  denselben  Weg  in  denselben  Richtungen. \nDie  Flut  bedeckt  die  innern  morastigen  Stellen  und  läßt \ndie  erhühteren,  wo  nicht  trocken,  doch  sichtbar. \nGanz  anders  wäre  es,  wenn  das  Meer  sich  neue  Wege \nsuchte,  die  Erdzunge  angriffe  und  nach  Willkür  hinein \nund  heraus  flutete.  Nicht  gerechnet,  daß  die  Örtchen \nauf  dem  Lido,  Palestrina,  St.  Peter  und  andere,  unter- \ngehen müßten,  so  würden  auch  jene  Kommunikations- \nkanäle ausgefüllt  und,  indem  das  Wasser  alles  durchein- \nander schlemmte,  das  Lido  zu  Inseln,  die  Inseln,  die \njetzt  dahinterliegen,  zu  Erdzungen  verwandelt  werden. \nDieses  zu  verhüten,  müssen  sie  das  Lido  verwahren,  was \nsie  können,  damit  das  Element  nicht  dasjenige  willkür- \nlich angreifen,  hinüber  und  herüber  werfen  möge,  was \ndie  Menschen  schon  in  Besitz  genommen,  dem  sie  schon \nzu  einem  gewissen  Zweck  Gestalt  und  Richtung  gegeben \nhaben. \n\nBei  außerordentlichen  Fällen,  wenn  das  Meer  übermäßig \nwächst,  ist  es  besonders  gut,  daß  es  nur  an  zwei  Orten \nherein  darf  und  das  übrige  geschlossen  bleibt;  es  kann \nalso  doch  nicht  mit  der  größten  Gewalt  eindringen  und \nmuß  sich  in  einigen  Stunden  dem  Gesetz  der  Ebbe  unter- \nwerfen und  seine  Wut  mindern. \n\nÜbrigens  hat  Venedig  nichts  zu  besorgen:  die  Langsam- \nkeit, mit  der  das  Meer  abnimmt,  gibt  ihr  Jahrtausende \nZeit,  und  sie  werden  schon,  den  Kanälen  klug  nach- \nhelfend, sich  im  Besitz  zu  erhalten  suchen. \nWenn  sie  ihre  Stadt  nur  reinlicher  hielten,  welches  so \nnotwendig  als  leicht  ist  und  wirklich,  auf  die  Folge  von \nJahrhunderten,  von  großer  Konsequenz.  Nun  ist  zwar \nbei  großer  Strafe  verboten,  nichts  in  die  Kanäle  zu \nschütten  noch  Kehricht  hineinzuwerfen;  einem  schnell \neinfallenden  Regenguß  aber  ist's  nicht  untersagt,  allen \nden  in  die  Ecken  geschobnen  Kehricht  aufzurühren,  in \ndie  Kanäle  zu  schleppen,  ja,  was  noch  schlimmer  ist,  in \ndie  Abzüge  zu  führen,  die  nur  zum  Abfluß  des  Wassers \nbestimmt  sind,  und  sie  dergestalt  zu  verschlemmen,  daß \ndie  Hauptplätze  in  Gefahr  sind,  unter  Wasser  zu  stehen. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  97 \n\nSelbst  einige  Abzüge  auf  dem  kleinen  Markusplatze,  die, \nwie  auf  dem  großen,  gar  klug  angelegt  sind,  habe  ich \nverstopft  und  voll  Wasser  gesehen. \n\nWenn  ein  Tag  Regenwetter  einfällt,  ist  ein  unleidlicher \nKot;  alles  flucht  und  schimpft,  man  besudelt  beim  Auf- \nund  Absteigen  der  Brücken  die  Mäntel,  die  Tabarros, \nwomit  man  sich  ja  das  ganze  Jahr  schleppt,  und  da  alles \nin  Schuh  und  Strümpfen  läuft,  bespritzt  man  sich  und \nschilt;  denn  man  hat  sich  nicht  mit  gemeinem,  sondern \nbeizendem  Kot  besudelt.  Das  Wetter  wird  wieder  schön, \nund  kein  Mensch  denkt  an  Reinlichkeit.  Wie  wahr  ist  es \ngesagt:  das  Publikum  beklagt  sich  immer,  daß  es  schlecht \nbedient  sei,  und  weiß  es  nicht  anzufangen,  besser  be- \ndient zu  werden.  Hier,  wenn  der  Souverän  wollte,  könnte \nalles  gleich  getan  sein. \n\nHeute  abend  ging  ich  auf  den  Markustumi;  denn  da  ich \nneulich  die  Lagunen  in  ihrer  Herrlichkeit,  zur  Zeit  der \nFlut,  von  oben  gesehen,  wollt'  ich  sie  auch  zur  Zeit  der \nEbbe,  in  ihrer  Demut,  schauen,  und  es  ist  notwendig, \ndiese  beiden  Bilder  zu  verbinden,  wenn  man  einen  rich- \ntigen Begrift\"  haben  will.  Es  sieht  sonderbar  aus,  ringsum \nüberall  Land  erscheinen  zu  sehen,  wo  vorher  Wasser- \nspiegel war.  Die  Inseln  sind  nicht  mehr  Inseln,  nur \nhöher  bebaute  Flecke  eines  großen  graugrünlichen  Mo- \nrastes, den  schöne  Kanäle  durchschneiden.  Der  sumpfige \nTeil  ist  mit  Wasserpflanzen  bewachsen  und  muß  sich  auch \ndadurch  nach  imd  nach  erheben,  obgleich  Ebbe  und  Flut \nbeständig  daran  rupfen  und  wühlen  und  der  Vegetation \nkeine  Ruhe  lassen. \n\nIch  wende  mich  mit  meiner  Erzählung  nochmals  ans  Meer. \nDort  habe  ich  heute  die  Wirtschaft  der  Seeschnecken,  Pa- \ntellen und  Taschenkrebse  gesehen  und  mich  herzlich  dar- \nüber gefreut.  Was  ist  doch  ein  Lebendiges  für  ein  köst- \nliches, herrliches  Ding!  wie  abgemessen  zu  seinem  Zu- \nstande, wie  wahr,  wie  seiend!  Wie  viel  nützt  mir  nicht  mein \nbißchen  Studium  der  Natur,  und  wie  freue  ich  mich,  es \nfortzusetzen!  Doch  ich  will,  da  es  sich  mitteilen  läßt,  die \nFreunde  nicht  mit  bloßen  Ausrufungen  anreizen. \n\nGOETHE  IV  7 \n\n\n98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  dem  Meere  entgegengebauten  Mauerwerke  bestehen \nerst  aus  einigen  steilen  Stufen,  dann  kommt  eine  sacht \nansteigende  Fläche,  sodann  wieder  eine  Stufe,  abermals \neine  sanft  ansteigende  Fläche,  dann  eine  steile  Mauer \nmit  einem  oben  überhängenden  Kopfe.  Diese  Stufen,  diese \nFlächen  hinan  steigt  nun  das  flutende  Meer,  bis  es,  in \naußerordentlichen  Fällen,  endlich  oben  an  der  Mauer \nund  deren  Vorsprung  zerschellt. \n\nDem  Meere  folgen  seine  Bewohner,  kleine  eßbare  Schnek- \nken,  einschalige  Patellen,  und  was  sonst  noch  beweg- \nlich ist,  besonders  die  Taschenkrebse.  Kaum  aber  haben \ndiese  Tiere  an  den  glatten  Mauern  Besitz  genommen,  so \nzieht  sich  schon  das  Meer,  weichend  und  schwellend,  wie \nes  gekommen,  wieder  zurück.  Anfangs  weiß  das  Ge- \nwimmel nicht,  woran  es  ist,  und  hoftt  immer,  die  salzige \nFlut  soll  wiederkehren;  allein  sie  bleibt  aus,  die  Sonne \nsticht  und  trocknet  schnell,  und  nun  geht  der  Rückzug \nan.  Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  suchen  die  Taschenkrebse \nihren  Raub.  Wunderlicher  und  komischer  kann  man \nnichts  sehen  als  die  Gebärden  dieser  aus  einem  runden \nKörper  und  zwei  langen  Scheren  bestehenden  Geschöpfe; \ndenn  die  übrigen  Spinnenfüße  sind  nicht  bemerklich.  Wie \nauf  stelzenartigen  Armen  schreiten  sie  einher,  und  so- \nbald eine  Patelle  sich  unter  ihrem  Schild  vom  Flecke \nbewegt,  fahren  sie  zu,  um  die  Schere  in  den  schmalen \nRaum  zwischen  der  Schale  und  dem  Boden  zu  stecken, \ndas  Dach  umzukehren  und  die  Auster  zu  verschmausen. \nDie  Patelle  zieht  sachte  ihren  Weg  hin,  saugt  sich  aber \ngleich  fest  an  den  Stein,  sobald  sie  die  Nähe  des  Feindes \nmerkt.  Dieser  gebärdet  sich  nun  wunderlich  um  das \nDächelchen  herum,  gar  zierlich  und  alienhaft;  aber  ihm \nfehlt  die  Kraft,  den  mächtigen  Muskel  des  weichen  Tier- \nchens zu  überwältigen,  er  tut  auf  diese  Beute  Verzicht, \neilt  auf  eine  andere  wandernde  los,  und  die  erste  setzt \nihren  Zug  sachte  fort.  Ich  habe  nicht  gesehen,  daß  irgend \nein  Taschenkrebs  zu  seinem  Zweck  gelangt  wäre,  ob  ich \ngleich  den  Rückzug  dieses  Gewimmels  stundenlang,  wie \nsie  die  beiden  Flächen  und  die  dazwischen  liegenden \nStufen  hinabschlichen,  beobachtet  habe. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  99 \n\nDcti  10.  Oktober. \nNun  endlich  kann  ich  denn  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  eine  Ko- \nmödie gesehen  habe!  Sie  spielten  heut  auf  dem  Theater \nSt.  Lukas:  Le  Baruffe  Chiozzotte,  welches  allenfalls  zu \nübersetzen  wäre:  Die  Rauf-  und  Schreihändel  von  Chi- \nozza.  Die  Handelnden  sind  lauter  Seeleute,  Einwohner \nvon  Chiozza,  und  ihre  Weiber,  Schwestern  und  Töchter. \nDas  gewöhnliche  Geschrei  dieser  Leute,  im  Guten  und \nBösen,  ihre  Händel,  Heftigkeit,  Gutmütigkeit,  Plattheit, \nWitz,  Humor  und  ungezwungene  Manieren,  alles  ist  gar \nbrav  nachgeahmt.  Das  Stück  ist  noch  von  Goldoni,  und \nda  ich  erst  gestern  in  jener  Gegend  war  und  mir  Stim- \nmen und  Betragen  der  See-  und  Hafenleute  noch  im \nAug'  und  Ohr  widerschien  und  widerklang,  so  machte \nes  gar  große  Freude,  und  ob  ich  gleich  manchen  einzel- \nnen Bezug  nicht  verstand,  so  konnte  ich  doch  dem  Gan- \nzen recht  gut  folgen.  Der  Plan  des  Stücks  ist  folgender. \nDie  Einwohnerinnen  von  Chiozza  sitzen  auf  der  Reede \nvor  ihren  Häusern,  spinnen,  stricken,  nähen,  klippein, \nwie  gewöhnlich;  ein  junger  Mensch  geht  vorüber  und \ngrüßt  eine  freundlicher  als  die  übrigen;  sogleich  fängt \ndas  Sticheln  an;  dies  hält  nicht  Maße,  es  schärft  sich  und \nwächst  bis  zum  Hohne,  steigert  sich  zu  Vorwürfen,  eine \nUnart  überbietet  die  andere;  eine  heftige  Nachbarin  platzt \nmit  der  Wahrheit  heraus,  und  nun  ist  Schelten,  Schimp- \nfen, Schreien  auf  einmal  losgebunden,  es  fehlt  nicht  an \nentschiedenen  Beleidigungen,  so  daß  die  Gerichtspersonen \nsich  einzumischen  genötigt  sind. \n\nIm  zweiten  Akt  befindet  man  sich  in  der  Gerichtsstube. \nDer  Aktuarius  an  der  Stelle  des  abwesenden  Podesta,  der \nals  Nobile  nicht  auf  dem  Theater  hätte  erscheinen  dürfen, \nder  Aktuarius  also  läßt  die  Frauen  einzeln  vorfordern: \ndieses  wird  dadurch  bedenklich,  daß  er  selbst  in  die  erste \nLiebhaberin  verliebt  ist  und,  sehr  glücklich  sie  allein  zu \nsprechen,  anstatt  sie  zu  verhören  ihr  eine  Liebeserklärung \ntut.  Eine  andere,  die  in  den  Aktuarius  verliebt  ist,  stürzt \neifersüchtig  herein,  der  aufgeregte  Liebhaber  der  ersten \ngleichfalls,   die   übrigen   folgen,   neue   Vorwürfe  häufen \n\n\nloo  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich,  und  nun  ist  der  Teufel  in  der  Gerichtsstube  los,  wie \nvorher  auf  dem  Hafenplatz. \n\nIm  dritten  Akt  steigert  sich  der  Scherz,  und  das  Ganze \nendet  mit  einer  eiligen  notdürftigen  Auflösung.  Der  glück- \nlichste Gedanke  jedoch  ist  in  einem  Charakter  ausge- \ndrückt, der  sich  folgendermaßen  darstellt. \nEin  alter  Schiffer,  dessen  Gliedmaßen,  besonders  aber \ndie  Sprachorgane,  durch  eine  von  Jugend  auf  geführte \nharte  Lebensart  stockend  geworden,  tritt  auf,  als  Gegen- \nsatz des  beweglichen,  schwätzenden,  schreiseligen  Volkes; \ner  nimmt  immer  erst  einen  Anlauf  durch  Bewegung  der \nLippen  und  Nachhelfen  der  Hände  und  Arme,  bis  er \ndenn  endlich,  was  er  gedacht,  herausstößt.  Weil  ihm \ndieses  aber  nur  in  kurzen  Sätzen  gelingt,  so  hat  er  sich \neinen  lakonischen  Ernst  angewöhnt,  dergestalt,  daß  alles, \nwas  er  sagt,  sprüchwörtlich  oder  sentenzios  klingt,  wo- \ndurch denn  das  übrige  wilde,  leidenschaftliche  Handeln \ngar  schön  ins  Gleichgewicht  gesetzt  wird. \nAber  auch  so  eine  Lust  habe  ich  noch  nie  erlebt,  als  das \nVolk  laut  werden  ließ,  sich  und  die  Seinigen  so  natürlich \nvorstellen  zu  sehen.  Ein  Gelächter  und  Gejauchze  von \nAnfang  bis  zu  Ende.  Ich  muß  aber  auch  gestehen,  daß \ndie  Schauspieler  es  vortrefflich  machten.  Sie  hatten  sich, \nnach  Anlage  der  Charaktere,  in  die  verschiedenen  Stim- \nmen geteilt,  welche  unter  dem  Volk  gewöhnlich  vorkom- \nmen. Die  erste  Aktrice  war  allerliebst,  viel  besser  als  neu- \nlich in  Heldentracht  und  Leidenschaft.  Die  Frauen  über- \nhaupt, besonders  aber  diese,  ahmten  Stimme,  Gebärden \nund  Wesen  des  Volks  aufs  anmutigste  nach.  Großes  Lob \nverdient  der  Verfasser,  der  aus  nichts  den  angenehmsten \nZeitvertreib  gel)ildet  hat.  Das  kann  man  aber  auch  nur \nunmittelbar  seinem  eignen  lebenslustigen  Volk.  Es  ist \ndurchaus  mit  einer  geübten  Hand  geschrieben. \nVon  der  Truppe  Sacchi,  für  welche  Gozzi  arbeitete  und \ndie  übrigens  zerstreut  ist,  habe  ich  die  Smeraldina  ge- \nsehen, eine  kleine,  dicke  Figur,  voller  Leben,  Gewandt- \nheit und  guten  Humors.  Mit  ihr  sah  ich  den  }3righella, \neinen  hagem,  wohlgebauten,  besonders  in  Mienen-  und \nHändespiel  trefilichen  Schauspieler.    Diese  Masken,  die \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  loi \n\nwir  fast  nur  als  Mumien  kennen,  da  sie  für  uns  weder \nLeben  noch  Bedeutung  haben,  tun  hier  gar  zu  wohl,  als \nGeschöpfe  dieser  Landschaft.  Die  ausgezeichneten  Alter, \nCharaktere  und  Stände  haben  sich  in  wunderlichen  Klei- \ndern verkörpert,  und  wenn  man  selbst  den  größten  Teil \ndes  Jahrs  mit  der  Maske  herumläuft,  so  findet  man  nichts \nnatürlicher,  als  daß  da  droben  auch  schwarze  Gesichter \nerscheinen. \n\nDen  II.  Oktober. \n\nUnd  weil  die  Einsamkeit  in  einer  so  großen  Menschen- \nmasse denn  doch  zuletzt  nicht  recht  möglich  sein  will, \nso  bin  ich  mit  einem  alten  Franzosen  zusammengekom- \nmen, der  kein  Italienisch  kann,  sich  wie  verraten  und \nverkauft  fühlt  und,  mit  allen  Empfehlungsschreiben,  doch \nnicht  recht  weiß,  woran  er  ist.  Ein  Mann  von  Stande, \nsehr  guter  Lebensart,  der  aber  nicht  aus  sich  heraus  kann; \ner  mag  stark  in  den  Funfzigen  sein  und  hat  zu  Hause  einen \nsiebenjährigen  Knaben,  von  dem  er  bänglich  Nachrichten \nerwartet.  Ich  habe  ihm  einige  Gefälligkeiten  erzeigt;  er \nreist  durch  Italien  bequem,  aber  geschwind,  um  es  doch \neinmal  gesehen  zu  haben,  und  mag  sich  gern  im  Vorbei- \ngehen so  viel  wie  möglich  unterrichten;  ich  gebe  ihm \nAuskunft  über  manches.  Als  ich  mit  ihm  von  Venedig \nsprach,  fragte  er  mich,  wie  lange  ich  hier  sei,  und  als  er \nhörte,  nur  vierzehn  Tage  und  zum  erstenmal,  versetzte \ner:  II  parait  que  vous  n'avez  pas  perdu  votre  temps.  Das \nist  das  erste  Testimonium  meines  Wohlverhaltens,  das \nich  aufweisen  kann.  Er  ist  nun  acht  Tage  hier  und \ngeht  morgen  fort.  Es  war  mir  köstlich,  einen  recht  ein- \ngefleischten Versailler  in  der  Fremde  zu  sehen.  Der \nreist  nun  auch!  und  ich  betrachtete  mit  Erstaunen,  wie \nman  reisen  kann,  ohne  etwas  außer  sich  gewahr  zu  wer- \nden; und  er  ist  in  seiner  Art  ein  recht  gebildeter,  wackrer, \nordentlicher  Mann. \n\nDen  12.  Oktober. \nGestern  gaben  sie  zu  St.  Lukas  ein  neues  Stück:  LTngli- \ncismo  in  Italia.    Da  viele  Engländer  in  Italien  leben,  so \n\n\nI02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nist  es  natürlich,  daß  ihre  Sitten  bemerkt  werden,  und \nich  dachte  hier  zu  erfahren,  wie  die  ItaHener  diese  rei- \nchen und  ihnen  so  willkommenen  Gäste  betrachten;  aber \nes  war  ganz  und  gar  nichts.  Einige  glückliche  Narren- \nszenen, wie  immer,  das  übrige  aber  zu  schwer  und  ernst- \nlich gemeint,  und  denn  doch  keine  Spur  von  englischem \nSinn;  die  gewöhnlichen  italienischen  sittlichen  Gemein- \nsprüche, und  auch  nur  auf  das  Gemeinste  gerichtet. \nAuch  gefiel  es  nicht  und  war  auf  dem  Punkt,  ausgepfiffen \nzu  werden;  die  Schauspieler  fühlten  sich  nicht  in  ihrem \nElemente,  nicht  auf  dem  Platze  von  Chiozza.  Da  dies \ndas  letzte  Stück  ist,  was  ich  hier  sehe,  so  scheint  es,  mein \nEnthusiasmus  für  jene  Nationalrepräsentation  sollte  noch \ndurch  diese  Folie  erhöht  werden. \n\nNachdem  ich  zum  Schluß  mein  Tagebuch  durchgegangen, \nkleine  Schreibtafelbemerkungen  eingeschaltet,  so  sollen \ndie  Akten  inrotuliert  und  den  Freunden  zum  Urteils- \nspruch zugeschickt  werden.  Schon  jetzt  finde  ich  man- \nches in  diesen  Blättern,  das  ich  näher  bestimmen,  er- \nweitern und  verbessern  könnte;  es  mag  stehen  als  Denk- \nmal des  ersten  Eindrucks,  der,  wenn  er  auch  nicht  immer \nwahr  wäre,  uns  doch  köstlich  und  wert  bleibt.  Könnte \nich  nur  den  Freunden  einen  Hauch  dieser  leichtern  Exi- \nstenz hinübersenden!  Jawohl  ist  dem  Italiener  das  Ultra- \nmontane eine  dunkle  Vorstellung,  auch  mir  kommt  das \nJenseits  der  Alpen  nun  düster  vor;  doch  winken  freund- \nliche Gestalten  immer  aus  dem  Nebel.  Nur  das  Klima \nwürde  mich  reizen,  diese  Gegenden  jenen  vorzuziehen; \ndenn  Geburt  und  Gewohnheit  sind  mächtige  Fesseln.  Ich \nmöchte  hier  nicht  leben,  wie  überall  an  keinem  Orte,  wo  ich \nunbeschäftigt  wäre;  jetzt  macht  mir  das  Neue  unendlich \nviel  zu  Schäften.  Die  Baukunst  steigt  wie  ein  alter  Geist \naus  dem  Grabe  hervor,  sie  heißt  mich  ihre  Lehren,  wie \ndie  Regeln  einer  ausgestorbenen  Sprache,  studieren, \nnicht  um  sie  auszuüben  oder  mich  in  ihr  lebendig  zu \nerfreuen,  sondern  nur  um  die  ehrwürdige,  für  ewig  ab- \ngeschiedene Existenz  der  vergangenen  Zeitalter  in  einem \nstillen  Gemüte  zu  verehren.    Da  Palladio  alles  auf  Vitruv \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  103 \n\nbezieht,  so  habe  ich  mir  auch  die  Ausgabe  des  Galiani \nangeschaftt:  allein  dieser  Foliante  lastet  in  meinem  Ge- \npäck wie  das  Studium  desselben  auf  meinem  Gehirn. \nPalladio  hat  mir  durch  seine  Worte  und  Werke,  durch \nseine  Art  und  Weise  des  Denkens  und  Schaffens  den \nVitruv  schon  näher  gebracht  und  verdolmetscht,  besser \nals  die  italienische  Übersetzung  tun  kann.  Vitruv  liest \nsich  nicht  so  leicht;  das  Buch  ist  an  sich  schon  düster \ngeschrieben  und  fordert  ein  kritisches  Studium.  Dem- \nohngeachtet  lese  ich  es  flüchtig  durch,  und  es  bleibt  mir \nmancher  würdige  Eindruck.  Besser  zu  sagen:  ich  lese \nes  wie  ein  Brevier,  mehr  aus  Andacht  als  zur  Belehrung. \nSchon  bricht  die  Nacht  zeitiger  ein  und  gibt  Raum  zum \nLesen  imd  Schreiben. \n\nGott  sei  Dank,  wie  mir  alles  wieder  lieb  wird,  was  mir \nvon  Jugend  auf  wert  war!  Wie  glücklich  befinde  ich  mich, \ndaß  ich  den  alten  Schriftstellern  wieder  näher  zu  treten \nwage!  Denn  jetzt  darf  ich  es  sagen,  darf  meine  Krank- \nheit und  Torheit  bekennen.  Schon  einige  Jahre  her  dürft' \nich  keinen  lateinischen  Autor  ansehen,  nichts  betrachten, \nwas  mir  ein  Bild  Italiens  erneute.  Geschah  es  zufällig, \nso  erduldete  ich  die  entsetzlichsten  Schmerzen.  Herder \nspottete  oft  über  mich,  daß  ich  all  mein  Latein  aus  dem \nSpinoza  lerne;  denn  er  hatte  bemerkt,  daß  dies  das  einzige \nlateinische  Buch  war,  das  ich  las:  er  wußte  aber  nicht,  wie \nsehr  ich  mich  vor  den  Alten  hüten  mußte,  wie  ich  mich  in \njene  abstrusen  Allgemeinheiten  nur  ängstlich  flüchtete. \nNoch  zuletzt  hat  mich  die  Wielandsche  Übersetzung  der \nSatiren  höchst  unglücklich  gemacht:  ich  hatte  kaum  zwei \ngelesen,  so  war  ich  schon  verrückt. \nHätte  ich  nicht  den  Entschluß  gefaßt,  den  ich  jetzt  aus- \nführe, so  war'  ich  rein  zugrunde  gegangen:  zu  einer  sol- \nchen Reife  war  die  Begierde,  diese  Gegenstände  mit \nAugen  zu  sehen,  in  meinem  Gemüt  gestiegen.  Die  histo- \nrische Kenntnis  fördert  mich  nicht:  die  Dinge  standen \nnur  eine  Handbreit  von  mir  ab,  aber  durch  eine  undurch- \ndringliche Mauer  geschieden.  Es  ist  mir  wirklich  auch \njetzt  nicht  etwa  zumute,  als  wenn  ich  die  Sachen  zum \nerstenmal  sähe,  sondern  als  ob  ich  sie  wiedersähe.    Ich \n\n\nI04  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nbin  nur  kurze  Zeit  in  Venedig  und  habe  mir  die  hiesige \nExistenz  genugsam  zugeeignet  und  weiß,  daß  ich,  wenn \nauch  einen  unvollständigen,  doch  einen  ganz  klaren  und \nwahren  Begrifi\"  mit  wegnehme. \n\nVenedig,  den  14.  Oktober,  2  Stundeti  in  der  Nacht. \nIn  den  letzten  Augenblicken  meines  Hierseins:  denn  es \ngeht  sogleich  mit  dem  Kurierschifte  nach  Ferrara.  Ich \nverlasse  Venedig  gern;  denn  um  mit  Vergnügen  und \nNutzen  zu  bleiben,  müßte  ich  andere  Schritte  tun,  die \naußer  meinem  Plan  liegen;  auch  verläßt  jedermann  nun \ndiese  Stadt  und  sucht  seine  Garten  und  Besitzungen \nauf  dem  festen  Lande.  Ich  habe  indes  gut  aufgeladen \nund  trage  das  reiche,  sonderbare,  einzige  Bild  mit  mir \nfort. \n\n\n--- [ID: e903f4eb-27d0-4022-9799-beb412688474] GOETHES_Excerpt ---\n[HOW TO USE]: Here is the excerpt text that must be augmented\nDen 3. Oktober. Die Kirche Il Redentore, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will. Er war unzufrieden, wie ich aus gelinder Wendung seines Buches schließe, daß man bei christlichen Kirchen nach der Form der alten Basiliken zu bauen fortfahre, er suchte deshalb seine heiligen Gebäude der alten Tempelform zu nähern; daher entstanden gewisse Unschicklichkeiten, die mir bei Il Redentore glücklich beseitigt, bei St. Giorgio aber zu auffallend erscheinen. Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf. Inwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren.   Den 3. Oktober. Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen. Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.   Den 3. Oktober. Den Plan in der Hand suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld. Es wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 pages story in english that enhance the event :[GOETHES_Excerpt], keep everything already present and build around it.

      "content": "The third of October dawned with a brisk, blustery sirocco, whipping the Giudecca Canal into a froth of restless waves. My gondola, hired for the day's architectural pilgrimage, bobbed and swayed, forcing a constant adjustment of my gaze. It was a peculiar dance, this attempt to absorb the static perfection of Palladio's vision while my very platform for observation proved so volatile. The white marble, or what appeared to be such, of Il Redentore shimmered and fractured in the agitated reflections, its precise geometric lines rendered fluid and unstable by the water's dance.\n\n\"**The Church of Il Redentore, a beautiful, grand work by Palladio, its façade more laudable than that of San Giorgio.**\" I murmured, pulling Volkmann's guide from my satchel, though I knew it would fall short. Volkmann, with his meticulous measurements and conventional praise, would describe the seventeen steps leading to the portico, the Roman temple aspect, but he would miss the internal struggle, the ingenious resolution that Palladio had achieved here. The problem, as I had come to understand through his *Quattro Libri*, was fundamental: how to impose the rigid, single-pedimented form of an antique Roman temple onto the complex, multi-tiered structure of a Christian basilica, with its high central nave and lower side aisles.\n\n\"**These works, engraved multiple times in copper, one would need to see before oneself to clarify what has been said. Here, only a few words.**\" I mused, looking up from my thoughts to the church, now closer. Palladio, a man utterly steeped in the ancient world, must have felt the constraints of his own age keenly. He sought to elevate Christian architecture, to imbue it with the noble forms of antiquity, but without sacrificing its functional requirements. At Il Redentore, he had masterfully layered two temple fronts, one higher and narrower for the nave, the other wider and lower for the aisles, creating an illusion of interlocking forms that achieved a rare harmony. The central pediment, supported by stately semi-columns, rose majestically, while a secondary, broader pediment seemed to recede behind it, perfectly integrating the lower parts of the church. An attic wall, reminiscent of the Pantheon, completed the composition, drawing the eye upwards to a serene, resolved whole.\n\nThis was in stark contrast to San Giorgio Maggiore, visible across the basin, where the central columns of the major order rested on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters began from the ground. It created a visual rupture, an impression that the central part was \"on stilts,\" as if disconnected from its foundations. It was, as I had noted, \"**certain unseemlinesses, which at Il Redentore appear happily avoided, but at San Giorgio too conspicuous.**\" Volkmann, for all his detail, \"**says something about it, but doesn't hit the nail on the head.**\" He saw the forms but missed the theoretical tension, the architectural dialogue Palladio engaged in.\n\nAs the gondola drew closer to the Giudecca, I noticed something else, a detail that stripped away the illusion of marble grandeur. The pristine white façade, so serene and classical from a distance, began to reveal its true nature under the sharp autumn light. \"**Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is… of burnt clay.**\" The smooth, uniform surface, which I had taken for solid stone, was in fact stucco over brick. Even the frieze and cornice, which appeared so finely carved, were of terracotta. It was a \"pretty deception,\" an artifice that spoke of Venice's economic realities, a city past its prime, no longer able to afford the noble stone of antiquity, yet still able to conjure its spirit through ingenuity and proportion. This realization lent the building an unexpected fragility, a poignant beauty. The genius lay not in the material, but in the vision that transcended it.\n\nStepping onto the quayside, the salty air mingled with a faint, sweet smell of incense. It was the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi, the *Transitus*, a day of solemn preparation for the Capuchin Friars Minor who maintained Il Redentore. The church, usually a sanctuary of Palladian purity, was now abuzz with a different kind of activity, a vibrant, almost chaotic devotion.\n\n\"**Inside, Il Redentore is likewise exquisite, everything, even the design of the altars, by Palladio; unfortunately, the niches, which should have been filled with statues, are adorned with flat, cut-out, painted board figures.**\" The transition from the rational grandeur of the exterior to the fervent, almost folksy, piety within was jarring. The Capuchins, an order dedicated to poverty, had taken Palladio’s noble spaces and filled them with an *arte povera* that spoke of heartfelt devotion rather than classical taste.\n\nI made my way to a side altar, where the preparations for St. Francis’s feast were in full swing. \"**In honour of Saint Francis, the Capuchin Fathers had powerfully decorated a side altar; one saw nothing of stone but the Corinthian capitals; everything else seemed covered with a tasteful, splendid embroidery in the style of arabesques, and indeed so prettily, as one could only wish to see. I particularly wondered at the broad, gold-embroidered tendrils and foliage.**\" My initial impression was one of opulent, if somewhat provincial, splendor. The altar gleamed with what appeared to be intricate goldwork, rich patterns of leaves and vines swirling around the sacred images.\n\nBut as I drew nearer, the illusion began to unravel. \"**I went closer and found a rather charming deception. Everything I had taken for gold was flattened straw, glued onto paper according to beautiful designs, the background painted with lively colours, and that so varied and tasteful that this amusement, whose material was worth nothing at all, and which was probably executed in the monastery itself, would have cost several thousand thalers had it been genuine. One could well imitate it on occasion.**\" The \"gold\" was dyed straw marquetry, painstakingly cut and arranged, mimicking precious metals and fabrics. The \"embroidery\" was not silk or gold thread, but vibrant paints on cardboard figures, cut out and arranged in niches intended for noble marble statues. It was a clash of aesthetics: Palladio's grand design, meant for enduring stone and classical forms, now housed the ephemeral, humble artistry of the Capuchins. There was a touching ingenuity in it, a testament to devotion making do with meager resources, yet my neoclassical eye couldn't help but register the \"bad taste,\" the visual discord. The air here, mingling with the incense, carried faint scents of cypress and herbs from the vast convent garden behind the church, a reminder of the friars' self-sufficiency and their rootedness in the island's natural life, a stark contrast to the illusionary gold before me.\n\nLeaving the church, the vibrant chaos of the Venetian streets was a welcome, if noisy, change. My path, guided by the map in my hand, led me through a labyrinth of narrow *calli* and over countless small bridges, each with its own flight of steps. The city was a sensory overload: the incessant chatter, the cries of street vendors, the clatter of shoes on paving stones. I made my way towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a bustling quay that stretched along the St. Mark's Basin, a true artery of the city's life. Here, the air was thick with the smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish from the *frittole* stalls, and the faint, tarry scent of caulking from the ships. The crowd was a cosmopolitan mix: Venetian citizens, merchants from Dalmatia and Greece, sailors with their distinctive red caps and long pipes, all speaking a melange of languages, dominated by the musical, clipped sounds of the Venetian dialect.\n\n\"**On a quayside, overlooking the water, I had already noticed several times a small fellow who, to a larger or smaller number of listeners, told stories in Venetian dialect; unfortunately, I can understand nothing of it, but no one laughs, only rarely does the audience, which mostly consists of the lowest class, smile. Nor does the man have anything striking or ridiculous in his manner, but rather something very composed, yet at the same time an admirable variety and precision in his gestures, which pointed to art and reflection.**\" This street storyteller, an *improvisatore*, was a direct link to the Commedia dell'arte tradition, a Goldonian character come to life. He stood on an upturned crate, his slight frame commanding attention not through bombast, but through a measured, almost scholarly cadence, punctuated by broad, expressive gestures. He was not a man of letters, but a repository of oral history, recounting \"old legends\"—perhaps tales of Doges and naval victories, or maybe the delivery from the plague that Il Redentore commemorated, embellished with popular miracles. The crowd, though of the \"lowest class,\" listened with an absorbed, almost reverent attention, their faces occasionally breaking into a rare, knowing smile rather than outright laughter. It was a different kind of performance than the theatre, raw and immediate, yet clearly honed by years of practice. It was the \"felt history\" of Venice, transmitted directly, emotionally, in the vernacular of the streets.\n\nFollowing my plan, I navigated \"**through the most wondrous labyrinths to find my way to the Church of the Mendicanti.**\" This *Ospedale dei Mendicanti*, one of Venice’s renowned charitable institutions for orphaned girls, had become famous across Europe for its musical conservatory. As I entered the church, San Lazzaro, the bustling street sounds faded, replaced by a profound, expectant hush. The church was filled with listeners, their faces turned towards the high gallery, obscured by an ornate metal grille.\n\n\"**Here is the conservatory which currently enjoys the most acclaim. The women performed an oratorio behind the grille; the church was full of listeners, the music very beautiful, and splendid voices. An alto sang King Saul, the main character of the poem. I had no conception of such a voice; some passages of the music were infinitely beautiful, the text perfectly singable, so Italian Latin that one must laugh in places; but music finds a wide field here.**\" The music, Ferdinando Bertoni’s oratorio \"Saul,\" descended from behind the grille, disembodied and ethereal. The voices were indeed magnificent, soaring and intertwining with breathtaking virtuosity. But it was the alto, embodying the tragic fury of the biblical King Saul, that truly captivated me. It was a female voice, a rich, dark contralto, delivering the powerful, masculine role with an intensity that defied expectation. This vocal inversion, a characteristic of Venetian *ospedali*, was a phenomenon I had read about but never truly experienced. The \"Italian Latin,\" with its softened consonants and open vowels, did indeed provoke a smile, a peculiar fusion of sacred text and operatic sensibility.\n\nThe experience, however, was not without its flaws. \"**It would have been an excellent enjoyment, had not the cursed Kapellmeister beaten time with a roll of sheet music against the grille and so shamelessly clapped, as if he were dealing with schoolboys he was just teaching; and the girls had repeated the piece often, his clapping was quite unnecessary and destroyed all impression, no differently than if someone, to make us understand a beautiful statue, stuck scarlet patches on its joints. The foreign sound cancels all harmony.**\" The rhythmic *clack-clack-clack* of paper against iron, harsh and mechanical, was an unwelcome intrusion, a constant reminder of the rigid discipline behind the angelic voices. It was an impudent noise, an unnecessary assertion of control that shattered the delicate illusion of divine music. \"**That is now a musician, and he does not hear it, or rather he wishes that his presence should be perceived through an unseemliness, when it would be better if his worth were guessed from the perfection of the performance. I know the French have this manner; I would not have expected it of the Italians, and the public seems accustomed to it. It is not the only time that it allows itself to imagine that precisely what spoils enjoyment belongs to enjoyment.**\" It struck me as another instance of Venice's performative nature, where the mask of perfection was often marred by an underlying, almost defiant, crudity. The audience, seemingly oblivious, or perhaps just resigned, only highlighted the peculiar cultural gap I felt between the ideal and the reality of this enchanting, yet often perplexing, city.",

Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

September  1786. \n\nDAS  Amphitheater  ist  also  das  erste  bedeutende  Monu- \nment der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  sehe,  tmd  so  gut  erhalten! \nAls  ich  hinein  trat,  mehr  noch  aber,  als  ich  oben  auf  dem \nRande  umher  ging,  schien  es  mir  seltsam,  etwas  Großes \nund  doch  eigentlich  nichts  zu  sehen.  Auch  will  es  leer \nnicht  gesehen  sein,  sondern  ganz  voll  von  Menschen,  wie \nman  es  neuerer  Zeit  Joseph  dem  Zweiten  und  Pius  dem \nSechsten  zu  Ehren  veranstaltet.  Der  Kaiser,  der  doch \nauch  Menschenmassen  vor  Augen  gewohnt  war,  soll  dar- \nüber erstaunt  sein.  Doch  nur  in  der  frühesten  Zeit  tat \nes  seine  ganze  Wirkung,  da  das  Volk  noch  mehr  Volk \nwar,  als  es  jetzt  ist.  Denn  eigentlich  ist  so  ein  Amphi- \ntheater recht  gemacht,  dem  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zu  impo- \nnieren, das  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zum  besten  zu  haben. \nWenn  irgend  etwas  Schauwürdiges  auf  flacher  Erde  vor- \ngeht und  alles  zuläuft,  suchen  die  Hintersten  auf  alle \nmögliche  Weise  sich  über  die  Vordersten  zu  erheben:  man \ntritt  auf  Bänke,  rollt  Fässer  herbei,  fährt  mit  Wagen \nheran,  legt  Bretter  hinüber  und  herüber,  besetzt  einen \nbenachbarten  Hügel,  und  es  bildet  sich  in  der  Geschwin- \ndigkeit ein  Krater. \n\nKommt  das  Schauspiel  öfter  auf  derselben  Stelle  vor,  so \nbaut  man  leichte  Gerüste  für  die,  so  bezahlen  können, \nund  die  übrige  Masse  behilft  sich,  wie  sie  mag.  Dieses \nallgemeine  Bedürfnis  zu  befriedigen,  ist  hier  die  Aufgabe \ndes  Architekten.  Er  bereitet  einen  solchen  Krater  durch \nKunst,  so  einfach  als  nur  möglich,  damit  dessen  Zierat \ndas  Volk  selbst  werde.  Wenn  es  sich  so  beisammen  sah, \nmußte  es  über  sich  selbst  erstaunen;  denn  da  es  sonst \nnur  gewohnt,  sich  durcheinander  laufen  zu  sehen,  sich  in \neinem  Gewühle  ohne  Ordnung  und  sonderliche  Zucht  zu \nfinden,  so  sieht  das  vielköpfige,  vielsinnige,  schwankende, \nhin  und  her  irrende  Tier  sich  zu  einem  edlen  Körper \nvereinigt,  zu  einer  Einheit  bestimmt,  in  eine  Masse \nverbunden  und  befestigt,  als  eine  Gestalt,  von  eijiem \nGeiste  belebt.    Die  Simplizität  des  Oval  ist  jedem  Auge \n\n\n44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  die  angenehmste  Weise  fühlbar,  und  jeder  Kopf  dient \nzum  Maße,  wie  ungeheuer  das  Ganze  sei.  Jetzt,  wenn \nman  es  leer  sieht,  hat  man  keinen  Maßstab,  man  weiß \nnicht,  ob  es  groß  oder  klein  ist. \n\nWegen  der  Unterhaltung  dieses  Werks  müssen  die  Vero- \nneser  gelobt  werden.  Es  ist  von  einem  rötlichen  Marmor \ngebaut,  den  die  Witterung  angreift;  daher  stellt  man  der \nReihe  nach  die  ausgefressenen  Stufen  immer  wieder  her, \nund  sie  scheinen  fast  alle  ganz  neu.  Eine  Inschrift  ge- \ndenkt eines  Hieronymus  Maurigenus  und  seines  auf  dieses \nMonument  verwendeten  unglaublichen  Fleißes.  Von  der \näußern  Mauer  steht  nur  ein  Stück,  und  ich  zweifele,  ob \nsie  je  ganz  fertig  geworden.  Die  untern  Gewölbe,  die  an \nden  großen  Platz,  II  Brä  genannt,  stoßen,  sind  an  Hand- \nwerker vermietet,  und  es  sieht  lustig  genug  aus,  diese \nHöhlungen  wieder  belebt  zu  sehen. \n\nDas  schönste,  aber  immer  geschlossene  Tor  heißt  Porta \nstuppa  oder  del  Pallio.  Als  Tor  und  in  der  großen  Ent- \nfernung, aus  der  man  es  schon  gewahr  wird,  ist  es  nicht \ngut  gedacht;  denn  erst  in  der  Nähe  erkennt  man  das \nVerdienst  des  Gebäudes. \n\nSie  geben  allerlei  Ursachen  an,  warum  es  geschlossen \nsei.  Ich  habe  jedoch  eine  Mutmaßung.  Die  Absicht  des \nKünstlers  ging  offenbar  dahin,  durch  dieses  Tor  eine  neue \nAnlage  des  Korso  zu  verursachen;  denn  auf  die  jetzige \nStraße  steht  es  ganz  falsch.  Die  linke  Seite  hat  lauter \nBaracken,  und  die  winkelrechte  Linie  der  Mitte  des  Tores \ngeht  auf  ein  Nonnenkloster  zu,  das  notwendig  hätte \nniedergelegt  werden  müssen.  Das  sah  man  wohl  ein,  auch \nmochten  die  Vornehmen  und  Reichen  nicht  Lust  haben, \nsich  in  dem  entfernten  Quartier  anzubauen.  Der  Künstler \nstarb  vielleicht,  und  so  schloß  man  das  Tor,  wodurch  die \nSache  nun  auf  einmal  geendigt  war. \n\nDas  Portal  des  Theatergebäudes,  von  sechs  großen  ioni- \nschen Säulen,  nimmt  sich  anständig  genug  aus.  Desto \nkleinlicher  erscheint  über  der  Türe,  vor  einer  gemalten \nNische,  die  von  zwei  korintliischen  Säulen  getragen  wird \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  45 \n\ndie  lebensgroße  Büste  des  Marchese  Maffei  in  einer \ngroßen  Perücke.  Der  Platz  ist  ehrenvoll,  aber  um  sich \ngegen  die  Größe  und  Tüchtigkeit  der  Säulen  einiger- \nmaßen zu  halten,  hätte  die  Büste  kolossal  sein  müssen. \nJetzt  steht  sie  kleinlich  auf  einem  Kragsteinchen,  unhar- \nmonisch mit  dem  Ganzen. \n\nAuch  die  Galerie,  die  den  Vorhof  einfaßt,  ist  kleinlich, \nund  die  kannelierten  dorischen  Zwerge  nehmen  sich  neben \nden  glatten  ionischen  Riesen  armselig  aus.  Doch  wollen \nwir  das  verzeihen  in  Betracht  der  schönen  Anstalt,  welche \nunter  diesen  Säulenlauben  angelegt  ist.  Hier  hat  man \ndie  Antiquitäten,  meist  in  und  um  Verona  gegraben,  ge- \nsammelt aufgestellt.  Einiges  soll  sogar  sich  im  Amphi- \ntheater gefunden  haben.  Es  sind  etrurische,  griechische, \nrömische,  bis  zu  den  niedern  Zeiten  und  auch  neuere. \nDie  Basreliefs  sind  in  die  Wände  eingemauert  und  mit \nden  Nummern  versehen,  die  ihnen  Maffei  gab,  als  er  sie \nin  seinem  Werke  Verona  illustrata  beschrieb.  Altäre, \nStücke  von  Säulen  und  dergleichen  Reste.  Ein  ganz  treff- \nlicher Dreifuß  von  weißem  Marmor,  worauf  Genien,  die \nsich  mit  den  Attributen  der  Götter  beschäftigen.  Raffael \nhat  dergleichen  in  den  Zwickeln  der  Farnesine  nachge- \nahmt und  verklärt. \n\nDer  Wind,  der  von  den  Gräbern  der  Alten  herweht, \nkommt  mit  Wohlgerüchen  wie  über  einen  Rosenhügel. \nDie  Grabmäler  sind  herzlich  und  rührend  und  stellen \nimmer  das  Leben  her.  Da  ist  ein  Mann,  der  neben  seiner \nFrau  aus  einer  Nische  wie  zu  einem  Fenster  heraussieht. \nDa  stehen  Vater  und  Mutter,  den  Sohn  in  der  Mitte,  ein- \nander mit  unaussprechlicher  Natürlichkeit  anblickend. \nHier  reicht  sich  ein  Paar  die  Hände.  Hier  scheint  ein \nVater,  auf  seinem  Sofa  ruhend,  von  der  Familie  unter- \nhalten zu  werden.  Mir  war  die  unmittelbare  Gegenwart \ndieser  Steine  höchst  rührend.  Von  späterer  Kunst  sind \nsie,  aber  einfach,  natürlich  und  allgemein  ansprechend. \nHier  ist  kein  geharnischter  Mann  auf  den  Knien,  der \neine  fröhliche  Auferstehung  erwartet.  Der  Künstler  hat \nmit  mehr  oder  weniger  Geschick  nur  die  einfache  Gegen- \nwart  der   Menschen  hingestellt,   ihre  Existenz  dadurch \n\n\n46  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfortgesetzt  und  bleibend  gemacht.  Sie  falten  nicht  die \nHände,  schauen  nicht  gen  Himmel,  sondern  sie  sind  hie- \nnieden,  was  sie  waren  und  was  sie  sind.  Sie  stehen  bei- \nsammen, nehmen  Anteil  aneinander,  lieben  sich;  und  das \nist  in  den  Steinen,  sogar  mit  einer  gewissen  Handwerks- \nunfähigkeit, allerliebst  ausgedrückt.  Ein  sehr  reich  ver- \nzierter marmorner  Pfeiler  gab  mir  auch  neue  Begriffe. \nSo  löblich  diese  Anstalt  ist,  so  sieht  man  ihr  doch  an, \ndaß  der  edle  Erhaltungsgeist,  der  sie  gegründet,  nicht \nmehr  in  ihr  fortlebt.  Der  kostbare  Dreifuß  geht  nächstens \nzugrunde,  weil  er  frei  steht,  gegen  Westen  der  Witterung \nausgesetzt.  Mit  einem  hölzernen  Futteral  wäre  dieser \nSchatz  leicht  zu  erhalten. \n\nDer  angefangene  Palast  des  Proveditore,  wäre  er  fertig \ngeworden,  hätte  ein  schön  Stück  Baukunst  gegeben.  Sonst \nbauen  die  Nobili  noch  viel,  leider  aber  ein  jeder  auf  den \nPlatz,  wo  seine  ältere  Wohnung  stand,  also  oft  in  engen \nGassen.  So  baut  man  jetzt  eine  prächtige  Fassade  eines \nSeminariums  in  einem  Gäßchen  der  entferntesten  Vor- \nstadt. \n\nAls  ich  mit  meinem  zufällig  aufgegriffenen  Begleiter  vor \neinem  großen  ernsthaften  Tore  eines  wunderbaren  Ge- \nbäudes vorüberging,  fragte  er  mich  gutmütig,  ob  ich  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  in  den  Hof  treten  wolle.  Es  war  der \nPalast  der  Justiz,  und  wegen  Höhe  der  Gebäude  erschien \nder  Hof  doch  nur  als  ein  ungeheurer  Brunnen.  Hier \nwerden,  sagte  er,  alle  die  Verbrecher  und  Verdächtigen \nverwahrt.  Ich  sah  umher,  und  durch  alle  Stockwerke \ngingen,  an  zahlreichen  Türen  hin,  offene  mit  eisernen \nGeländern  versehene  Gänge.  Der  Gefangene,  wie  er  aus \nseinem  Kerker  heraustrat,  um  zum  Verhör  geführt  zu \nwerden,  stand  in  der  freien  Tuft,  war  aber  auch  den \nBlicken  aller  ausgesetzt;  und  weil  nun  mehrere  Verhör- \nstuben sein  mochten,  so  klapperten  die  Ketten  bald  über \ndiesem,  bald  über  jenem  Gange  durch  alle  Stockwerke. \nEs  war  ein  verwünschter  Anblick,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \ndaß  der  gute  Humor,  womit  ich  meine  Vögel  abgefertigt \nhatte,  hier  doch  einen  etwas  schweren  Stand  würde  ge- \nfunden haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  47 \n\nIch  ging  auf  der  Kante  des  amphitheatralischen  Kraters \nbei  Sonnenuntergang,  der  schönsten  Aussicht  genießend \nüber  Stadt  und  Gegend.  Ich  war  ganz  allein,  und  unten \nauf  den  breiten  Steinen  des  Brä  gingen  Mengen  von \nMenschen,  Männer  von  allen  Ständen,  Weiber  vomMittel- \nstande  spazieren.  Diese  letztern  nehmen  sich  in  ihren \nschwarzen  Überkleidern,  aus  dieser  Vogelperspektive,  gar \nmumienhaft  aus. \n\nDer  Zendale  und  die  Veste,  die  dieser  Klasse  statt  aller \nGarderobe  dient,  ist  übrigens  eine  Tracht,  ganz  einge- \nrichtet für  ein  Volk,  das  nicht  immer  für  Reinlichkeit \nsorgen  und  doch  immer  ööentlich  erscheinen,  bald  in  der \nKirche,  bald  auf  dem  Spaziergange  sein  will.  Veste  ist \nein  schwarztaffeter  Rock,  der  über  andere  Röcke  gewor- \nfen wird.  Hat  das  Frauenzimmer  einen  reinlichen  weißen \ndarunter,  so  versteht  sie  den  schwarzen  an  der  einen  Seite \nin  die  Höhe  zu  heben.  Dieser  wird  so  angegürtet,  daß \ner  die  Taille  abschneidet  und  die  Lippen  des  Korsetts \nbedeckt,  welches  von  jeglicher  Farbe  sein  kann.  Der \nZendale  ist  eine  große  Kappe,  mit  langen  Barten,  die \nKappe  selbst  durch  ein  Drahtgestell  hoch  über  den  Kopf \ngehalten,  die  Barte  aber  wie  eine  Schärpe  um  den  Leib \ngeknüpft,  so  daß  die  Enden  hinterwärts  herunterfallen. \n\nAls  ich  heute  wieder  von  der  Arena  wegging,  kam  ich \neinige  tausend  Schritte  davon  zu  einem  modernen  ößent- \nlichen  Schauspiel.  Vier  edle  Veroneser  schlugen  Ball \ngegen  vier  Vicentiner.  Sie  treiben  dies  sonst  unter  sich \ndas  ganze  Jahr,  etwa  zwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht;  diesmal, \nwegen  der  fremden  Gegner,  lief  das  Volk  unglaublich  zu. \nEs  können  immer  vier-  bis  fünftausend  Zuschauer  ge- \nwesen sein.  Frauen  sah  ich  von  keinem  Stande. \nVorhin,  als  ich  vom  Bedürfnis  der  Menge  in  einem  sol- \nchen Falle  sprach,  hab'  ich  das  natürliche  zufällige  Am- \nphitaeater  schon  beschrieben,  wie  ich  das  Volk  hier  über- \neinander gebaut  sah.  Ein  lebhaftes  Händeklatschen  hört' \nich  schon  von  weiten,  jeder  bedeutende  Schlag  war  da- \nvon begleitet.  Das  Spiel  aber  geht  so  vor  sich:  In  ge- \nhöriger Entfernung  voneinander   sind   zwei   gelind  ab- \n\n\n4  3  ITA  1  JENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nliängige  Bretterflächen  errichtet.  Derjenige,  der  den  Ball \nausschlägt,  steht,  die  Rechte  mit  einem  hölzernen  breiten \nStachelringe  bewaffnet,  auf  der  obersten  Höhe.  Ir^dem \nnun  ein  anderer  von  seiner  Partei  ihm  den  r>all  zuwirft, \nso  läuft  er  herunter  dem  Ball  entgegen  und  vermehrt  da- \ndurch die  Gewalt  des  Schlages,  womit  er  denselben  zu \ntreffen  weiß.  Die  Gegner  suchen  ihn  zurückzuschlagen, \nund  so  geht  es  hin  und  wieder,  bis  er  zuletzt  im  Felde \nliegen  bleibt.  Die  schönsten  Stellungen,  wert,  in  Marmor \nnachgebildet  zu  werden,  kommen  dabei  zum  Vorschein. \nDa  es  lauter  wohlgewachsene,  rüstige,  junge  Leute  sind, \nin  kurzer,  knapper,  weißer  Kleidung,  so  unterscheiden \nsich  die  Parteien  nur  durch  ein  farbiges  Abzeichen.  Be- \nsonders schön  ist  die  Stellung,  in  welche  der  Ausschlagende \ngerät,  indem  er  von  der  schiefen  Fläche  herunter  läuft \nund  den  Ball  zu  treffen  ausholt;  sie  nähert  sich  der  des \nBorghesischen  Fechters. \n\nSonderbar  kam  es  mir  vor,  daß  sie  diese  Übung  an  einer \nnlten  Stadtmauer,  ohne  die  mindeste  Bequemlichkeit  für \ndie  Zuschauer,  vornehmen;  warum  sie  es  nicht  im  Amphi- \ntheater tun,  wo  so  schöner  Raum  wäre! \n\nDen  //.  September. \nWas  ich  von  Gemälden  gesehen,  will  ich  nur  kurz  be- \nrühren und  einige  Betrachtungen  hinzufügen.  Ich  mache \ndiese  wunderbare  Reise  nicht,  um  micli  selbst  zu  be- \ntrügen, sondern  um  mich  an  den  Gegenständen  kennen \nzu  lernen;  da  sage  ich  mir  denn  ganz  aufrichtig,  daß  ich \nvon  der  Kunst,  von  dem  Handwerk  des  Malers  wenig \nverstehe.  Meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  meine  Betrachtung \nkann  nur  auf  den  jiraktischen  Teil,  auf  den  Gegenstand \nund  auf  die  Behandlung  desselben  im  allgemeinen  ge- \nrichtet sein. \n\nSan  Giorgio  ist  eine  Galerie  von  guten  Gemälden,  alle \nAltarblätter,  wo  nicht  von  gleichem  Wert,  doch  duich- \naus  merkwürdig.  Aber  die  unglückseigen  Künstler,  was \nmußten  die  malen!  und  für  wen!  Ein  Mannaregen,  viel- \nleicht dreißig  Fuß  lang  und  zwanzig  hoch!  das  Wunder \nder  fünf  Brote  zum  Gegenstück!  was  war  daran  zu  malen: \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  49 \n\nHungrige  Menschen,  die  über  kleine  Körner  herfallen, \nunzählige  andere,  denen  Brot  präsentiert  wird.  Die \nKünstler  haben  sich  die  Folter  gegeben,  um  solche  Arm- \nseligkeiten bedeutend  zu  machen.  Und  doch  hat,  durch \ndiese  Nötigung  gereizt,  das  Genie  schöne  Sachen  hervor- \ngebracht. Ein  Künstler,  der  die  heilige  Ursula  mit  den \neilftausend  Jungfrauen  vorzustellen  hatte,  zog  sich  mit \ngroßem  Verstand  aus  der  Sache.  Die  Heilige  steht  im \nVordergrunde,  als  habe  sie  siegend  das  Land  in  Besitz \ngenommen;  sie  ist  sehr  edel,  amazonenhaft-jungfräulich, \nohne  Reiz  gebildet;  in  der  alles  verkleinernden  Ferne \nhingegen  sieht  man  ihre  Schar  aus  den  Schiften  steigen \nund  ia  Prozession  herankommen.  Die  Himmelfahrt  Maria \nim  Dom,  von  Tizian,  ist  sehr  verschwärzt,  der  Gedanke \nlobenswert,  daß  die  angehende  Göttin  nicht  himmel- \nwärts, sondern  herab  nach  ihren  Freunden  blickt. \nIn  der  Galerie  Gherardini  fand  ich  sehr  schöne  Sachen \nvon  Orbetto  und  lernte  diesen  verdienten  Künstler  auf \neinmal  kennen.  In  der  Entfernung  erfährt  man  nur  von \nden  ersten  Künstlern,  und  oft  begnügt  man  sich  mit  ihren \nNamen;  wenn  man  aber  diesem  Sternenhimmel  näher \ntritt  und  die  von  der  zweiten  und  dritten  Größe  nun  auch \nzu  flimmern  anfangen  und  jeder  auch  als  zum  ganzen \nSternbild  gehörend  hervortritt,  dann  wird  die  Welt  weit \nund  die  Kunst  reich.  Den  Gedanken  eines  Bildes  muß \nich  hier  loben.  Nur  zwei  Halbfiguren.  Simson  ist  eben \nim  Schöße  der  Delila  eingeschlafen,  sie  greift  leise  über \nihn  hinweg  nach  einer  Schere,  die  auf  dem  Tisch  neben \nder  Lampe  liegt.  Die  Ausfülirung  ist  sehr  brav.  Im \nPalast  Canossa  war  mir  eine  Danae  bemerklich. \nDer  Palast  Bevilacqua  enthält  die  köstlichsten  Sachen. \nEin  sogenanntes  Paradies  von  Tintorett,  eigentlich  aber \ndie  Krönung  der  Maria  zur  Himmelskönigin  in  Gegen- \nwart aller  Erzväter,  Propheten,  Apostel,  Heiligen,  Engel \nusw.,  eine  Gelegenheit,  den  ganzen  Reichtum  des  glück- \nlichsten Genies  zu  entwickeln.  Leichtigkeit  des  Pinsels, \nGeist,  Mannigfaltigkeit  des  Ausdrucks,  dies  alles  zu  be- \nwundern und  sich  dessen  zu  erfreuen,  müßte  man  das \nStück  selbst  besitzen  und  es  zeitlebens  vor  Augen  haben. \n\nGOETHE  IV  4 \n\n\n50  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  Arbeit  geht  ins  Unendliche,  ja  die  letzten  in  der \nGlorie  verschwindenden  Engelsköpfe  haben  noch  Cha- \nrakter. Die  größten  Figuren  mögen  einen  Fuß  hoch  sein, \nMaria  und  Christus,  der  ihr  die  Krone  aufsetzt,  etwa \nvier  Zoll.  Die  Eva  ist  doch  das  schönste  Weibchen  auf \ndem  Bilde  und  noch  immer  von  alters  her  ein  wenig \nlüstern. \n\nEin  paar  Porträte  von  Paul  Veronese  haben  meine  Hoch- \nachtung für  diesen  Künstler  nur  vermehrt.  Die  Antiken- \nsammlung ist  herrlich,  ein  hingestreckter  Sohn  der  Niobe \nköstlich,  die  Büsten,  ungeachtet  ihrer  restaurierten  Nasen, \nmeistens  höchst  interessant,  ein  August  mit  der  Bürger- \nkrone, ein  Caligula  und  andere. \n\nJ'ls  liegt  in  meiner  Natur,  das  Große  und  Schöne  willig \nund  mit  Freuden  zu  verehren,  und  diese  Anlage  an  so \nlaerrlichen  Gegenständen  Tag  für  Tag,  Stunde  für  Stunde \nauszubilden,  ist  das  seligste  aller  Gefühle. \nIn  einem  Lande,  wo  man  des  Tages  genießt,  besonders \naber  des  Abends  sich  erfreut,  ist  es  höchst  bedeutend, \nwenn  die  Nacht  einbricht.  Dann  hört  die  Arbeit  auf, \ndann  kehrt  der  Spaziergänger  zurück,  der  Vater  will  seine \nTochter  wieder  zu  Hause  sehen,  der  Tag  hat  ein  Ende; \ndoch  was  Tag  sei,  wissen  wir  Cimmerier  kaum.  In  ewi- \ngem Nebel  und  Trübe  ist  es  uns  einerlei,  ob  es  Tag  oder \nNacht  ist;  denn  wie  viel  Zeit  können  wir  uns  unter  freiem \nHimmel  wahrhaft  ergehen  und  ergötzen:  Wie  hier  die \nNacht  eintritt,  ist  der  Tag  entschieden  vorbei,  der  aus \nAbend  und  Morgen  bestand;  vierundzwanzig  Stunden  sind \nverlebt,  eine  neue  Rechnung  geht  an,  die  Glocken  läuten, \nder  Rosenkranz  wird  gebetet,  mit  brennender  Lampe  tritt \ndie  Magd  in  das  Zimmer  und  spricht:  Felicissima  nottc! \nDiese  Epoche  verändert  sich  mit  jeder  Jahreszeit,  und  der \nMensch,  der  hier  lebendig  lebt,  kann  nicht  irre  werden, \nweil  jeder  Genuß  seines  Daseins  sich  nicht  auf  die  Stunde, \nsondern  auf  die  Tageszeit  bezieht.  Zwänge  man  dem \nVolke  einen  deutschen  Zeiger  auf,  so  würde  man  es  ver- \nwirrt machen,  denn  der  seinige  ist  innigst  mit  seiner \nNatur  verwebt.  Anderthalb  Stunden,  eine  Stunde  vor \nNacht  fängt  der  Adel  an,  au.szufahren;   es  geht  auf  den \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  51 \n\nBrä,  die  lange  breite  Straße  nach  der  Porta  nuova  zu,  das \nTor  hinaus,  an  der  Stadt  hin,  und  wie  es  Nacht  schlägt, \nkehrt  alles  um.  Teils  fahren  sie  an  die  Kirchen,  das \nAve  Maria  della  sera  zu  beten,  teils  halten  sie  auf  dem \nBrä;  die  Kavaliers  treten  an  die  Kutschen,  unterhalten \nsich  mit  den  Damen,  und  das  dauert  eine  Weile,  ich  habe \ndas  Ende  niemals  abgewartet;  die  Fußgänger  bleiben \nweit  in  die  Nacht.  Heute  war  gerade  so  viel  Regen  nie- \ndergegangen, um  den  Staub  zu  löschen;  es  war  wirklich \nein  lebendiger,  munterer  Anblick. \n\nUm  mich  ferner  in  einem  wichtigen  Punkte  der  Landes- \ngewohnheit gleichzustellen,  habe  ich  mir  ein  Hilfsmittel \nerdacht,  wie  ich  ihre  Stundenrechnung  mir  leichter  zu \neigen  machte.  Nachfolgendes  Bild  kann  davon  einen  Be- \ngriff geben.  Der  innere  Kreis  bedeutet  unsere  vierund- \nzwanzig Stunden,  von  Mitternacht  zu  Mitternacht,  in \nzweimal  zwölf  geteilt,  wie  wir  zählen  und  unsere  Uhren \nsie  zeigen.  Der  mittlere  Kreis  deutet  an,  wie  die  Glocken \nin  der  jetzigen  Jahreszeit  hier  schlagen,  nämlich  gleich- \nfalls zweimal  bis  zwölf  in  vierundzwanzig  Stunden,  allein \ndergestalt,  daß  es  eins  schlägt,  wenn  es  bei  uns  acht \nschlüge,  und  so  fort,  bis  zwölfe  voll  sind.  Morgens  acht \nUhr  nach  unserm  Zeiger  schlägt  es  wieder  eins  usw.  Der \noberste  Kreis  zeigt  nun  endlich,  wie  bis  vierundzwanzig \nim  Leben  gezählt  wird.  Ich  höre  z.  B.  in  der  Nacht  sie- \nben schlagen  und  weiß,  daß  Mitternacht  um  fünf  ist,  so \nziehe  ich  diese  Zahl  von  jener  ab  und  habe  also  zwei \nUhr  Nachmitternacht.  Hör  ich  am  Tage  sieben  schlagen \nund  weiß,  daß  auch  Mittag  um  fünf  Uhr  ist,  so  verfahre \nich  ebenso  und  habe  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag.  Will  ich \naber  die  Stunden  nach  hiesiger  Weise  aussprechen,  so \nmuß  ich  wissen,  daß  Mittag  siebenzehn  Uhr  ist;  hiezu \nfüge  ich  noch  die  zwei  und  sage  neunzehn  Uhr.  Wenn \nman  dies  zum  erstenmal  hört  und  überdenkt,  so  scheint \nes  höchst  verworren  und  schwer  durchzuführen;  man  wird \nes  aber  gar  bald  gewohnt  und  findet  diese  Beschäftigung \nunterhaltend,  wie  sich  auch  das  Volk  an  dem  ewigen \nHin-  und  Widerrechnen  ergötzt,  wie  Kinder  an  leicht  zu \nüberwindenden    Schwierig-keiten.     Sie    haben    ohnedies \n\n\n52  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nimmer  die  Finger  in  der  Luft,  rechnen  alles  im  Kopfe \nund  machen  sich  gern  mit  Zahlen  zu  schaffen.  Ferner  ist \ndem  Inländer  die  Sache  so  viel  leichter,  weil  er  sich  um \nMittag  und  Mitternacht  eigentlich  nicht  bekümmert  und \nnicht,  wie  der  Fremde  in  diesem  Lande  tut,  zwei  Zeiger \nmiteinander  vergleicht.  Sie  zählen  nur  von  Abend  die \nStunden,  wie  sie  schlagen;  am  Tag  addieren  sie  die  Zahl \nzu  der  ihnen  bekannten  abwechselnden  Mittagszahl.  Das \nweitere  erläutern  die  der  Figur  beigefügten  Anmerkun- \ngen. (Siehe  das  nebenstehende  Blatt.) \nDas  Volk  rührt  sich  hier  sehr  lebhaft  durcheinander;  be- \nsonders in  einigen  Straßen,  wo  Kaufläden  und  Hand- \nwerksbuden aneinander  stoßen,  sieht  es  recht  lustig  aus. \nDa  ist  nicht  etwa  eine  Tür  vor  dem  Laden  oder  Arbeits- \nzimmer, nein,  die  ganze  Breite  des  Hauses  ist  often, \nman  sieht  bis  in  die  Tiefe  und  alles,  was  darin  vorgeht. \nDie  Schneider  nähen,  die  Schuster  ziehen  und  pochen \nalle  halb  auf  der  Gasse;  ja  die  Werkstätten  machen  einen \nTeil  der  Straße.  Abends,  wenn  Lichter  brennen,  sieht  es \nrecht  lebendig. \n\nAuf  den  Plätzen  ist  es  an  Markttagen  sehr  voll.  Gemüse \nund  Früchte  unübersehlich,  Knoblauch  und  Zwiebeln \nnach  Herzenslust.  Übrigens  schreien,  schäkern  und  singen \nsie  den  ganzen  Tag,  werfen  und  balgen  sich,  jauchzen \nund  lachen  unaufhörlich.  Die  milde  Luft,  die  wohlfeile \nNahrung  läßt  sie  leicht  leben.  Alles,  was  nur  kann,  ist \nunter  freiem  Himmel. \n\nNachts  geht  nun  das  Singen  und  Lärmen  recht  an.  Das \nLiedchen  von  Marlborough  hört  man  auf  allen  Straßen, \ndann  ein  Hackebrett,  eine  Violine.  Sie  üben  sich,  alle \nVögel  mit  Pfeifen  nachzumachen.  Die  wunderlichsten \nTöne  brechen  überall  hervor.  Ein  solches  Übergefühl  des \nDaseins  verleiht  ein  mildes  Klima  auch  der  Armut,  und \nder  Schatten  des  Volks  scheint  selbst  noch  ehrwürdig. \nDie  uns  so  sehr  auffallende  Unreinlichkeit  und  wenige \nBe(iuemlichkeit  der  Häuser  entspringt  auch  daher:  sie \nsind  immer  draußen,  und  in  ihrer  Sorglosigkeit  denken \nsie  an  nichts.  Dem  Volk  ist  alles  recht  und  gut;  der \nMittelmann  lebt  auch  von  einem  Tag  zum  andern;   der \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  53 \n\nVergleichlingskreis \n\nder  italienischen  und  deutschen  Uhr,  auch  der  italienischen \nZeiger  für  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  Septembers. \n\nM  i  1 1  a  ?. \n\n\nMitternacht. \n\nDi2  Nacht  wächst  mit  jedem  halben  Monat  eine  halbe  Stunde. \n\nMonat.

Ihre \nGesellschaften  halten  sie  in  öfifentlichen  Versammlungs- \nhiiusern.  Vorhöfe  und  Säulengänge  sind  alle  mit  Unrat \nbesudelt,  und  es  geht  ganz  natürlich  zu.  Das  Volk  fühlt \nsich  immer  vor.  Der  Reiche  kann  reich  sein,  Paläste \nbauen,  der  Nobile  darf  regieren,  aber  wenn  er  einen \nSäulengang,  einen  Vorhof  anlegt,  so  bedient  sich  das \nVolk  dessen  zu  seinem  Bedürfnis,  und  es  hat  kein  drin- \ngenderes, als  das  so  schnell  wie  möglich  loszuwerden, \nwas  es  so  häufig  als  möglich  zu  sich  genommen  hat.  Will \neiner  das  nicht  leiden,  so  muß  er  nicht  den  großen  Herrn \nspielen,  d.  h.  er  muß  nicht  tun,  als  wenn  ein  Teil  seiner \nWohnung  dem  Publikum  angehöre;  er  macht  seine  Türe \nzu,  und  so  ist  es  auch  gut.  An  öffentlichen  Gebäuden \nläßt  sich  das  Volk  sein  Recht  nun  gar  nicht  nehmen, \nund  das  ist's,  worüber  der  Fremde  durch  ganz  Italien \nBeschwerde  führt. \n\nIch  betrachtete  heut,  auf  mancherlei  Wegen  durch  die \nStadt,  die  Tracht  und  die  Manieren  besonders  des  Mittel- \nstandes, der  sich  sehr  häufig  und  geschäftig  zeigt.  Sie \nschlenkern  im  Gehen  alle  mit  den  Armen.  Personen  von \neinem  höhern  Stande,  die  bei  gewissen  Gelegenheiten \neinen  Degen  tragen,  schlenkern  nur  mit  ci/icm,  weil  sie \ngewohnt  sind,  den  linken  still  zu  halten. \nObgleich  das  Volk  seinen  Geschäften  und  Bedürfnissen \nsehr  sorglos  nachgeht,  so  hat  es  doch  auf  alles  Fremde \nein  scharfes  Auge.  So  könnt'  ich  die  ersten  Tage  be- \nmerken, daß  jedermann  meine  Stiefeln  betrachtete,  da \nman  sich  derselben  als  einer  feuern  Tracht  nicht  einmal \nim  Winter  bedient.  Jetzt,  da  ich  Schuh  und  Strümpfe \ntrage,  sieht  mich  niemand  mehr  an.  Aber  merkwürdig \nwar  mir's,  daß  heute  früh,  da  sie  alle  mit  Blumen,  Ge- \nmüse, Knoblauch  und  so  vielen  andern  Markterzeugnissen \ndurcheinander  liefen,  ihnen  der  Zypressenzweig  nicht  ent- \nging, den  ich  in  der  Hand  trug.  Einige  grüne  Zapfen \nhingen  daran,  und  daneben  hielt  ich  blühende  Kapem- \nzweige.  Sie  sahen  alle,  groß  und  klein,  mir  auf  die  Finger \nund  schienen  wunderliche  Gedanken  zu  haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  55 \n\nDiese  Zweige  bracht'  ich  aus  dem  Garten  Giusti,  der  eine \ntrefifliche  Lage  und  ungeheure  Zypressen  hat,  die  alle \npfriemenartig  in  die  Luft  stehen.  Wahrscheinlich  sind  die \nspitz  zugeschnittenen  Taxus  der  nordischen  Gartenkunst \nNachahmungen  dieses  herrlichen  Naturprodukts.  Ein \nBaum,  dessen  Zweige  von  unten  bis  oben,  die  ältesten \nwie  die  jüngsten,  gen  Himmel  streben,  der  seine  drei- \nhundert Jahre  dauert,  ist  wohl  der  Verehrung  wert.  Der \nZeit  nach,  da  der  Garten  angelegt  worden,  haben  diese \nschon  ein  so  hohes  Alter  erreicht. \n\nViccfiza,  den  ig.  Seftember. \nDer  Weg  von  Verona  hieher  ist  sehr  angenehm:  man  fährt \nnordostwärts  an  den  Gebirgen  hin  und  hat  die  Vorder- \nberge, die  aus  Sand,  Kalk,  Ton,  Mergel  bestehen,  immer \nlinker  Hand;  auf  den  Hügeln,  die  sie  bilden,  liegen  Orte, \nSchlösser,  Häuser.  Rechts  verbreitet  sich  die  weite  Fläche , \ndurch  die  man  fährt.  Der  gerade,  gut  unterhaltene,  breite \nWeg  geht  durch  fruchtbares  Feld;  man  blickt  in  tiefe  Baum- \nreihen, an  welchen  die  Reben  in  die  Höhe  gezogen  sind, \ndie  sodann,  als  wären  es  luftige  Zweige,  herunterfallen. \nHier  kann  man  sich  eine  Idee  von  Festonen  bilden!  Die \nTrauben  sind  zeitig  und  beschweren  die  Ranken,  die  lang \nund  schwankend  niederhängen.  Der  Weg  ist  voll  Menschen \naller  Art  und  Gewerbes;  besonders  freuten  mich  die  Wagen \nmit  niedrigen,  tellerartigen  Rädern,  die,  mit  vier  Ochsen \nbespannt,  große  Kufen  hin  und  wieder  führen,  in  welchen \ndie  Weintrauben  aus  den  Gärten  geholt  und  gestampft \nwerden.  Die  Führer  standen,  wenn  sie  leer  waren,  drinnen; \nes  sah  einem  Bacchischen  Triumphzug  ganz  ähnlich. \nZwischen  den  Weinreihen  ist  der  Boden  zu  allerlei  Arten \nGetreide,  besonders  zu  Türkischkorn  und  Sörgel  benutzt. \nKommt  man  gegen  Vicenza,  so  steigen  wieder  Hügel  von \nNorden  nach  Süden  auf — sie  sind  vulkanisch,  sagt  man \n— und  schließen  die  Ebene.  Vicenza  liegt  an  ihrem  Fuße \nund,  wenn  man  will,  in  einem  Busen,  den  sie  bilden. \n\nVor  einigen  Stunden  bin  ich  hier  angekommen,  habe  schon \ndie  Stadt  durchlaufen,  das  Olympische  Theater  und  die \n\n\n5  6  ITALTENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nGebäude  des  Palladio  gesehen.  Man  hat  ein  sehr  artiges \n]5üchelchen  mit  Kupfern  zur  Bequemlichkeit  der  Fremden \nherausgegeben,  mit  einem  kunstverständigen 'I'exte.  Wenn \nman  nun  diese  Werke  gegenwärtig  sieht,  so  erkennt  man \nerst  den  großen  Wert  derselben:  denn  sie  sollen  ja  durch \nilire  wirkliche  Größe  und  Körperlichkeit  das  Auge  füllen \nund  durch  die  schöne  Harmonie  ihrer  Dimensionen  nicht \nnur  in  abstrakten  Aufrissen,  sondern  mit  dem  ganzen  per- \nspektivischen Vordringen  und  Zurückweichen  den  Geist \nbefriedigen;  und  so  sag'  ich  vom  Palladio:  er  ist  ein  recht \ninnerlich  und  von  innen  heraus  großer  Mensch  gewesen. \nDie  höchste  Schwierigkeit,  mit  der  dieser  Mann,  wie  alle \nneuern  Architekten,  zu  kämpfen  hatte,  ist  die  schickliche \nAnwendung  der  Säulenordnungen  in  der  bürgerlichen  Bau- \nkunst: denn  Säulen  und  Mauern  zu  verbinden,  bleibt  doch \nimmer  ein  Widerspruch.  Aber  wie  er  das  untereinander \ngearbeitet  hat,  wie  er  durch  die  Gegenwart  seiner  Werke \nimponiert  und  vergessen  macht,  daß  er  nur  überredet!  Es \nist  wirklich  etwas  Göttliches  in  seinen  Anlagen,  völlig  wie \ndie  Force  des  großen  Dichters,  der  aus  Walu-heit  und \nLüge  ein  Drittes  bildet,  dessen  erborgtes  Dasein  uns  be- \nzaubert. \n\nDas  Olympische  Theater  ist  ein  Theater  der  Alten,  im \nkleinen  realisiert,  und  unaussprechlich  schön,  aber  gegen \ndie  unsrigen  kömmt  mir's  vor  wie  ein  vornehmes,  reiches, \nwohlgebildetes  Kind  gegen  einen  klugen  Wcltmenschen, \nder,  weder  so  vornehm  noch  so  reich,  noch  wohlgebildet, \nbesser  weiß,  was  er  mit  seinen  Mitteln  bewirken  kann. \nBeti-achtet  man  nun  hier  am  Orte  die  herrlichen  Gebäude, \ndie  jener  Mann  auffiihrte,  und  sieht,  wie  sie  schon  durch \ndas  enge  schmutzige  Bedürfnis  der  Menschen  entstellt \nsind,  wie  die  Anlagen  meist  über  die  Kräfte  der  Unter- \nnehmer Avaren,  wie  wenig  diese  köstlichen  Denkmale  eines \nhohen  Menschengeistes  zu  dem  Leben  der  übrigen  passen, \nso  fällt  einem  denn  doch  ein,  daß  es  in  allem  andern  eben- \nso ist:  denn  man  verdient  wenig  Dank  von  den  Menschen, \nwenn  man  ihr  inneres  Bedürfnis  erhöhen,  ihnen  eine  große \nIdee  von  ihnen  selbst  geben,  ihnen  das  Herrliche  eines \nwahren  edlen  Daseins  zum  Gefühl  bringen  will.     Aber \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  57 \n\nwenn  man  die  Vögel  belügt,  Märchen  erzählt,  von  Tag  zu \nTag  ihnen  forthelfend  sie  verschlechtert,  da  ist  man  ihr \nMann,  imd  darum  gefällt  sich  die  neuere  Zeit  in  so  viel \nAbgeschmacktem.  Ich  sage  das  nicht,  um  meine  Freunde \nherunterzusetzen,  ich  sage  nur,  daß  sie  so  sind  und  daß \nman  sich  nicht  verwundern  muß,  wenn  alles  ist,  wie \nes  ist. \n\nWie  sich  die  Basilika  des  Palladio  neben  einem  alten,  mit \nungleichen  Fenstern  übersäten,  kastellähnhchen  Gebäude \nausnimmt,  welches  der  Baumeister  zusamt  dem  Turm \ngewiß  weggedacht  hat,  ist  nicht  auszudrücken,  und  ich \nmuß  mich  schon  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  zusammen- \nfassen: denn  ich  finde  auch  hier — leider  gleich!  —  das, \nwas  ich  fliehe  und  suche,  nebeneinander. \n\nDen  20.  September. \nGestern  war  Oper,  sie  dauerte  bis  nach  Mitternacht,  und \nich  sehnte  mich  zu  ruhen.  \"Die  drei  Sultaninnen\"  und  \"Die \nEntführung  aus  dem  Serail\"  haben  manche  Fetzen  her- \ngegeben, woraus  das  Stück  mit  weniger  Klugheit  zu- \nsammengeflickt ist.  Die  Musik  hört  sich  bequem  an,  ist \naber  wahrscheinlich  von  einem  Liebhaber;  kein  neuer \nGedanke,  der  mich  getroffen  hätte.  Die  Ballette  dagegen \nsind  allerliebst.  Das  Hauptpaar  tanzte  eine  Allemande, \ndaß  man  nichts  Zierlicheres  sehen  konnte. \nDas  Theater  ist  neu,  lieblich,  schön,  modest-prächtig, \nalles  uniform,  wie  es  einer  Provinzialstadt  geziemt;  jede \nLoge  hat  ihren  übergeschlagenen,  gleichfarbigen  Teppich, \ndie  des  Capitan  Grande  ist  nur  durch  einen  etwas  längern \nÜberhang  ausgezeichnet. \n\nDie  erste  Sängerin,  vom  ganzen  Volke  sehr  begünstigt, \nwird,  wie  sie  auftritt,  entsetzlich  beklatscht,  und  die  Vögel \nstellen  sich  vor  Freuden  ganz  ungebärdig,  wenn  sie  etwas \nrecht  gut  macht,  welches  sehr  oft  geschieht.  Es  ist  ein \nnatürlich  Wesen,  hübsche  Figur,  schöne  Stimme,  ein  ge- \nfällig Gesicht  und  von  einem  recht  honetten  Anstand;  in \nden  Armen  könnte  sie  etwas  mehr  Grazie  haben.  In- \ndessen komme  ich  denn  doch  nicht  wieder;  ich  fühle,  daß \nich  zum  Vogel  verdorben  bin. \n\n\n58  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  21 .  September. \nHeute  besuchte  ich  Dr.  Turra;  wohl  fünf  Jahre  hat  er  sich \nmit  Leidenschaft  auf  die  Pflanzenkunde  gelegt,  ein  Herba- \nrium der  italienischen  Flora  gesammelt,  unter  dem  vorigen \nBischof  einen  botanischen  Garten  eingerichtet.  Das  ist \naber  alles  hin.  Medizinische  Praxis  vertrieb  die  Natur- \ngeschichte, das  Herbarium  wird  von  Würmern  gespeist, \nder  Bischof  ist  tot,  und  der  botanische  Garten  wieder, \nwie  billig,  mit  Kohl  und  Knoblauch  bepflanzt. \nDr.  Turra  ist  ein  gar  feiner  guter  Mann.  Er  erzählte  mir \nmit  Offenheit,  Seelenreinheit  und  Bescheidenheit  seine \nGeschichte  und  sprach  überhaupt  sehr  bestimmt  und  ge- \nfällig, hatte  aber  nicht  Lust,  seine  Schränke  aufzutun,  die \nvielleicht  in  keinem  präsentablen  Zustande  sein  mochten. \nDer  Diskurs  kam  bald  ins  Stocken. \n\nAbends. \nIch  ging  zum  alten  I'aumeister  Scamozzi,  der  des  Palladio \nGebäude  herausgegeben  hat  und  ein  wackerer,  leiden- \nschaftlicher Künstler  ist.  Er  gab  mir  einige  Anleitung, \nvergnügt  über  meine  Teilnahme.  Unter  den  Gebäuden \ndes  Palladio  ist  eins,  für  das  ich  immer  eine  besondere \nVorliebe  hatte,  es  soll  seine  eigne  Wohnung  gewesen  sein; \naber  in  der  Nähe  ist  es  weit  mehr,  als  man  im  Bilde  sieht. \nIch  möchte  es  gezeichnet  und  mit  den  Farben  illuminiert \nhaben,  die  ihm  das  Material  und  das  Alter  gegeben.  Man \nmuß  aber  nicht  denken,  daß  der  Baumeister  sich  einen \nPalast  errichtet  habe.  Es  ist  das  bescheidenste  Haus  von \nder  Welt,  hat  nur  zwei  Fenster,  die  durch  einen  breiten \nRaum,  der  das  dritte  Fenster  vertrüge,  abgesondert  sind. \nWollte  man  es  zumCiemälde  nachbilden,  so  daß  die  Nach- \nbarhäuser mit  vorgestellt  würden,  so  wäre  auch  das  ver- \ngnüglich anzusehen,  wie  es  zwischen  sie  eingeschaltet  ist. \nDas  hätte  Canaletto  malen  sollen. \n\nHeute  besuchte  ich  das  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  der  Stadt \nauf  einer  angenehmen  Höhe  liegende  Prachthaus,  die \nRotonda  genannt.  Es  ist  ein  viereckiges  Gebäude,  das \neinen  runden,  von  oben  erleuchteten  Saal  in  sich  schließt. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  59 \n\nVon  allen  vier  Seiten  steigt  man  auf  breiten  Treppen \nhinan  und  gelangt  jedesmal  in  eine  Vorhalle,  die  von \nsechs  korinthischen  Säulen  gebildet  wird.  Vielleicht  hat \ndie  Baukunst  iliren  Luxus  niemals  höher  getrieben.  Der \nRaum,  den  die  Treppen  und  Vorhallen  einnehmen,  ist \nviel  größer  als  der  des  Hauses  selbst;  denn  jede  einzelne \nSeite  würde  als  Ansicht  eines  Tempels  befriedigen.  In- \nwendig kann  man  es  wohnbar,  aber  nicht  wohnlich \nnennen.  Der  Saal  ist  von  der  schönsten  Proportion,  die \nZimmer  auch;  aber  zu  den  Bedürfnissen  eines  Sommer- \naufenthalts einer  vornehmen  Familie  würden  sie  kaum \nhinreichen.  Dafür  sieht  man  es  auch  in  der  ganzen  Gegend, \nvon  allen  Seiten,  sich  auf  das  herrlichste  darstellen.  Die \nMannigfaltigkeit  ist  groß,  in  der  sich  seine  Hauptmasse \nzugleich  mit  den  vorspringenden  Säulen  vor  dem  Auge \nder  Umherwandelnden  bewegt,  und  die  Absicht  des  Be- \nsitzers ist  vollkommen  erreicht,  der  ein  großes  Fidei- \nkommißgut  und  zugleich  ein  sinnliches  Denkmal  seines \nVermögens  hinterlassen  wollte.  Und  wie  nun  das  Ge- \nbäude von  allen  Punkten  der  Gegend  in  seiner  Herrlich- \nkeit gesehen  wird,  so  ist  die  Aussicht  von  daher  gleich- \nfalls die  angenehmste.  Man  sieht  den  Bachiglione  fließen, \nSchifte  von  Verona  herab  gegen  die  Brenta  führend;  dabei \nüberschaut  man  die  weiten  Besitzungen,  welche  Marchese \nCapra  unzertrennt  bei  seiner  Familie  erhalten  wollte.  Die \nInschriften  der  vier  Giebelseiten,  die  zusammen  eine \nganze  ausmachen,  verdienen  wohl  aufgezeichnet  zu  werden: \nMarcus  Capra  Gabrielis  filius \nqui  aedes  has \narctissimo  primogeniturae  gradui  subjecit \nuna  cum  Omnibus \ncensibus  agris  vallibus  et  collibus \n\ncitra  viam  magnam \nmemoriae  perpetuae  mandans  haec \ndum  sustinet  ac  abstinet. \nDer  Schluß  besonders  ist  seltsam  genug:  ein  Mann,  dem \nso  viel  Vermögen  und  Wille  zu  Gebote  stand,  fühlt  noch, \ndaß  er  dulden  und  entbehren  müsse.    Das  kann  man  mit \ngerinsferm  Aufwand  lernen. \n\n\n6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  22.  September. \nHeute  abend  war  ich  in  einer  Versammlung,  welche  die \nAkademie  der  Olympier  hielt.  Ein  Spielwerk,  aber  ein \nrecht  gutes;  es  erhält  noch  ein  bißchen  Salz  und  Leben \nunter  den  Leuten.  Ein  großer  Saal  neben  dem  Theater \ndes  Palladio,  anständig  erleuchtet,  der  Capitan  und  ein \nTeil  des  Adels  zugegen,  übrigens  durchaus  ein  Publikum \nvon  gebildeten  Personen,  viele  Geistliche,  zusammen  ohn- \ngefähr  fünfhundert. \n\nDie  von  dem  Präsidenten  für  die  heutige  Sitzung  auf- \ngegebene Frage  war:  ob  Erfindung  oder  Nachahmung  den \nschönen  Künsten  melir  Vorteil  gebracht  habe?  Der  Ein- \nfall war  glücklich  genug;  denn  wenn  man  die  in  der  Frage \nliegende  Alternative  trennt,  so  läßt  sich  hundert  Jahre \nhinüber  und  herüber  sprechen.  Auch  haben  sich  die \nHerrn  Akademiker  dieser  Gelegenheit  weidlich  bedient \nund  in  Prosa  und  Versen  mancherlei  hervorgebracht,  wor- \nunter viel  Gutes. \n\nSodann  ist  es  das  lebendigste  Publikum.  Die  Zuhörer \nriefen  bravo,  klatschten  und  lachten.  Wenn  man  auch \nvor  seiner  Nation  so  stehen  und  sie  persönlich  belustigen \ndürfte!  Wir  geben  unser  Bestes  schwarz  auf  weiß:  jeder \nkauzt  sich  damit  in  eine  Ecke  und  knopert  daran,  wie  er \nkann. \n\nEs  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  Palladio  auch  diesmal  an  allen \nOrten  und  Enden  war,  es  mochte  vom  Erfinden  oder \nNachahmen  die  Rede  sein.  Zuletzt,  wo  immer  das  Scherz- \nliafteste  gefordert  wird,  hatte  einer  den  glücklichen  Ein- \nfall, zu  sagen:  die  andern  hätten  ihm  den  Palladio  weg- \ngenommen, er  wolle  dagegen  den  Franceschini  loben, \nden  großen  Seidenfabrikanten.  Nun  fing  er  an,  zu  zeigen, \nwas  die  Nachahmung  der  Lyoner  und  Florentiner  Stoffe \ndiesem  tüchtigen  Unternehmer  und  durch  ihn  der  Stadt \nVicenza  für  Vorteil  gebracht  habe,  woraus  erfolge,  daß \ndie  Nachahmung  weit  über  die  Erfindung  erhaben  sei. \nUnd  dies  geschah  mit  so  gutem  Humor,  daß  ein  ununter- \nbrochenes Gelächter  erregt  ward.  Überhaupt  fanden  die, \nwelche  für  die  Nachahmung  sprachen,  mehr  Beifall;  denn \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  61 \n\nsie  sagten  lauter  Dinge,  wie  sie  der  Haufen  denkt  und \ndenken  kann.  Einmal  gab  das  Publikum  mit  großem \nHändeklatschen  einem  recht  groben  Sophism  seinen  herz- \nlichen Beifall,  da  es  viele  gute,  ja  treffliche  Sachen  zu \nEhren  der  Erfindung  nicht  gefühlt  hatte.  Es  freut  mich \nsehr,  auch  dieses  erlebt  zu  haben,  und  dann  ist  es  höchst \nerquickend,  den  Palladio  nach  so  viel  Zeit  immer  noch \nals  Polarstern  und  Musterbild  von  seinen  Mitbürgern  ver- \nehrt zu  sehen. \n\nVicenza^  den  23.  September. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  in  Tiene,  das  nordwärts  gegen  die \nGebirge  liegt,  wo  ein  neu  Gebäude  nach  einem  alten \nRisse  aufgeführt  wird,  wobei  wenig  zu  erinnern  sein \nmöchte.  So  ehrt  man  hier  alles  aus  der  guten  Zeit  und \nhat  Sinn  genug,  nach  einem  geerbten  Plan  ein  frisches \nGebäude  aufzuführen.  Das  Schloß  liegt  ganz  trefilich  in \neiner  großen  Plaine,  die  Kalkalpen  ohne  Zwischengebirg \nhinter  sich.  Vom  Gebäude  her,  neben  der  schnurgeraden \nChaussee,  fließt  zu  beiden  Seiten  lebendiges  Wasser  dem \nKommenden  entgegen  und  wässert  die  weiten  Reisfelder, \ndurch  die  man  fährt. \n\nIch  habe  nun  erst  die  zwei  italienischen  Städte  gesehen \nund  mit  wenig  Menschen  gesprochen,  aber  ich  kenne \nmeine  Italiener  schon  gut.  Sie  sind  wie  Hofleute,  die \nsich  fürs  erste  Volk  in  der  Welt  halten  und  bei  gewissen \nVorteilen,  die  man  ihnen  nicht  leugnen  kann,  sich's  un- \ngestraft und  bequem  einbilden  können.  Mir  erscheinen  die \nItaliener  als  eine  recht  gute  Nation:  man  muß  nur  die \nKinder  und  die  gemeinen  Leute  sehen,  wie  ich  sie  jetzt \nsehe  und  sehen  kann,  da  ich  ihnen  immer  ausgesetzt  bin \nund  mich  ihnen  immer  aussetze.  Und  was  das  für  Figuren \nund  Gesichter  sind! \n\nBesonders  muß  ich  die  Vicentiner  loben,  daß  man  bei \nihnen  die  Vorrechte  einer  großen  Stadt  genießt.  Sie  sehen \neinen  nicht  an,  man  mag  machen,  was  man  will;  wendet \nman  sich  jedoch  an  sie,  dann  sind  sie  gesprächig  und  an- \nmutig, besonders  wollen  mir  die  Frauen  sehr  gefallen. \nDie  Veroneserinnen  will  ich  nicht  schelten,  sie  haben  eine \n\n\n62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngute  Bildung  und  entschiedeneProfile;  aber  meistens  bleich, \nund  der  Zendal  tut  ihnen  Schaden,  weil  man  unter  der \nschönen  Tracht  auch  etwas  Reizendes  sucht.  Hier  aber \nfinde  ich  gar  hübsche  Wesen,  besonders  eine  schwarz- \nlockige Sorte,  die  mir  ein  eigenes  Interesse  einflößt.  Es \ngibt  auch  noch  eine  blonde,  die  mir  aber  nicht  so  be- \nhagen will. \n\nPadiia^  den  26.  September  abends. \nIn  vier  Stunden  bin  ich  heute  von  Vicenza  herübergefahren, \nauf  ein  einsitziges  Chaischen,  Sediola  genannt,  mit  meiner, \nganzen  Existenz  gepackt.  Man  fährt  sonst  bequem  in  viert- \nhalb Stunden;  da  ich  aber  den  köstlichen  Tag  gern  unter \nfreiem  Himmel  genießen  wollte,  so  war  es  mir  angenehm, \ndaß  der  Vetturin  hinter  seiner  Schuldigkeit  zurückblieb. \nMan  fährt  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Ebene  immer  südostwärts, \nzwischen  Hecken  und  Bäumen,  ohne  weitere  Aussicht,  bis \nman  endlich  die  schönen  Gebirge,  von  Norden  gegen \nSüden  streichend,  zur  rechten  Hand  sieht.  Die  Fülle  der \nPflanzen-  und  Fruchtgehänge,  über  Mauern  und  Hecken, \nan  Bäumen  herunter,  ist  unbesclireiblich.  Kürbisse  be- \nschweren die  Dächer,  und  die  wunderlichsten  Gurken \nhängen  an  Latten  und  Spalieren. \n\nDie  herrliche  Lage  der  Stadt  konnte  ich  vom  Observa- \ntorium aufs  klarste  überschauen.  Gegen  Norden  Tiroler \nGebirge,  beschneit,  in  Wolken  halb  versteckt,  an  die \nsich  in  Nordwest  die  Vicentinischen  anschließen,  endlich \ngegen  Westen  die  näheren  Gebirge  von  Este,  deren  Ge- \nstalten und  Vertiefungen  man  deutlich  sehen  kann.  Gegen \nSüdost  ein  grünes  Pflanzenmeer,  ohne  eine  Spur  von \nErhöhung,  Baum  an  Baum,  Busch  an  Busch,  Pflanzung \nan  Pflanzung,  unzählige  weiße  Häuser,  Villen  und  Kirchen \naus  dem  Grünen  hervorblickend.  Am  Horizont  sah  ich \nganz  deutlich  den  Markusturm  zu  Venedig  und  andere \ngeringere  Türme. \n\nFadi/a^  den  27.  September. \nEndlich  hab'  ich  die  Werke  des  Palladio  erlangt,  zwar \nnicht  die  Originalausgabe,  die  ich  in  Vicenza  gesehen, \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  St, \n\nderen  Tafeln  in  Holz  geschnitten  sind,  aber  eine  genaue \nKopie,  ja  ein  Faksimile  in  Kupfer,  veranstaltet  durch  einen \nvortrefflichen  Mann,  den  ehemaligen  englischen  Konsul \nSmith  in  Venedig.  Das  muß  man  den  Engländern  lassen, \ndaß  sie  von  lange  her  das  Gute  zu  schätzen  wußten \nund  daß  sie  eine  grandiose  Art  haben,  es  zu  verbreiten. \nBei  Gelegenheit  dieses  Ankaufs  betrat  ich  einen  Buch- \nladen, der  in  Italien  ein  ganz  eigenes  Ansehen  hat.  Alle \nBücher  stehen  geheftet  umher,  und  man  findet  den  ganzen \nTag  über  gute  Gesellschaft.  Was  von  Weltgeistlichen, \nEdelleuten,  Künstlern  einigermaßen  mit  der  Literatur \nverwandt  ist,  geht  hier  auf  und  ab.  Man  verlangt  ein \nBuch,  schlägt  nach,  liest  und  unterhält  sich,  wie  es  kommen \nwill.  So  fand  ich  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  beisammen, \nwelche  sämtlich,  als  ich  nach  den  Werken  des  Palladio \nfragte,  auf  mich  aufmerksam  wurden.  Indes  der  Herr  des \nLadens  das  Buch  suchte,  rühmten  sie  es  und  gaben  mir \nNotiz  von  dem  Originale  und  der  Kopie;  sie  waren  mit \ndem  Werke  selbst  und  dem  Verdienst  des  Verfassers \nsehr  wohl  bekannt.  Da  sie  mich  für  einen  Architekten \nhielten,  lobten  sie  mich,  daß  ich  vor  allen  andern  zu  den \nStudien  dieses  Meisters  schritte;  er  leiste  zu  Gebrauch \nund  Anwendung  mehr  als  Vitruv  selbst,  denn  er  habe \ndie  Alten  und  das  Altertum  gründlich  studiert  und  es \nunsern  Bedürfnissen  näher  zu  führen  gesucht.  Ich  unter- \nhielt mich  lange  mit  diesen  freundlichen  Männern,  er- \nfuhr noch  einiges,  die  Denkwürdigkeiten  der  Stadt  be- \ntreffend, und  empfahl  mich. \n\nDa  man  denn  doch  einmal  den  Heiligen  Kirchen  gebaut \nhat,  so  findet  sich  auch  wohl  darin  ein  Platz,  wo  man \nvernünftige  Menschen  aufstellen  kann.  Die  Büste  des \nKardinals  Bembo  steht  zwischen  ionischen  Säulen,  ein \nschönes,  wenn  ich  so  sagen  soll  mit  Gewalt  in  sich  ge- \nzogenes Gesicht  und  ein  mächtiger  Bart;  die  Inschrift \nlautet: \n\nPetri  Bembi  Card,  imaginem  Hier.  Guerinus  Ismeni  f.  in \n\npublico  ponendam  curavit  ut  cujus  ingenii  monumenta \n\naeterna  sint  ejus  corporis  quoque  memoria  ne  a  poste- \n\nritate  desideretur. \n\n\n64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDas  Universitätsgebäude  hat  mich  mit  aller  seiner  Würde \nerschreckt.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  darin  nichts  zu  lernen \nhatte.  Eine  solche  Schulenge  denkt  man  sich  nicht,  ob \nman  gleich  als  Studiosus  deutscher  Akademien  auf  den \nHörbänken  auch  manches  leiden  müssen.  Besonders  ist \ndas  anatomische  Theater  ein  Muster,  wie  man  Schüler \nzusammenpressen  soll.  In  einem  spitzen  hohen  Trichter \nsind  die  Zuhörer  übereinander  geschichtet.  Sie  sehen \nsteil  herunter  auf  den  engen  Boden,  wo  der  Tisch  steht, \nauf  den  kein  Licht  fällt;  deshalb  der  Lehrer  bei  Lampen- \nschein demonstrieren  muß.  Der  botanische  Garten  ist \ndesto  artiger  und  munterer.  Es  können  viele  Pflanzen \nauch  den  Winter  im  Lande  bleiben,  wenn  sie  an  Mauern \noder  nicht  weit  davon  gesetzt  sind.  Man  überbaut  als- \ndann das  Ganze  zu  Ende  des  Oktobers  und  heizt  die \nwenigen  Monate.  Es  ist  erfreuend  und  belehrend,  unter \neiner  Vegetation  umherzugehen,  die  uns  fremd  ist.  Bei \ngewohnten  Pflanzen,  sowie  bei  andern  längst  bekannten \nGegenständen,  denken  wir  zuletzt  gar  nichts;  und  was  ist \nBeschauen  ohne  Denken?  Hier  in  dieser  neu  mir  ent- \ngegentretenden Mannigfaltigkeit  wird  jener  Gedanke \nimmer  lebendiger,  daß  man  sich  alle  Pflanzengestalten \nvielleicht  aus  ei7icr  entwickeln  könne.  Hierdurch  würde \nes  allein  möglich  werden,  Geschlechter  und  Arten  wahr- \nhaft zu  bestimmen,  welches,  wie  mich  dünkt,  bisher  sehr \nwillkürlich  geschieht.  Auf  diesem  Punkte  bin  ich  in  meiner \nbotanischen  Philosophie  stecken  geblieben,  und  ich  sehe \nnoch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich  entwirren  will.  Die  Tiefe  und \nBreite  dieses  Geschäfts  scheint  mir  völlig  gleich. \nDer  große  Platz,  Prato  della  Valle  genannt,  ist  ein  selir \nweiter  Raum,  wo  der  Hauptmarkt  im  Juni  gehalten  wird. \nHölzerne  Buden  in  seiner  Mitte  geben  freilich  nicht  das \nvorteilhafteste  Ansehen,  die  Einwohner  aber  versichern, \ndaß  man  auch  bald  hier  eine  Fiera  von  Stein,  wie  die \nzu  Verona,  sehen  werde.  Hiezu  gibt  freilich  schon  jetzt  die \nUmgebung  des  Platzes  gegründete  Hoftnung,  welche  einen \nsehr  schönen  und  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährt. \nEin  ungeheures  Oval  ist  ringsum  mit  Statuen  besetzt,  alle \nberühmte  Männer  vorstellend,  welche  hier  gelehrt  und \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  65 \n\ngelernt  haben.  Einem  jeden  Einheimischen  und  Fremden \nist  erlaubt,  irgend  einem  Landsmann  oder  Verwandten \nhier  eine  Bildsäule  von  bestimmter  Größe  zu  errichten, \nsobald  das  Verdienst  der  Person  und  der  akademische \nAufenthalt  zu  Padua  bewiesen  ist. \n\nUm  das  Oval  umher  geht  ein  Wassergraben.  Auf  den \nvier  Brücken,  die  hinaufführen,  stehen  Päpste  und  Dogen \nkolossal;  die  übrigen,  kleiner,  sind  von  Zünften,  Partiku- \nliers  und  Fremden  gesetzt.  Der  König  von  Schweden \nließ  Gustav  Adolfen  hinstellen,  weil  man  sagt,  derselbe \nhabe  einmal  in  Padua  eine  Lektion  angehört.  Der  Erz- \nherzog Leopold  erneuerte  das  Andenken  Petrarchs  und \nGalileis.  Die  Statuen  sind  in  einer  braven  modernen \nManier  gemacht,  wenige  übermanieriert,  einige  recht \nnatürlich,  sämtlich  im  Kostüm  ihrer  Zeit  und  Würden. \nDie  Inschriften  sind  auch  zu  loben.  Es  findet  sich  nichts \nAbgeschmacktes  oder  Kleinliches  darunter. \nAuf  jeder  Universität  wäre  der  Gedanke  sehr  glücklich \ngewesen,  auf  dieser  ist  er  am  glücklichsten,  weil  es  sehr \nwohl  tut,  eine  völlige  Vergangenheit  wieder  hervorge- \nrufen zu  sehen.  Es  kann  ein  recht  schöner  Platz  werden, \nwenn  sie  die  hölzerne  Fiera  wegschafien  und  eine  von \nStein  erbauen,  wie  der  Plan  sein  soll. \n\nIn  dem  Versammlungsorte  einer  dem  heiligen  Antonius \ngewidmeten  Brüderschaft  sind  ältere  Bilder,  welche  an \ndie  alten  Deutschen  erinnern,  dabei  auch  einige  von \nTizian,  wo  schon  der  große  Fortschritt  merklich  ist,  den \nüber  den  Alpen  niemand  für  sich  getan  hat.  Gleich  dar- \nauf sah  ich  einiges  von  den  Neusten.  Diese  Künstler \nhaben,  da  sie  das  hohe  Ernste  nicht  mehr  erreichen \nkonnten,  das  Humoristische  sehr  glücklich  getroffen.  Die \nEnthauptung  Johannes'  von  Piazetta  ist,  wenn  man  des \nMeisters  Manier  zugibt,  in  diesem  Sinne  ein  recht  braves \nBild.  Johannes  kniet,  die  Hände  vor  sich  hinfaltend,  mit \ndem  rechten  Knie  an  einen  Stein.  Er  sieht  gen  Himmel. \nEin  Kriegsknecht,  der  ihn  hinten  gebunden  hält,  biegt \nsich  an  der  Seite  herum  und  sieht  ihm  ins  Gesicht,  als \nwenn  er  über  die  Gelassenheit  erstaunte,  womit  der  Mann \n\nGOETHE  IV  5 \n\n\n66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich  hingibt.  In  der  Höhe  steht  ein  anderer,  der  den \nStreich  vollführen  soll,  hat  aber  das  Schwert  nicht,  son- \ndern macht  nur  mit  den  Händen  die  Gebärde,  wie  einer, \nder  den  Streich  zum  voraus  versuchen  will.  Das  Schwert \nzieht  unten  ein  dritter  aus  der  Scheide.  Der  Gedanke \nist  glücklich,  wenn  auch  nicht  groß,  die  Komposition \nfrappant  und  von  der  besten  Wirkung. \nIn  der  Kirche  der  Eremitaner  habe  ich  Gemälde  von \nMantegna  gesehen,  einem  der  älteren  Maler,  vor  dem \nich  erstaunt  bin.  Was  in  diesen  Bildern  für  eine  scharfe, \nsichere  Gegenwart  dasteht!  Von  dieser  ganz  wahren, \nnicht  etwa  scheinbaren,  eftektlügenden,  bloß  zur  Ein- \nbildungskraft sprechenden,  sondern  derben,  reinen,  lich- \nten, ausführlichen,  gewissenhaften,  zarten,  umschriebenen \nGegenwart,  die  zugleich  etwas  Strenges,  Emsiges,  Müh- \nsames hatte,  gingen  die  folgenden  Maler  aus,  wie  ich  an \nBildern  von  Tizian  bemerkte,  und  nun  konnte  die  Leb- \nhaftigkeit ihres  Genies,  die  Energie  ihrer  Natur,  erleuchtet \nvon  dem  Geiste  ihrer  Vorfahren,  auferbaut  durch  ihre \nKraft,  immer  höher  und  höher  steigen,  sich  von  der  Erde \nheben  und  himmlische,  aber  wahre  Gestalten  hervor- \nbringen. So  entwickelte  sich  die  Kunst  nach  der  bar- \nbarischen Zeit. \n\nDer  Audienzsaal  des  Rathauses,  mit  Recht  durch  das \nAugmentativum  \"Salone\"  betitelt,  das  ungeheuerste  abge- \nschlossene Gefäß,  das  man  sich  nicht  vorstellen,  auch \nnicht  einmal  in  der  nächsten  Erinnerung  ziu\"ückrufen  kann. \nDreihundert  Euß  lang,  hundert  Euß  breit  und  bis  in  das \nder  Länge  nach  ihn  deckende  Gewölbe  hundert  Euß \nhoch.  So  gewohnt  sind  diese  Menschen,  im  Freien  zu \nleben,  daß  die  Baumeister  einen  Marktplatz  zu  über- \nwölben fanden. \n\nUnd  es  ist  keine  Frage,  daß  der  ungeheuere  überwölbte \nRaum  eine  eigene  Empfindung  gibt.  Es  ist  ein  abge- \nschloßnes  Unendliches,  dem  ISlenschen  analoger  als  der \nSternhimmel.  Dieser  reißt  uns  aus  uns  selbst  hinaus, \njener  drängt  uns,  auf  die  gelindeste  Weise,  in  uns  selbst \nzurück. \nSo  verweil  ich    auch   gern  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  67 \n\nJustine.  Diese  ist  vierhundertfünfundachtzig  Fuß  lang, \nverhältnismäßig  hoch  und  breit,  groß  und  einfach  gebaut. \nHeut'  abend  setzt'  ich  mich  in  einen  Winkel  und  hatte \nmeine  stille  Betrachtung.  Da  fühlt'  ich  mich  recht \nallein,  denn  kein  Mensch  in  der  Welt,  der  in  dem  Augen- \nblick an  mich  gedacht  hätte,  würde  mich  hier  gesucht \nhaben. \n\nNun  wäre  auch  hier  wieder  einmal  eingepackt;  morgen \nfrüh  geht  es  zu  Wasser  auf  der  Brenta  fort.  Heute  hat's \ngeregnet,  nun  ist's  wieder  ausgehellt,  und  ich  hoffe,  die \nLagunen  und  die  dem  Meer  vermählte  Herrscherin  bei \nschöner  Tageszeit  zu  erblicken  und  aus  ihrem  Schoß \nmeine  Freunde  zu  begrüßen. \n\nVENEDIG \n\nSO  stand  es  denn  im  Buche  des  Schicksals  auf  meinem \nBlatte  geschrieben,  daß  ich  1786  den  achtundzwanzig- \nsten September,  abends,  nach  unserer  Uhr  um  fünfe, \nVenedig  zum  erstenmal,  aus  der  Brenta  in  die  Lagunen \neinfahrend,  erblicken  und  bald  darauf  diese  wunderbare \nInselstadt,  diese  Biberrepublik,  betreten  und  besuchen \nsollte.  So  ist  denn  auch,  Gott  sei  Dank,  Venedig  mir  kein \nbloßes  Wort  mehr,  kein  hohler  Name,  der  mich  so  oft, \nmich,  den  Todfeind  von  Wortschällen,  geängstiget  hat. \nAls  die  erste  Gondel  an  das  Schiff  anfuhr — es  geschieht, \num  Passagiere,  welche  Eil'  haben,  geschwinder  nach \nVenedig  zu  bringen — erinnerte  ich  mich  eines  frühen \nKinderspielzeuges,  an  das  ich  vielleicht  seit  zwanzig \nJahren  nicht  mehr  gedacht  hatte.  Mein  Vater  besaß  ein \nschönes  mitgebrachtes  Gondelmodell;  er  hielt  es  sehr \nwert,  und  mir  ward  es  hoch  angerechnet,  wenn  ich  ein- \nmal damit  spielen  durfte.  Die  ersten  Schnäbel  von  blankem \nEisenblech,  die  schwarzen  Gondelkäfige,  alles  grüßte  mich \nwie  eine  alte  Bekanntschaft,  ich  genoß  einen  langent- \nbehrten freundlichen  Jugendeindruck. \nIch  bin  gut  logiert  in  der  Königin  von  England,  nicht \nweit  vom  Markusplatze,  und  dies  ist  der  größte  Vorzug \ndes  Quartiers;  meine  Fenster  gehen  auf  einen  schmalen \n\n\n68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nKanal  zwischen  hohen  Häusern,  gleich  unter  mir  eine \neinbogige  Brücke,  und  gegenüber  ein  schmales,  belebtes \nGäßchen.  So  wohne  ich,  und  so  werde  ich  eine  Zeitlang \nbleiben,  bis  mein  Paket  für  Deutschland  fertig  ist  und \nbis  ich  mich  am  Bilde  dieser  Stadt  satt  gesehen  habe. \nDie  Einsamkeit,  nach  der  ich  oft  so  sehnsuchtvoll  ge- \nseufzt, kann  ich  nun  recht  genießen;  denn  nirgends  fühlt \nman  sich  einsamer  als  im  Gewimmel,  wo  man  sich,  allen \nganz  unbekannt,  durchdrängt.  In  Venedig  kennt  mich \nvielleicht  nur  ein  Mensch,  und  der  wird  mir  nicht  gleich \nbegegnen. \n\nVenedig^  den  28.  September  j^86. \nWie  es  mir  von  Padua  hierher  gegangen,  nur  mit  wenig \nWorten:  Die  Fahrt  auf  der  Brenta,  mit  dem  öftentlichen \nSchiffe,  in  gesitteter  Gesellschaft,  da  die  Italiener  sich \nvoreinander  in  acht  nehmen,  ist  anständig  und  ange- \nnehm. Die  Ufer  sind  mit  Gärten  und  Lusthäusern  ge- \nschmückt; kleine  Ortschaften  treten  bis  ans  Wasser,  teil- \nweise geht  die  belebte  Landstraße  daran  hin.  Da  man \nschleusenweis  den  Fluß  hinabsteigt,  gibt  es  öfters  einen \nkleinen  Aufhalt,  den  man  benutzen  kann,  sich  auf  dem \nLande  umzusehen  und  die  reichlich  angebotenen  Früchte \nzu  genießen.  Nun  steigt  man  wieder  ein  und  bewegt \nsich  durch  eine  bewegte  Welt  voll  Fruchtbarkeit  und \nLeben. \n\nZu  so  viel  abwechselnden  Bildern  und  Gestalten  gesellte \nsich  noch  eine  Erscheinung,  die,  obgleich  aus  Deutsch- \nland abstammend,  doch  hier  ganz  eigentlich  an  ihrem \nPlatze  war,  zwei  Pilger  nämlich,  die  ersten,  die  ich  in \nder  Nähe  sah.  Sie  haben  das  Recht,  mit  dieser  öftent- \nlichen Gelegenheit  umsonst  weiter  gebracht  zu  werden; \nallein  weil  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  ihre  Nähe  scheut,  so \nsitzen  sie  nicht  mit  in  dem  bedeckten  Räume,  sondern \nhinten  bei  dem  Steuermann.  Als  eine  in  der  gegen- \nwärtigen Zeit  seltene  Erscheinung  wurden  sie  angestaunt \nund,  weil  früher  unter  dieser  Hülle  manch  Gesindel  um- \nhertrieb, wenig  geachtet.  Als  ich  vernahm,  daß  es  Deut- \nsche seien,  keiner  andern  Sprache  mächtig,  gesellte  ich \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  69 \n\nmich  zu  ihnen  und  vernahm,  daß  sie  aus  dem  Paderborni- \nschen herstammten.  Beides  waren  Männer  schon  über \nfünfzig,  von  dunkler,  aber  gutmütiger  Physiognomie.  Sie \nhatten  vor  allem  das  Grab  der  heiligen  drei  Könige  zu \nCöln  besucht,  waren  sodann  durch  Deutschland  gezogen \nund  nun  auf  dem  Wege,  zusammen  bis  Rom  und  sodann \nins  obere  Italien  zurückzugehen,  da  denn  der  eine  wieder \nnach  Westfalen  zu  wandern,  der  andere  aber  noch  den \nheiligen  Jakob  zu  Compostell  zu  verehren  gedachte. \nIhre  Kleidung  war  die  bekannte,  doch  sahen  sie  aufge- \nschürzt viel  besser  aus,  als  wir  sie  in  langen  Taffetkleidern \nauf  unsern  Redouten  vorzustellen  pflegen.  Der  große \nKragen,  der  runde  Hut,  der  Stab  und  die  Muschel,  als \ndas  unschuldigste  Trinkgeschirr,  alles  hatte  seine  Be- \ndeutung, seinen  unmittelbaren  Nutzen;  die  Blechkapsel \nenthielt  ihre  Pässe.  Das  Merkwürdigste  aber  waren  ihre \nkleinen  rotsaffianen  Brieftaschen;  in  diesen  befand  sich \nalles  kleine  Geräte,  was  nur  irgend  einem  einfachen  Be- \ndürfnis abzuhelfen  geeignet  sein  mochte.  Sie  hatten  die- \nselben hervorgezogen,  indem  sie  an  ihren  Kleidern  etwas \nzu  flicken  fanden. \n\nDer  Steuermann,  höchst  zufrieden,  daß  er  einen  Dol- \nmetscher fand,  ließ  mich  verschiedene  Fragen  an  sie  tun; \ndadurch  vernahm  ich  manches  von  ihren  Ansichten,  be- \nsonders aber  von  ihrer  Reise.  Sie  beklagten  sich  bitter- \nlich über  ihre  Glaubensgenossen,  ja  Weltpriester  und \nKlostergeistliche.  Die  Frömmigkeit,  sagten  sie,  müsse \neine  sehr  seltene  Sache  sein,  weil  man  an  die  ihrige  nir- \ngends glauben  wolle,  sondern  sie  fast  durchaus,  ob  sie \ngleich  die  ihnen  vorgeschriebene  geistliche  Marschroute \nimd  die  bischöflichen  Pässe  vorgezeigt,  in  katholischen \nLanden  wie  Landstreicher  behandle.  Sie  erzählten  da- \ngegen mit  Rührung,  wie  gut  sie  von  den  Protestanten \naufgenommen  worden,  besonders  von  einem  Landgeist- \nlichen in  Schwaben,  vorzüglich  aber  von  seiner  Frau, \nwelche  den  einigermaßen  widerstrebenden  Mann  dahin \nvermocht,  daß  sie  ihnen  reichliche  Erquickung  zuteilen \ndürfen,  welche  ihnen  sehr  not  getan.  Ja  beim  Abschiede \nhabe  sie  ihnen  einen  Konventionstaler  geschenkt,   der \n\n\n70  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nihnen  sehr  zustatten  gekommen,  sobald  sie  das  katho- \nlische Gebiet  wieder  betreten.  Hierauf  sagte  der  eine \nmit  aller  Erhebung,  deren  er  fähig  war:  Wir  schließen \ndiese  Frau  aber  auch  täglich  in  unser  Gebet  ein  und  bit- \nten Gott,  daß  er  ihre  Augen  öflhe,  wie  er  ihr  Herz  für \nuns  geöffnet  hat,  daß  er  sie,  wenn  auch  spät,  aufnehme \nin  den  Schoß  der  alleinseligmachenden  Kirche;  und  so \nhoffen  wir  gewiß,  ihr  dereinst  im  Paradies  zu  begegnen. \nVon  diesem  allen  erklärte  ich,  was  nötig  und  nützlich \nwar,  auf  der  kleinen  Steige  sitzend,  die  auf  das  Verdeck \nführt,  dem  Steuermanne  und  einigen  andern  Personen, \ndie  sich  aus  der  Kajüte  in  den  engen  Raum  gedrängt \nhatten.  Den  Pilgern  wurden  einige  ärmliche  Erquickun- \ngen gereicht,  denn  der  Italiener  liebt  nicht  zu  geben.  Sie \nzogen  hierauf  kleine  geweihte  Zettel  hervor,  worauf  zu \nsehen  das  Bild  der  heiligen  drei  Könige,  nebst  lateini- \nschen Gebeten  zur  Verehrung.  Die  guten  Menschen  baten \nmich,  die  kleine  Gesellschaft  damit  zu  beschenken  und \nihr  den  hohen  Wert  dieser  Blätter  begreiflich  zu  machen. \nDieses  gelang  mir  auch  ganz  gut,  denn  als  die  beiden \nMänner  sehr  verlegen  schienen,  wie  sie  in  dem  großen \nVenedig  das  zur  Aufnahme  der  Pilger  bestimmte  Kloster \nausfinden  sollten,  so  versprach  der  gerührte  Steuermann, \nwenn  sie  landeten,  wollte  er  einem  Burschen  sogleich \neinen  Dreier  geben,  damit  er  sie  zu  jenem  entfernt  ge- \nlegenen Orte  geleitete.  Sie  würden  zwar,  setzte  er  ver- \ntraulich hinzu,  sie  würden  dort  wenig  Trost  finden:  die \nAnstalt,  sehr  groß  angelegt,  um  ich  weiß  nicht  wie  viel \nPilger  zu  fassen,  sei  gegenwärtig  ziemlich  zusammen- \ngegangen, und  die  Einkünfte  würden  eben  anders  ver- \nwendet. \n\nSo  unterhalten,  waren  wir  die  schöne  Brenta  herunter- \ngekommen, manchen  herrlichen  Garten,  manchen  herr- \nlichen Palast  hinter  uns  lassend,  wohlhabende,  belebte \nOrtschaften  an  der  Küste  mit  flüchtigem  Blick  beschauend. \nAls  wir  nun  in  die  Lagunen  einfuhren,  umschwärmten \nmehrere  Gondeln  sogleich  das  SchiÖ\".  Ein  Lombard,  in \nVenedig  wohl  bekannt,  forderte  mich  auf,  ihm  Gesell- \nschaft zu  leisten,  damit  wir  geschwinder  drinne  wären \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  71 \n\nund  der  Doganenqual  entgingen.  Einige,  die  uns  ab- \nhalten wollten,  wußte  er  mit  einem  mäßigen  Trinkgeld \nzu  beseitigen,  und  so  schwammen  wir,  bei  einem  heitern \nSonnenuntergang,  schnell  unserm  Ziel  entgegen. \n\nDen  2g.  Septet?iber,  Michaelistag  abends. \nVon  Venedig  ist  schon  viel  erzählt  und  gedruckt,  daß  ich \nmit  Beschreibung  nicht  umständlich  sein  will;  ich  sage \nnur,  wie  es  mir  entgegenkömmt.  Was  sich  mir  aber  vor \nallem  andern  aufdringt,  ist  abermals  das  Volk,  eine  große \nMasse,  ein  notwendiges  unwillkürliches  Dasein. \nDieses  Geschlecht  hat  sich  nicht  zum  Spaß  auf  diese  In- \nseln geflüchtet;  es  war  keine  Willkür,  welche  die  Fol- \ngenden trieb,  sich  mit  ihnen  zu  vereinigen:  die  Not  lehrte \nsie  ihre  Sicherheit  in  der  unvorteilhaftesten  Lage  suchen, \ndie  ihnen  nachher  so  vorteilhaft  ward  und  sie  klug  machte, \nals  noch  die  ganze  nördliche  Welt  im  Düstern  gefangen \nlag;  ihre  Vermehrung,  ihr  Reichtum  war  notwendige \nFolge.  Nun  drängten  sich  die  Wohnungen  enger  und \nenger,  Sand  und  Sumpf  wurden  durch  Felsen  ersetzt; \ndie  Häuser  suchten  die  Luft,  wie  Bäume,  die  geschlossen \nstehen:  sie  mußten  an  Höhe  zu  gewinnen  suchen,  was \nihnen  an  Breite  abging.  Auf  jede  Spanne  des  Bodens \ngeizig  und  gleich  anfangs  in  enge  Räume  gedrängt,  ließen \nsie  zu  Gassen  nicht  mehr  Breite,  als  nötig  war,  eine \nHausreihe  von  der  gegenüberstehenden  zu  trennen  und \ndem  Bürger  notdürftige  Durchgänge  zu  erhalten.  Übri- \ngens war  ihnen  das  Wasser  statt  Straße,  Platz  und  Spa- \nziergang. Der  Venezianer  mußte  eine  neue  Art  von  Ge- \nschöpf werden,  wie  man  denn  auch  Venedig  nur  mit  sich \nselbst  vergleichen  kann.  Der  große  schlangenförmig  ge- \nwundene Kanal  weicht  keiner  Straße  in  der  Welt,  dem \nRaum  vor  dem  Markusplatze  kann  wohl  nichts  an  die \nSeite  gesetzt  werden:  ich  meine  den  großen  Wasserspiegel, \nder  diesseits  von  dem  eigentlichen  Venedig  im  halben \nMond  umfaßt  wird.  Über  der  Wasserfläche  sieht  man \nlinks  die  Insel  San  Giorgio  Maggiore,  etwas  weiter  rechts \ndie  Giudecca  und  ihren  Kanal,  noch  weiter  rechts  die \nDogane  und  die  Einfahrt  in  den  Canal  Grande,  wo  uns \n\n\n72  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngleich  ein  paar  ungeheure  Marmortempel  entgegenleuch- \nten. Dies  sind  mit  wenigen  Zügen  die  Hauptgegenstände, \ndie  uns  in  die  Augen  fallen,  wenn  wir  zwischen  den  zwei \nSäulen  des  Markusplatzes  hervortreten.  Die  sämtlichen \nAus-  und  Ansichten  sind  so  oft  in  Kupfer  gestochen,  daß \ndie  Freunde  davon  sich  gar  leicht  einen  anschaulichen \nBegriff  machen  können. \n\nNach  Tische  eilte  ich,  mir  erst  einen  Eindruck  des  Gan- \nzen zu  versichern,  und  warf  mich,  ohne  Begleiter,  nur \ndie  Himmelsgegenden  merkend,  ins  Labyrinth  der  Stadt, \nwelche,  obgleich  durchaus  von  Kanälen  und  Kanälchen \ndurchschnitten,  durch  Brücken  und  Brückchen  wieder  zu- \nsammenhängt. Die  Enge  und  Gedrängtheit  des  Ganzen \ndenkt  man  nicht,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben.  Gewöhnlich \nkann  man  die  Breite  der  Gasse  mit  ausgereckten  Armen \nentweder  ganz  oder  beinahe  messen,  in  den  engsten  stößt \nman  schon  mit  den  Ellbogen  an,  wenn  man  die  Hände \nin  die  Seite  stemmt;  es  gibt  wohl  breitere,  auch  hie  und \nda  ein  Plätzchen,  verhältnismäßig  aber  kann  alles  enge \ngenannt  werden. \n\nIch  fand  leicht  den  großen  Kanal  und  die  Hauptbrücke \nRialto;  sie  besteht  aus  einem  einzigen  Bogen  von  weißem \nMarmor.  Von  oben  herunter  ist  es  eine  große  Ansicht: \nder  Kanal  gesäet  voll  Schiffe,  die  alles  Bedürfnis  vom \nfesten  Lande  herbeiführen  und  hier  hauptsächlich  anlegen \nund  ausladen;  dazwischen  wimmelt  es  von  Gondeln.  Be- \nsonders heute,  als  am  Michaelisfeste,  gab  es  einen  An- \nblick wunderschön  lebendig;  doch  um  diesen  einiger- \nmaßen darzustellen,  muß  ich  etwas  weiter  ausholen. \nDie  beiden  Hauptteile  von  Venedig,  welche  der  große \nKanal  trennt,  werden  durch  die  einzige  Brücke  Rialto \nmiteinander  verbunden,  doch  ist  auch  für  mehrere  Kom- \nmunikation gesorgt,  welche,  in  offenen  Barken,  an  be- \nstimmten Überfahrtspunkten  geschieht.  Nun  sah  es  heute \nsehr  gut  aus,  als  die  wohlgekleideten,  doch  mit  einem \nschwarzen  Schleier  bedeckten  Frauen  sich,  viele  zusam- \nmen, übersetzen  ließen,  um  zu  der  Kirche  des  gefeierten \nErzengels  zu  gelangen.  Ich  verließ  die  Brücke  und  be- \ngab  mich  an  einen  solchen  Überfahrtspunkt,  die  Aus- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  73 \n\nsteigenden  genau  zu  betrachten.  Ich  habe  sehr  schöne \nGesichter  und  Gestalten  darunter  gefunden. \nNachdem  ich  müde  geworden,  setzte  ich  mich  in  eine \nGondel,  die  engen  Gassen  verlassend,  und  fuhr,  mir  das  ent- \ngegengesetzte Schauspiel  zu  bereiten,  den  nördlichen  Teil \ndes  großen  Kanals  durch,  um  die  Insel  der  heiligen  Klara, \nin  die  Lagunen,  den  Kanal  der  Giudecca  herein,  bis  ge- \ngen den  Markusplatz,  und  war  nun  auf  einmal  ein  Mit- \nherr des  Adriatischen  Meeres,  wie  jeder  Venezianer  sich \nfühlt,  wenn  er  sich  in  seine  Gondel  legt.  Ich  gedachte  dabei \nmeines  guten  Vaters  in  Ehren,  der  nichts  Besseres  wußte, \nals  von  diesen  Dingen  zu  erzählen.  Wird  mir's  nicht  auch \nso  gehen?  Alles,  was  mich  umgibt,  ist  würdig,  ein  großes \nrespektables  Werk  versammelter  Menschenkraft,  ein  herr- \nliches Monument,  nicht  eines  Gebieters,  sondern  eines \nVolks.  Und  wenn  auch  ihre  Lagunen  sich  nach  und  nach \nausfüllen,  böse  Dünste  über  dem  Sumpfe  schweben,  ihr \nHandel  geschwächt,  ihre  Macht  gesunken  ist,  so  wird \ndie  ganze  Anlage  der  Republik  und  ihr  Wesen  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  dem  Beobachter  weniger  ehrwürdig \nsein.  Sie  unterliegt  der  Zeit,  wie  alles,  was  ein  erschei- \nnendes Dasein  hat. \n\nDen  30.  September. \nGegen  Abend  verlief  ich  mich  wieder,  ohne  Führer,  in \ndie  entferntesten  Quartiere  der  Stadt.  Die  hiesigen  Brük- \nken  sind  alle  mit  Treppen  angelegt,  damit  Gondeln  und \nauch  wohl  größere  Schiffe  bequem  unter  den  Bogen  hin- \nfahren. Ich  suchte  mich  in  und  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \nzu  finden,  ohne  irgend  jemand  zu  fragen,  mich  abermals \nnur  nach  der  Himmelsgegend  richtend.  Man  entwirrt \nsich  wohl  endlich,  aber  es  ist  ein  unglaubliches  Gehecke \nineinander,  und  meine  Manier,  sich  recht  sinnlich  da- \nvon zu  überzeugen,  die  beste.  Auch  habe  ich  mir,  bis \nan  die  letzte  bewohnte  Spitze,  der  Einwohner  Betragen, \nLebensart,  Sitte  und  Wesen  gemerkt;  in  jedem  Quartiere \nsind  sie  anders  beschaffen.  Du  lieber  Gott!  was  doch \nder  Mensch  für  ein  armes,  gutes  Tier  ist! \nSehr  viele  Häuserchen  stehen  unmittelbar  in  den  Ka- \n\n\n74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nnälen;  doch  gibt  es  hie  und  da  schön  gepflasterte  Stein- \ndämnie,  auf  denen  man  zwischen  Wasser,  Kirchen  und \nPalästen  gar  angenehm  hin  und  wieder  spaziert.  Lustig \nund  erfreuhch  ist  der  lange  Steindamm  an  der  nördlichen \nSeite,  von  welchem  die  Inseln,  besonders  Murano,  das \nVenedig  im  kleinen,  geschaut  werden.  Die  Lagunen  da- \nzwischen sind  von  vielen  Gondeln  belebt. \n\nAbends. \nHeute  habe  ich  abermals  meinen  Begriff  von  Venedig \nerweitert,  indem  ich  mir  den  Plan  verschaffte.  Als  ich \nihn  einigermaßen  studiert,  bestieg  ich  den  Markusturm, \nwo  sich  dem  Auge  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  darstellt.  Es \nwar  um  Mittag  und  heller  Sonnenschein,  daß  ich  ohne \nPerspektiv  Nähen  und  Fernen  genau  erkennen  konnte. \nDie  Flut  bedeckte  die  Lagunen,  und  als  ich  den  Blick \nnach  dem  sogenannten  Lido  wandte — es  ist  ein  schmaler \nErdstreif,  der  die  Lagunen  schließt — sah  ich  zum  ersten- \nmal das  Meer  und  einige  Segel,  darauf.  In  den  Lagunen \nselbst  liegen  Galeeren  und  Fregatten,  die  zum  Ritter  Emo \nstoßen  sollten,  der  den  Algierern  den  Krieg  macht,  die \naber  wegen  ungünstiger  Winde  liegen  bleiben.  Die  Padu- \nanischen  und  Vicentinischen  Berge  und  das  Tiroler  Ge- \nbirge schließen,  zwischen  Abend  und  Mitternacht,  das \nBild  ganz  trefflich  schön. \n\nDen  I.  Oktober. \nIch  ging  und  besah  mir  die  Stadt  in  mancherlei  Rück- \nsichten, und  da  es  eben  Sonntag  war,  fiel  mir  die  große \nUnreinlichkeit  der  Straßen  auf,  worüber  ich  meine  Be- \ntrachtungen anstellen  mußte.  Es  ist  wohl  eine  Art  von \nPolizei  in  diesem  Artikel:  die  Leute  schieben  den  Keh- \nricht in  die  Ecken;  auch  sehe  ich  große  Schiffe  hin  und \nwieder  fahren,  die  an  manchen  Orten  stille  liegen  und \ndas  Kehricht  mitnehmen,  Leute  von  den  Inseln  umher, \nwelche  des  Düngers  bedürfen;  aber  es  ist  in  diesen  An- \nstalten weder  Folge  noch  Strenge  imd  desto  unverzeih- \nlicher die  Unreinlichkeit  der  Stadt,  da  sie  ganz  zur  Rein- \nlichkeit angelegt  worden,  so  gut  als  irgend  eine  hol- \nländische. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  75 \n\nAlle  Straßen  sind  geplattet,  selbst  die  entferntesten \nQuartiere  wenigstens  mit  Backsteinen  auf  der  hohen \nKante  ausgesetzt,  wo  es  nötig,  in  der  Mitte  ein  wenig \nerhaben,  an  der  Seite  Vertiefungen,  das  Wasser  aufzu- \nfassen und  in  bedeckte  Kanäle  zu  leiten.  Noch  andere \narchitektonische  Vorrichtungen  der  ersten  wohlüberdach- \nten Anlage  zeugen  von  der  Absicht  trefflicher  Baumeister, \nVenedig  zu  der  reinsten  Stadt  zu  machen,  wie  sie  die \nsonderbarste  ist.  Ich  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  gleich \nim  Spaziergehen  eine  Anordnung  deshalb  zu  entwerfen \nund  einem  Polizeivorsteher,  dem  es  Ernst  wäre,  in  Ge- \ndanken vorzuarbeiten.  So  hat  man  immer  Trieb  und  Lust, \nvor  fremden  Türen  zu  kehren. \n\nDen  2.  Oktober. \nVor  allem  eilte  ich  in  die  Caritä:  ich  hatte  in  des  Pal- \nladio  Werken  gefunden,  daß  er  hier  ein  Klostergebäude \nangegeben,  in  welchem  er  die  Privatwohnung  der  reichen \nund  gastfreien  Alten  darzustellen  gedachte.  Der  sowohl \nim  ganzen  als  in  seinen  einzelnen  Teilen  trefflich  ge- \nzeichnete Plan  machte  mir  unendliche  Freude,  und  ich \nhofi'te  ein  Wunderwerk  zu  finden;  aber  ach!  es  ist  kaum \nder  zehnte  Teil  ausgeführt;  doch  auch  dieser  Teil  seines \nhimmlischen  Genius  würdig,  eine  Vollkommenheit  in  der \nAnlage  und  eine  Genauigkeit  in  der  Ausführung,  die  ich \nnoch  nicht  kannte.  Jahrelang  sollte  man  in  Betrachtung \nso  eines  Werks  zubringen.  Mich  dünkt,  ich  habe  nichts \nHöheres,  nichts  Vollkommneres  gesehen,  und  glaube,  daß \nich  mich  nicht  irre.  Denke  man  sich  aber  auch  den \ntrefflichen  Künstler,  mit  dem  Innern  Sinn  fürs  Große \nund  Gefällige  geboren,  der  erst  mit  unglaublicher  Mühe \nsich  an  den  Alten  heranbildet,  um  sie  alsdann  durch  sich \nwiederherzustellen.  Dieser  findet  Gelegenheit,  einen  Lieb- \nlingsgedanken auszuführen,  ein  Kloster,  so  vielen  Mön- \nchen zur  Wohnung,  so  vielen  Fremden  zur  Herberge \nbestimmt,  nach  der  Form  eines  antiken  Privatgebäudes \naufzurichten. \n\nDie  Kirche  stand  schon;  aus  ihr  tritt  man  in  ein  Atrium \nvon  korinthischen  Säulen,  man  ist  entzückt  und  vergißt \n\n\n76  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  einmal  alles  Pfaffentum.  An  der  einen  Seite  findet \nman  die  Sakristei,  an  der  andern  ein  Kapitelzimmer, \ndaneben  die  schönste  Wendeltreppe  von  der  Welt,  mit \noffener  weiter  Spindel,  die  steinernen  Stufen  in  die  Wand \ngemauert  und  so  geschichtet,  daß  eine  die  andere  trägt; \nman  wird  nicht  müde,  sie  auf  und  ab  zu  steigen;  wie \nschön  sie  geraten  sei,  kann  man  daraus  abnehmen,  daß \nsie  Palladio  selbst  für  wohlgeraten  angibt.  Aus  dem  Vor- \nhof tritt  man  in  den  innern  großen  Hof.  Von  dem  Ge- \nbäude, das  ihn  umgeben  sollte,  ist  leider  nur  die  linke \nSeite  aufgeführt,  drei  Säulenordnungen  übereinander,  auf \nder  Erde  Hallen,  im  ersten  Stock  ein  Bogengang  vor  den \nZellen  hin,  der  obere  Stock  Mauer  mit  Fenstern.  Doch \ndiese  Beschreibung  muß  durch  den  Anblick  der  Risse  ge- \nstärkt werden.  Nun  ein  Wort  von  der  Ausführung. \nNur  die  Häupter  und  Füße  der  Säulen  und  die  Schluß- \nsteine der  Bogen  sind  von  gehauenem  Stein,  das  übrige \nalles,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  von  Backsteinen,  sondern  von \ngebranntem  Ton.  Solche  Ziegeln  kenne  ich  gar  nicht. \nFries  und  Karnies  sind  auch  daraus,  die  Glieder  der  Bo- \ngen gleichfalls,  alles  teilweise  gebrannt  und  das  Gebäude \nzuletzt  nur  mit  wenig  Kalk  zusammengesetzt.  Es  steht \nwie  aus  einem  Guß.  'Wäre  das  Ganze  fertig  geworden \nund  man  sähe  es  reinlich  abgerieben  und  gefärbt,  es \nmüßte  ein  himmlischer  Anblick  sein. \nJedoch  die  Anlage  war  zu  groß,  wie  bei  so  manchem  Gebäude \nder  neuern  Zeit.  Der  Künstler  hatte  nicht  nur  vorausge- \nsetzt, daß  man  das  jetzige  Kloster  abreißen,  sondern  auch \nanstoßende  Nachbarshäuser  kaufen  werde;  und  da  mögen \nGeld  und  Lust  ausgegangen  sein.  Du  liebes  Schicksal,  das \ndu  so  manche  Dummheit  begünstigt  und  verewigt  hast, \nwarum  ließest  du  dieses  Werk  nicht  zustande  kommen! \n\nDen  s-  Oktober. \nDie  Kirche  II  Redentore,  ein  schönes  großes  Werk  von \nPalladio,  die  Fassade  lobenswürdiger  als  die  von  San \nGiorgio.  Diese  mehrmals  in  Kupfer  gestochenen  Werke \nmüßte  man  vor  sich  sehen,  um  das  Gesagte  verdeutlichen \nzu  können.    Hier  nur  wenige  Worte. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  77 \n\nPalladio  war  durchaus  von  der  Existenz  der  Alten  durch- \ndrungen und  fühlte  die  Kleinheit  und  Enge  seiner  Zeit \nwie  ein  großer  Mensch,  der  sich  nicht  hingeben,  sondern \ndas  übrige  so  viel  als  möglich  nach  seinen  edlen  Be- \ngrifien  umbilden  will.  Er  war  unzufrieden,  wie  ich  aus \ngelinder  Wendung  seines  Buches  schließe,  daß  man  bei \nchristlichen  Kirchen  nach  der  Form  der  alten  Basiliken \nzu  bauen  fortfahre:  er  suchte  deshalb  seine  heiligen  Ge- \nbäude der  alten  Tempelform  zu  nähern;  daher  ent- \nstanden gewisse  Unschicklichkeiten,  die  mir  bei  II  Reden- \ntore glücklich  beseitigt,  bei  San  Giorgio  aber  zu  auffallend \nerscheinen.  Volkmann  sagt  etwas  davon,  trifft  aber  den \nNagel  nicht  auf  den  Kopf. \n\nInwendig  ist  II  Redentore  gleichfalls  köstlich,  alles,  auch \ndie  Zeichnung  der  Altäre,  von  Palladio;  leider  die  Ni- \nschen, die  mit  Statuen  ausgefüllt  werden  sollten,  prangen \nmit  flachen,  ausgeschnittenen,  gemalten  Brettfiguren. \n\nDem  heiligen  Franziskus  zu  Ehren  hatten  die  Patres \nKapuziner  einen  Seitenaltar  mächtig  ausgeputzt:  man \nsah  nichts  von  Stein  als  die  korinthischen  Kapitale; \nalles  übrige  schien  mit  einer  geschmackvollen  prächtigen \nStickerei,  nach  Art  der  Arabesken,  überzogen,  und  zwar \nso  artig,  als  man  nur  etwas  zu  sehen  wünschte.  Beson- \nders wunderte  ich  mich  über  die  breiten,  goldgestickten \nRanken  und  Laubwerke.  Ich  ging  näher  und  fand  einen \nrecht  hübschen  Betrug.  Alles,  was  ich  für  Gold  gehalten \nhatte^  war  breitgedrücktes  Stroh,  nach  schönen  Zeich- \nnungen auf  Papier  geklebt,  der  Grund  mit  lebhaften  Far- \nben angestrichen,  und  das  so  mannigfaltig  und  ge- \nschmackvoll, daß  dieser  Spaß,  dessen  Material  gar  nichts \nwert  war  und  der  wahrscheinlich  im  Kloster  selbst  aus- \ngeführt wurde,  mehrere  tausend  Taler  müßte  gekostet \nhaben,  wenn  er  echt  hätte  sein  sollen.  Man  könnte  es \ngelegentlich  wohl  nachahmen. \n\nAuf  einem  Uferdamme,  im  Angesicht  des  Wassers,  be- \nmerkte ich  schon  einigemal  einen  geringen  Kerl,  welcher \neiner  größern  oder  kleinern  Anzahl  von  Zuhörern  im \nvenezianischen  Dialekt   Geschichten  erzählte;  ich  kann \n\n\n78  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nleider  nichts  davon  verstehen;  es  lacht  aber  kein  Mensch, \nnur  selten  lächelt  das  Auditorium,  das  meist  aus  der  ganz \nniedern  Klasse  besteht.  Auch  hat  der  Mann  nichts  Auf- \nfallendes noch  Lächerliches  in  seiner  Art,  vielmehr  et- \nwas sehr  Gesetztes,  zugleich  eine  bewundrungswürdige \nMannigfaltigkeit  und  Präzision,  welche  auf  Kunst  und \nNachdenken  hinwiesen,  in  seinen  Gebärden. \n\nDen  Plan  in  der  Hand,  suchte  ich  mich  durch  die  wunder- \nlichsten Irrgänge  bis  zur  Kirche  der  Mendicanti  zu  finden. \nHier  ist  das  Konservatorium,  welches  gegenwärtig  den \nmeisten  Beifall  hat.  Die  Frauenzimmer  fühj-ten  ein  Ora- \ntorium hinter  dem  Gitter  auf,  die  Kirche  war  voll  Zu- \nhörer, die  Musik  sehr  schön,  und  herrliche  Stimmen.  Ein \nAlt  sang  den  König  Saul,  die  Hauptperson  des  Gedichtes. \nVon  einer  solchen  Stimme  hatte  ich  gar  keinen  Begriff; \neinige  Stellen  der  Musik  waren  unendlich  schön,  der  Text \nvollkommen  singbar,  so  italienisch  Latein,  daß  man  an \nmanchen  Stellen  lachen  muß;  die  Musik  aber  findet  hier \nein  weites  Feld. \n\nEs  wäre  ein  trefflicher  Genuß  gewesen,  wenn  nicht  der \nvermaledeite  Kapellmeister  den  Takt  mit  einer  Rolle \nNoten  wider  das  Gitter  und  so  unverschämt  geklappt \nhätte,  als  habe  er  mit  Schuljungen  zu  tun,  die  er  eben \nunterrichtete;  und  die  Mädchen  hatten  das  Stück  oft \nwiederholt,  sein  Klatschen  war  ganz  unnötig  und  zerstörte \nallen  Eindruck,  nicht  anders  als  wenn  einer,  um  uns  eine \nschöne  Statue  begreiflich  zu  machen,  ihr  Scharlachläpp- \nchen auf  die  Gelenke  klebte.  Der  fremde  Schall  hebt  alle \nHarmonie  auf.  Das  ist  nun  ein  Musiker,  und  er  hört  es  nicht, \noder  er  will  vielmehr,  daß  man  seine  Gegenwart  durch \neine  Unschicklichkeit  vernehmen  soll,  da  es  besser  wäre, \ner  ließe  seinen  Wert  an  der  Vollkommenheit  der  Ausführung \nerraten.  Ich  weiß,  die  Franzosen  haben  es  an  der  Art; \nden  Italienern  hätte  ich  es  nicht  zugetraut,  und  das  Publi- \nkum scheint  daran  gewöhnt.  Es  ist  nicht  das  einzige  Mal, \ndaß  es  sich  einbilden  läßt,  das  gerade  gehöre  zum  Genuß, \nwas  den  Genuß  verdirbt. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  79 \n\nGestern  abend  Oper  zu  St.  Moses  (denn  die  Theater  haben \nihren  Namen  von  der  Kirche,  der  sie  am  nächsten  liegen); \nnicht  recht  erfreuUch!  Es  fehlt  dem  Poem,  der  Musik, \nden  Sängern  eine  innere  Energie,  welche  allein  eine  solche \nDarstellung  auf  den  höchsten  Punkt  treiben  kann.  Man \nkonnte  von  keinem  Teile  sagen,  er  sei  schlecht;  aber  nur \ndie  zwei  Frauen  ließen  sich's  angelegen  sein,  nicht  so- \nwohl gut  zu  agieren  als  sich  zu  produzieren  und  zu  ge- \nfallen. Das  ist  denn  immer  etwas.  Es  sind  zwei  schöne \nFiguren,  gute  Stimmen,  artige,  muntere,  gätliche  Per- \nsönchen.  Unter  den  Männern  dagegen  keine  Spur  von \ninnerer  Gewalt  und  Lust,  dem  Publikum  etwas  aufzuheften, \nsowie  keine  entschieden  glänzende  Stimme. \nDas  Ballett,  von  elender  Erfindung,  ward  im  ganzen  aus- \ngepfififen,  einige  treöliche  Springer  und  Springerinnen \njedoch,  welche  letztere  sich  es  zur  Pflicht  rechneten,  die \nZuschauer  mit  jedem  schönen  Teil  ihres  Körpers  bekannt \nzu  machen,  wurden  weidlich  beklatscht. \n\nHeute  dagegen  sah  ich  eine  andere  Komödie,  die  mich \nmehr  gefreut  hat.  Im  herzoglichen  Palast  hörte  ich  eine \nRechtssache  öfientlich  verhandeln;  sie  war  wichtig  und \nzu  meinem  Glück  in  den  Ferien  vorgenommen.  Der  eine \nAdvokat  war  aUes,  was  ein  übertriebener  BufFo  nur  sein \nsollte.  Figur  dick,  kurz,  doch  beweglich,  ein  ungeheuer \nvorspringendes  Profil,  eine  Stimme  wie  Erz  und  eine \nHeftigkeit,  als  wenn  es  ihm  aus  tiefstem  Grunde  des \nHerzens  Ernst  wäre,  was  er  sagte.  Ich  nenne  dies  eine \nKomödie,  weil  alles  wahrscheinlich  schon  fertig  ist,  wenn \ndiese  öffentliche  Darstellung  geschieht:  die  Richter  wissen, \nwas  sie  sprechen  sollen,  und  die  Partei  weiß,  was  sie  zu \nerwarten  hat.  Indessen  gefällt  mir  diese  Art  unendlich \nbesser  als  unsere  Stuben-  und  Kanzleihockereien.  Und \nnun  von  den  Umständen,  und  wie  artig,  ohne  Prunk,  wie \nnatürlich  alles  zugeht,  will  ich  suchen  einen  Begriff  zu \ngeben. \n\nIn  einem  geräumigen  Saal  des  Palastes  saßen  an  der  einen \nSeite  die  Richter  im  Halbzirkel.  Gegen  ihnen  über,  auf \neinem  Katheder,  der  mehrere  Personen  nebeneinander \n\n\n8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfassen  konnte,  die  Advokaten  beider  Parteien;  unmittel- \nbar vor  demselben,  auf  ei7:er  Bank,  Kläger  und  Beklagte \nin  eigner  Person.  Der  Advokat  des  Klägers  war  von  dem \nKatheder  herabgestiegen,  denn  die  heutige  Sitzung  war \nzu  keiner  Kontrovers  bestimmt.  Die  sämtlichen  Doku- \nmente für  und  wider,  obgleich  schon  gedruckt,  sollten \nvorgelesen  werden. \n\nEin  hagerer  Schreiber,  in  schwarzem  kümmerlichen  Rocke, \nein  dickes  Heft  in  der  Hand,  bereitete  sich,  die  Pflicht \ndes  Lesenden  zu  erfüllen.  Von  Zuschauern  und  Zuhörern \nwar  übrigens  der  Saal  gedrängt  voll.  Die  Rechtsfrage \nselbst  sowie  die  Personen,  welche  sie  betraf,  mußten  den \nVenezianern  höchst  bedeutend  scheinen. \nFideikommisse  haben  in  diesem  Staat  die  entschiedenste \nGunst:  ein  Besitztum,  welchem  einmal  dieser  Charakter \naufgeprägt  ist,  behält  ihn  für  ewige  Zeiten;  es  mag  durch \nirgend  eine  Wendung  oder  Umstand  vor  mehrern  hundert \nJahren  veräußert  worden,  durch  viele  Hände  gegangen \nsein,  zuletzt,  wenn  die  Sache  zur  Sprache  kommt,  be- \nhalten die  Nachkommen  der  ersten  Familie  recht,  und \ndie  Güter  müssen  herausgegeben  werden. \nDiesmal  war  der  Streit  höchst  wichtig,  denn  die  Klage \nging  gegen  den  Doge  selbst  oder  vielmehr  gegen  seine \nGemahlin,  welche  denn  auch  in  Person  auf  dem  Bänkchen, \nvom  Kläger  nur  durch  einen  kleinen  Zwischenraum  ge- \ntrennt, in  ihren  Zendal  gehüllt  dasaß.  Eine  Dame  von \ngewissem  Alter,  edlem  Körperbau,  wohlgebildetem  Ge- \nsicht, auf  welchem  ernste,  ja  wenn  man  will  etwas  ver- \ndrießliche Züge  zu  sehen  waren.  Die  Venezianer  bildeten \nsich  viel  darauf  ein,  daß  die  Fürstin,  in  ilirera  eignen \nPalast,  vor  dem  Gericht  und  ihnen  erscheinen  müsse. \nDer  Schreiber  fing  zu  lesen  an,  und  nun  ward  mir  erst \ndeutlich,  was  ein  im  Angesicht  der  Richter,  unfern  des \nKatheders  der  Advokaten,  hinter  einem  kleinen  Tische \nauf  einem  niedern  Schemel  sitzendes  Männchen,  besonders \naber  die  Sanduhr  bedeute,  die  er  vor  sich  niedergelegt \nhatte.  Solange  nämlich  der  Schreiber  liest,  so  lange \nläuft  die  Zeit  nicht;  dem  Advokaten  aber,  wenn  er  dabei \nsprechen  will,  ist  nur  im  ganzen  eine  gewisse  Frist  ge- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  81 \n\ngönnt.  Der  Schreiber  liest,  die  Uhr  liegt,  das  Männchen \nhat  die  Hand  daran.  Tut  der  Advokat  den  Mund  auf,  so \nsteht  auch  die  Uhr  schon  in  der  Höhe,  die  sich  sogleich \nniedersenkt,  sobald  er  schweigt.  Hier  ist  nun  die  große \nKunst,  in  den  Fluß  der  Vorlesung  hineinzureden,  flüchtige \nBemerkungen  zu  machen,  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  erregen  und \nzu  fordern.  Nun  kommt  der  kleine  Saturn  in  die  größte \nVerlegenheit.  Er  ist  genötigt,  den  horizontalen  und  ver- \ntikalen Stand  der  Uhr  jeden  Augenblick  zu  verändern,  er \nbefindet  sich  im  Fall  der  bösen  Geister  im  Puppenspiel, \ndie  auf  das  schnell  wechselnde  Berlicke!  Berlocke!  des \nmutwilligen  Hanswursts  nicht  wissen,  wie  sie  gehen  oder \nkommen  sollen. \n\nWer  in  Kanzleien  hat  kollationieren  hören,  kann  sich  eine \nVorstellung  von  dieser  Vorlesung  machen,  schnell,  ein- \ntönig, aber  doch  artikuliert  und  deutlich  genug.  Der \nkunstreiche  Advokat  weiß  nun  durch  Scherze  die  Lange- \nweile zu  unterbrechen,  und  das  Publikum  ergötzt  sich  an \nseinen  Spaßen  in  ganz  unmäßigem  Gelächter.  Eines \nScherzes  muß  ich  gedenken,  des  auffallendsten  unter \ndenen,  die  ich  verstand.  Der  Vorleser  rezitierte  soeben \nein  Dokument,  wodurch  einer  jener  unrechtmäßig  ge- \nachteten Besitzer  über  die  fraglichen  Güter  disponierte. \nDer  Advokat  hieß  ihn  langsamer  lesen,  und  als  er  die \nWorte  deutlich  aussprach:  Ich  schenke^  ich  vermache^  fuhr \nder  Redner  heftig  auf  den  Schreiber  los  und  rief:  Was \nwillst  du  schenken?  was  vermachen?  du  armer  ausge- \nhungerter Teufel!  Gehört  dir  doch  gar  nichts  in  der  Welt \nan.  Doch,  fuhr  er  fort,  indem  er  sich  zu  besinnen  schien, \nwar  doch  jener  erlauchte  Besitzer  in  eben  dem  Fall,  er \nwollte  schenken,  wollte  vermachen,  was  ihm  so  wenig \ngehörte  als  dir.  Ein  unendlich  Gelächter  schlug  auf,  doch \nsogleich  nahm  die  Sanduhr* die  horizontale  Lage  wieder \nan.  Der  Vorleser  summte  fort,  machte  dem  Advokaten  ein \nflämisch  Gesicht;  doch  das  sind  alles  verabredete  Spaße. \n\nDen  4.  Oktober. \nGestern  war  ich  in  der  Komödie,  Theater  St.  Lukas,  die \nmir  viel  Freude  gemacht  hat:  ich  sah  ein  extemporiertes \n\nGOETHE  IV  6 \n\n\n82  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nStück  in  Masken,  mit  viel  Naturell,  Energie  und  Bravour \naufgeführt.  Freilich  sind  sie  nicht  alle  gleich;  der  Pan- \ntalon  sehr  brav,  die  eine  Frau,  stark  und  wohlgebaut, \nkeine  außerordentliche  Schauspielerin,  spricht  exzellent \nund  weiß  sich  zu  betragen.  Ein  tolles  Sujet,  demjenigen \nähnlich,  das  bei  uns  unter  dem  Titel  ''Der  Verschlag''  be- \nhandelt ist.  Mit  unglaublicher  Abwechslung  unterhielt  es \nmehr  als  drei  Stunden.  Doch  ist  auch  hier  das  Volk \nwieder  die  Base,  worauf  dies  alles  ruht:  die  Zuschauer \nspielen  mit,  und  die  Menge  verschmilzt  mit  dem  Theater \nin  ein  Ganzes.  Den  Tag  über  auf  dem  Platz  und  am \nUfer,  auf  den  Gondeln  und  im  Palast,  der  Käufer  und \nVerkäufer,  der  Bettler,  der  Schiffer,  die  Nachbarin,  der \nAdvokat  und  sein  Gegner,  alles  lebt  und  treibt  und  läßt \nsich  es  angelegen  sein,  spricht  und  beteuert,  schreit  und \nbietet  aus,  singt  und  spielt,  flucht  und  lärmt.  Und  abends \ngehen  sie  ins  Theater  und  sehen  und  hören  das  Leben \nihres  Tages,  künstlich  zusammengestellt,  artiger  aufge- \nstutzt, mit  Märchen  durchflochten,  durch  Masken  von  der \nWirklichkeit  abgerückt,  durch  Sitten  genähert.  Hierüber \nfreun  sie  sich  kindisch,  schreien  wieder,  klatschen  und \nlärmen.  Von  Nacht  zu  Nacht,  ja  von  Mitternacht  zu \nMitternacht  ist  immer  alles  eben  dasselbe. \nIch  habe  aber  auch  nicht  leicht  natürlicher  agieren  sehen \nals  jene  Masken,  so  wie  es  nur  bei  einem  ausgezeichnet \nglücklichen  Naturell  durch  längere  Übung  erreicht  werden \nkami. \n\nDa  ich  das  schreibe,  machen  sie  einen  gewaltigen  T^ärm \nauf  dem  Kanal  unter  meinem  Fenster,  und  Mitternacht  ist \nvorbei.  Sie  haben  im  Guten  und  Bösen  immer  etwas  zu- \nsammen. \n\nÖffentliche  Redner  habe  ich  nun  gehört:  drei  Kerls  auf \ndem  Platze  und  Ufersteindamme,  jeden  nach  seiner  Art \nGeschichten  erzählend,  sodann  zwei  Sachwalter,  zwei \nPrediger,  die  Schauspieler,  worunter  ich  besonders  den \nPantalon  rühmen  muß;  alle  diese  haben  etwas  Gemein- \nsames, sowohl  weil  sie  von  ein  und  derselben  Nation  sind, \ndie,  stets  öftentlich  lebend,  immer  in  leidenschaftlichem \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  83 \n\nSprechen  begriffen  ist,  als  auch  weil  sie  sich  untereinander \nnachahmen.  Hierzu  kommt  noch  eine  entschiedene  Ge- \nbärdensprache, mit  welcher  sie  die  Ausdrücke  ihrer  Inten- \ntionen, Gesinnungen  und  Empfindungen  begleiten. \nHeute  am  Fest  des  heiligen  Franziskus  war  ich  in  seiner \nKirche  alle  Vigne.  Des  Kapuziners  laute  Stimme  ward \nvon  dem  Geschrei  der  Verkäufer  vor  der  Kirche  wie  von \neiner  Antiphone  begleitet;  ich  stand  in  der  Kirchtüre \nzwischen  beiden,  und  es  war  wunderlich  genug  zu  hören. \n\nDen  j.  Oktober. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  im  Arsenal,  mir  immer  interessant \ngenug,  da  ich  noch  kein  Seewesen  kenne  und  hier  die \nuntere  Schule  besuchte:  denn  freilich  sieht  es  hier  nach \neiner  alten  Familie  aus,  die  sich  noch  rührt,  obgleich  die \nbeste  Zeit  der  Blüte  und  der  Früchte  vorüber  ist.  Da  ich \ndenn  auch  den  Handwerkern  nachgehe,  habe  ich  manches \nMerkwürdige  gesehen  und  ein  Schiff  von  vierundachtzig \nKanonen,  dessen  Gerippe  fertig  steht,  bestiegen. \nEin  gleiches  ist  vor  sechs  Monaten,  an  der  Riva  de' \nSchiavoni,  bis  aufs  Wasser  verbrannt;  die  Pulverkammer \nwar  nicht  sehr  gefüllt,  und  da  sie  sprang,  tat  es  keinen \ngroßen  Schaden.  Die  benachbarten  Häuser  büßten  ihre \nScheiben  ein. \n\nDas  schönste  Eichenholz,  aus  Istrien,  habe  ich  verarbeiten \nsehen  und  dabei  über  den  Wachstum  dieses  werten  Baumes \nmeine  stillen  Betrachtungen  angestellt.  Ich  kann  nicht \ngenug  sagen,  was  meine  sauer  erworbene  Kenntnis  natür- \nlicher Dinge,  die  doch  der  Mensch  zuletzt  als  Materialien \nbraucht  und  in  seinen  Nutzen  verwendet,  mir  überall  hilft, \num  mir  das  Verfahren  der  Künstler  und  Handwerker  zu \nerklären;  so  ist  mir  auch  die  Kenntnis  der  Gebirge  und \ndes  daraus  genommenen  Gesteins  ein  großer  Vorsprung \nin  der  Kunst. \n\nUm  mit  einem  Worte  den  Begriff  des  Bucentaur  auszu- \nsprechen, nenne  ich  ihn  eine  Prachtgaleere.  Der  ältere, \nvon  dem  wir  noch  Abbildungen  haben,  rechtfertigt  diese \n\n\n84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nBenennung  noch  mehr  als  der  gegenwärtige,  der  uns  durch \nseinen  Glanz  über  seinen  Ursprung  verblendet. \nIch  komme  immer  auf  mein  Altes  zurück.  Wenn  dem \nKünstler  ein  echter  Gegenstand  gegeben  ist,  so  kann  er \netwas  Echtes  leisten.  Hier  war  ihm  aufgetragen,  eine \nGaleere  zu  bilden,  die  wert  wäre,  die  Häupter  der  Repu- \nblik, am  feierlichsten  Tage,  zum  Sakrament  ihrer  herge- \nbrachten Meerherrschaft  zu  tragen,  und  diese  Aufgabe  ist \nfürtreft'lich  au.sgeführt.  Das  Schiff  ist  ganz  Zierat,  also \ndarf  man  nicht  sagen:  mit  Zierat  überladen;  ganz  ver- \nguldetes  Schnitzwerk,  sonst  zu  keinem  Gebrauch,  eine \nwahre  Monstranz,  um  dem  Volke  seine  Häupter  recht \nherrlich  zu  zeigen.  Wissen  wir  doch:  das  Volk,  wie  es \ngern  seine  Hüte  schmückt,  will  auch  seine  Obern  prächtig \nund  geputzt  sehen.  Dieses  Prunkschiff  ist  ein  rechtes  In- \nventarienstück,  woran  man  sehen  kann,  was  die  Vene- \nzianer waren  und  sich  zu  sein  dünkten. \n\nNac/its. \nIch  komme  noch  lachend  aus  der  Tragödie  und  muß \ndiesen  Scherz  gleich  auf  dem  Papier  befestigen.  Das \nStück  war  nicht  schlimm,  der  Verfasser  hatte  alle  tragischen \nMatadore  zusammengesteckt,  und  die  Schauspieler  hatten \ngut  spielen.  Die  meisten  Situationen  waren  bekannt, \neinige  neu  und  ganz  glücklich.  Zwei  Väter,  die  sich  hassen. \nSöhne  und  Töchter  aus  diesen  getrennten  Familien,  leiden- \nschaftlich übers  Kreuz  verliebt,  ja  das  eine  Paar  heimUch \nverheiratet.  Es  ging  wild  und  grausam  zu,  und  nichts \nblieb  zuletzt  übrig,  um  die  jungen  Leute  glücklich  zu \nmachen,  als  daß  die  beiden  Väter  sich  erstachen,  worauf \nunter  lebhaftem  Händeklatschen  der  Vorhang  fiel.  Nun \nward  aber  das  Klatschen  heftiger,  nun  wurde  Fuora  ge- \nrufen, und  das  so  lange,  bis  sich  die  zwei  Hauptpaare \nbequemten,  hinter  dem  Vorhang  hervorzukriechen,  ihre \nl)ücklinge  zu  machen  und  auf  der  andern  Seite  wieder  ab- \nzugehen. \n\nDas  Publikum  war  noch  nicht  befriedigt,  es  klatschte  fort \nund  rief  I  morti!  Das  dauerte  so  lange,  bis  die  zwei \nToten  auch  herauskamen  und  sich  bückten,  da  denn  einige \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  85 \n\nStimmen  riefen  Bravi  i  morti!  Sie  wurden  durch  Klatschen \nlange  festgehalten,  bis  man  ihnen  gleichfalls  endlich  ab- \nzugehen erlaubte.  Diese  Posse  gewinnt  für  den  Augen- \nund  Ohrenzeugen  unendlich,  der  das  Bravo!  Bravi!  das \ndie  Italiener  immer  im  Munde  führen,  so  in  den  Ohren \nhat  wie  ich,  und  dann  auf  einmal  auch  die  Toten  mit \ndiesem  Ehrenwort  anrufen  hört. \n\nGute  Nacht!  so  können  wir  Nordländer  zu  jeder  Stunde \nsagen,  wenn  wir  im  Finstern  scheiden;  der  Italiener  sagt \nFelicissima  notte!  nur  einmal,  und  zwar  wenn  das  Licht \nin  das  Zimmer  gebracht  wird,  indem  Tag  und  Nacht  sich \nscheiden,  und  da  heißt  es  denn  etwas  ganz  anderes.  So \nunübersetzlich  sind  die  Eigenheiten  jeder  Sprache:  denn \nvom  höchsten  bis  zum  tiefsten  Wort  bezieht  sich  alles \nauf  Eigentümlichkeiten  der  Nation,  es  sei  nun  in  Cha- \nrakter, Gesinnungen  oder  Zuständen. \n\nDc7i  6.  Oktober. \nDie  Tragödie  gestern  hat  mich  manches  gelehrt.  Erst- \nlich habe  ich  gehört,  wie  die  Italiener  ihre  eilfsilbigen \nJamben  behandeln  und  deklamieren;  dann  habe  ich  be- \ngriffen, wie  klug  Gozzi  die  Masken  mit  den  tragischen \nFiguren  verbunden  hat.  Das  ist  das  eigentliche  Schau- \nspiel für  dieses  Volk:  denn  es  will  auf  eine  krude  Weise \ngerührt  sein,  es  nimmt  keinen  innigen,  zärtlichen  Anteil \nam  Unglücklichen,  es  freut  sie  nur,  wenn  der  Held  gut \nspricht;  denn  aufs  Reden  halten  sie  viel,  sodann  aber \nwollen  sie  lachen  oder  etwas  Albernes  vornehmen. \nIhr  Anteil  am  Schauspiel  ist  nur  als  an  einem  Wirklichen. \nDa  der  Tyrann  seinem  Sohne  das  Schwert  reichte  und \nforderte,  daß  dieser  seine  eigne  gegenüberstehende  Ge- \nmahlin umbringen  sollte,  fing  das  Volk  laut  an,  sein  Miß- \nvergnügen über  diese  Zumutung  zu  beweisen,  und  es \nfehlte  nicht  viel,  so  wäre  das  Stück  unterbrochen  worden. \nSie  verlangten,  der  Alte  sollte  sein  Schwert  zurückneh- \nmen, wodurch  denn  freilich  die  folgenden  Situationen \ndes  Stücks  wären  aufgehoben  worden.  Endlich  entschloß \nsich  der  bedrängte  Sohn,  trat  ins  Proszenium  und  bat \ndemütig,   sie  möchten  sich  nur  noch  einen  Augenblick \n\n\n86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngedulden,  die  Sache  werde  noch  ganz  nach  Wunsch  ab- \nlaufen. Künstlerisch  genommen  aber  war  diese  Situation \nnach  den  Umständen  albern  und  unnatürlich,  und  ich  lobte \ndas  Volk  um  sein  Gefühl. \n\nJetzt  verstehe  ich  besser  die  langen  Reden  und  das  viele \nHin-  und  Herdissertieren  im  griechischen  Trauerspiele. \nDie  Athenienser  hörten  noch  lieber  reden  und  verstanden \nsich  noch  besser  darauf  als  die  Italiener;  vor  den  Ge- \nrichtsstellen, wo  sie  den  ganzen  Tag  lagen,  lernten  sie \nschon  etwas. \n\nAn  den  ausgeführten  Werken  Palladios,  besonders  an \nden  Kirchen,  habe  ich  manches  Tadelnswürdige  neben \ndem  Köstlichsten  gefunden.  Wenn  ich  nun  so  bei  mir \nüberlegte,  inwiefern  ich  recht  oder  unrecht  hätte  gegen \neinen  solchen  außerordentlichen  Mann,  so  war  es,  als  ob \ner  dabei  stünde  und  mir  sagte:  das  und  das  habe  ich \nwider  Willen  gemacht,  aber  doch  gemacht,  weil  ich  unter \nden  gegebenen  Umständen  nur  auf  diese  Weise  meiner \nhöchsten  Idee  am  näch.sten  kommen  konnte. \nMir  scheint,  soviel  ich  auch  darüber  denke,  er  habe  bei \nBetrachtung  der  Höhe  und  Breite  einer  schon  bestehenden \nKirche,  eines  altern  Hauses,  wozu  er  Fassaden  errichten \nsollte,  nur  überlegt:  wie  gibst  du  diesen  Räumen  die \ngrößte  Form.-  im  einzelnen  mußt  du,  wegen  eintretenden \nBedürfnisses,  etwas  verrücken  oder  verpfuschen,  da  oder \ndort  wird  eine  Unschicklichkeit  entstehen;  aber  das \nmag  sein,  das  Ganze  wird  einen  hohen  Stil  haben,  und \ndu  wirst  dir  zur  Freude  arbeiten. \n\nUnd  so  hat  er  das  größte  Bild,  das  er  in  der  Seele  trug, \nauch  dahin  gebracht,  wo  es  nicht  ganz  paßte,  wo  er  es \nim  einzelnen  zerknittern  und  verstümmeln  mußte. \nDer  Flügel  in  der  Caritä  dagegen  muß  uns  deshalb  von \nso  hohem  Werte  sein,  weil  der  Künstler  freie  Hand  hatte \nund  seinem  Geist  unbedingt  folgen  durfte.  Wäre  das \nKloster  fertig  geworden,  so  stünde  vielleicht  in  der  ganzen \ngegenwärtigen  Welt  kein  vollkommneres  Werk  der  Bau- \nkunst. \nWie  er  gedacht  und  wie  er  gearbeitet,  wird  mir  immer \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  87 \n\nklarer,  je  mehr  ich  seine  Werke  lese  und  dabei  betrachte, \nwie  er  die  Alten  behandelt;  denn  er  macht  wenig  Worte, \nsie  sind  aber  alle  gewichtig.  Das  vierte  Buch,  das  die \nantiken  Tempel  darstellt,  ist  eine  rechte  Einleitung,  die \nalten  Reste  mit  Sinn  zu  beschauen. \n\nDen  7.  Oktober. \nGestern  abend  sah  ich  Elektra  von  Crebillon,  auf  dem \nTheater  San  Crisostomo,  nämlich  übersetzt.  Was  mir  das \nStück  abgeschmackt  vorkam  und  wie  es  mir  fürchterlich \nLangeweile  machte,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen. \nDie  Akteurs  sind  übrigens  brav  und  wissen  das  Publikum \nmit  einzelnen  Stellen  abzuspeisen!  Orest  hat  allein  drei \nverschiedene  Erzählungen,  poetisch  aufgestutzt,  in  eii?cr \nSzene.  Elektra,  ein  hübsches  Weibchen  von  mittlerer \nGröße  und  Stärke  und  fast  französischer  Lebhaftigkeit, \neinem  guten  Anstand,  spricht  die  Verse  schön;  nur  be- \ntrug sie  sich  von  Anfang  bis  zu  Ende  toll,  wie  es  leider \ndie  Rolle  verlangt.  Indessen  habe  ich  doch  wieder  ge- \nlernt. Der  italienische,  immer  eilfsilbige  Jambe  hat  für \ndie  Deklamation  große  Unbequemlichkeit,  weil  die  letzte \nSilbe  durchaus  kurz  ist  und,  wider  Willen  des  Deklama- \ntors, in  die  Höhe  schlägt. \n\nHeute  früh  war  ich  bei  dem  Hochamte,  welchem  der \nDoge  jährlich  an  diesem  Tage,  wegen  eines  alten  Siegs \nüber  die  Türken,  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen  Justina  bei- \nwohnen muß.  Wenn  an  dem  kleinen  Platz  die  vergolde- \nten Barken  landen,  die  den  Fürsten  und  einen  Teil  des \nAdels  bringen,  seltsam  gekleidete  Schiffer  sich  mit  rot \ngemalten  Bmdern  bemühen,  am  Ufer  die  Geistlichkeit,  die \nBrüdersch:ni\"ten  mit  angezündeten,  auf  Stangen  und  trag- \nbare silbeere  Leuchter  gesteckten  Kerzen  stehen,  drängen, \nwogen  'raue  warten,  dann  mit  Teppichen  beschlagene \nBrücker  Rühiden  Fahrzeugen  ans  Land  gestreckt  werden, \nzuerst  lein  Angen  violetten  Kleider  der  Savj,  dann  die \nlangersce,  e  der  Senatoren  sich  auf  dem  Pflaster  ent- \nfalten jhte,  da:  der  Alte,  mit  goldener  phrygischer  Mütze \ngeschilalamocan  längsten  goldenen  Talar,  mit  dem  Her- \n\n\n88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nmelinmantel,  aussteigt,  drei  Diener  sich  seiner  Schleppe \nbemächtigen,  alles  auf  einem  kleinen  Platz  vor  dem  Portal \neiner  Kirche,  vor  deren  Türen  die  Türkenfahnen  gehal- \nten werden,  so  glaubt  man  auf  einmal  eine'  alte  gewirkte \nTapete  zu  sehen,  aber  recht  gut  gezeichnet  und  koloriert. \nMir  nordischem  Flüchtling  hat  diese  Zeremonie  viele \nFreude  gemacht.  Bei  uns,  wo  alle  Feierlichkeiten  kurz- \nröckig  sind  und  wo  die  größte,  die  man  sich  denken  kann, \nmit  dem  Gewehr  auf  der  Schulter  begangen  wird,  möchte \nso  etwas  nicht  am  Ort  sein.  Aber  hierher  gehören  diese \nSchleppröcke,  diese  friedlichen  Begehungen. \nDer  Doge  ist  ein  gar  schön  gewachsener  und  schön  ge- \nbildeter Mann,  der  krank  sein  mag,  sich  aber  nur  noch \nso,  um  der  Würde  willen,  unter  dem  schweren  Rocke \ngerade  hält.  Sonst  sieht  er  aus  wie  der  Großpapa  des \nganzen  Geschlechts  und  ist  gar  hold  und  leutselig;  die \nKleidung  steht  sehr  gut,  das  Käppchen  unter  der  Mütze \nbeleidigt  nicht,  indem  es,  ganz  fein  und  dui-chsichtig,  auf \ndem  weißesten,  klarsten  Haar  von  der  Welt  ruht. \nEtwa  fünfzig  Nobili,  in  langen  dunkelroten  Schleppklei- \ndern, waren  mit  ihm,  meist  schöne  Männer,  keine  einzige \nvertrackte  Gestalt,  mehrere  groß,  mit  großen  Köpfen, \ndenen  die  blonden  Lockenperücken  wohl  ziemten;  vorge- \nbaute Gesichter,  weiches,  weißes  Fleisch,  ohne  schwam- \nmig und  widerwärtig  auszusehen,  vielmehr  klug,  ohne \nAnstrengung,  ruhig,  ihrer  selbst  gewiß,  Leichtigkeit  des \nDaseins  und  durchaus  eine  gewisse  Fröhlichkeit. \nWie  sich  alles  in  der  Kirche  rangiert  hatte  und  das \nHochamt  anfing,  zogen  die  Brüderschaften  zur  Haupttüre \nherein  und  zur  rechten  Seitentüre  wieder  hinaus,  nach- \ndem sie,  Paar  für  Paar,  das  Weihwasser  empfangen  und \nsich  gegen  den  Hochaltar,  den  Dogen  und  den(  Adel  ge- \nneigt hatten.  i \n\nAuf  heute  abend  hatte  ich  mir  den  famosen  Gesang  der \nSchiffer  bestellt,  die  den  Tasso  und  Ariost  auf  ihre  eignen \nMelodien  singen.  Dieses  muß  wirklich  bestellt  werden, \nes  kommt  nicht  gewöhnlich  vor,  es  gehört  vielmehr  zu \nden  halbverklungenen  Sagen  der  Vorzeit.    Bei  Monden- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  89 \n\nschein  bestieg  ich  eine  Gondel,  den  einen  Sänger  vorn, \nden  andern  hinten;  sie  fingen  ihr  Lied  an  und  sangen \nabwechselnd  Vers  für  Vers.  Die  Melodie,  welche  wir \ndurch  Rousseau  kennen,  ist  eine  Mittelart  zwischen  Choral \nund  Rezitativ,  sie  behält  immer  denselben  Gang,  ohne \nTakt  zu  haben;  die  Modulation  ist  auch  dieselbige,  nur \nverändern  sie,  nach  dem  Inhalt  des  Verses,  mit  einer  Art \nvon  Deklamation  sowohl  Ton  als  Maß;  der  Geist  aber, \ndas  Leben  davon,  läßt  sich  begreifen  wie  folgt. \nAuf  welchem  Wege  sich  die  Melodie  gemacht  hat,  will \nich  nicht  untersuchen,  genug,  sie  paßt  gar  trefflich  für \neinen  müßigen  Menschen,  der  sich  etwas  vormoduliert \nund  Gedichte,  die  er  auswendig  kann,  solchem  Gesang \nunterschiebt. \n\nMit  einer  durchdringenden  Stimme — das  Volk  schätzt \nStärke  vor  allem — sitzt  er  am  Ufer  einer  Insel,  eines \nKanals,  auf  einer  Barke  und  läßt  sein  Lied  schallen,  so \nweit  er  kann.  Über  den  stillen  Spiegel  verbreitet  sich's. \nIn  der  Ferne  vernimmt  es  ein  anderer,  der  die  Melodie \nkennt,  die  Worte  versteht  und  mit  dem  folgenden  Verse \nantwortet;  hierauf  erwidert  der  erste,  und  so  ist  einer \nimmer  das  Echo  des  andern.  Der  Gesang  währt  Nächte \ndurch,  unterhält  sie,  ohne  zu  ermüden.  Je  ferner  sie  also \nvoneinander  sind,  desto  reizender  kann  das  Lied  werden; \nwenn  der  Hörer  alsdann  zwischen  beiden  steht,  so  ist  er \nam  rechten  Flecke. \n\nUm  dieses  mich  vernehmen  zu  lassen,  stiegen  sie  am \nUfer  der  Giudecca  aus;  sie  teilten  sich  am  Kanal  hin,  ich \nging  zwischen  ihnen  auf  und  ab,  so  daß  ich  immer  den \nverließ,  der  zu  singen  anfangen  sollte,  und  mich  dem- \njenigen wieder  näherte,  der  aufgehört  hatte.  Da  ward \nmir  der  Sinn  des  Gesangs  erst  aufgeschlossen.  Als  Stimme \naus  der  Feme  klingt  es  höchst  sonderbar,  wie  eine  Klage \nohne  Trauer;  es  ist  darin  etwas  unglaublich,  bis  zu \nTränen  Rührendes.  Ich  schrieb  es  meiner  Stimmung  zu; \naber  mein  Alter  sagte:  6  singolare,  come  quel  canto  in- \ntenerisce,  e  molto  piü,  quando  e  piü  ben  cantato.  Er \nwünschte,  daß  ich  die  Weiber  vom  Lido,  besonders  die \nvon  Malamocco  und  Palestrina  hören  möchte;  auch  diese \n\n\n90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsängen  den  Tasso  auf  gleiche  und  ähnliche  Melodien. \nEr  sagte  ferner:  Sie  haben  die  Gewohnheit,  wenn  ihre \nMänner  aufs  Fischen  ins  Meer  sind,  sich  ans  Ufer  zu \nsetzen  und  mit  durchdringender  Stimme  abends  diese \nGesänge  erschallen  zu  lassen,  bis  sie  auch  von  ferne  die \nStimme  der  Ihrigen  vernehmen  und  sich  so  mit  ihnen \nunterhalten.  Ist  das  nicht  sehr  schön  .>  Und  doch  läßt \nsich  wohl  denken,  daß  ein  Zuhörer  in  der  Nähe  wenig \nFreude  an  solchen  Stimmen  haben  möchte,  die  mit  den \nWellen  des  Meeres  kämpfen.  Menschlich  aber  und  wahr \nwird  der  Begriff  dieses  Gesanges,  lebendig  wird  die \nMelodie,  über  deren  tote  Buchstaben  wir  uns  sonst  den \nKopf  zerbrochen  haben.  Gesang  ist  es  eines  Einsamen  in \ndie  Ferne  und  Weite,  damit  ein  anderer,  Gleichgestimm- \nter, höre  und  antworte. \n\nDen  8.  Oktober. \nDen  Palast  Pisani  Moretta  besuchte  ich  wegen  eines  köst- \nlichen Bildes  von  Paul  Veronese.     Die  weibliche  Familie \ndes  Darius  kniet  vor  Alexandern  und  Hephästion:    die \nvoranknieende  Mutter  hält  den  letztern  für  den  König; \ner  lehnt  es  ab  und  deutet  auf  den  Rechten.    Man  erzählt \ndas  Märchen,  der  Künstler  sei  in  diesem  Palast  gut  auf- \ngenommen und  längere  Zeit  ehrenvoll  bewirtet  worden, \ndagegen  habe  er  das  Bild  heimlich  gemalt  und,  als  Ge- \nschenk, zusammengerollt  unter  das  Bett  geschoben.    Es \nverdient  allerdings  einen  besondern  Ursprung  zu  haben, \ndenn  es  gibt  einen  Begriff  von  dem  ganzen  Werte  des \nMeisters.     Seine  große  Kunst,   ohne  einen  allgemeinen \nTon,    der   über  das   ganze  Stück   gezogen  wäre,  durch \nkunstreich  verteiltes  Licht  und  Schatten  und  ebenso  weis- \nlich abwechselnde  Lokalfarben  die  köstlichste  Harmonie \nhervorzubringen,  ist  hier  recht  sichtbar,  da  das  Bild  voll- \nkommen erhalten  und  frisch,  wie  von  gestern    vor  uns \nsteht:  denn  freilich,  sobald  ein  Gemälde  dieser  Art  ge- \nlitten hat,  wird  unser  Genuß  sogleich  getrübt,  ohne  daß \nwir  wissen,  was  die  Ursache  sei. \n\nWer    mit  dem    Künstler   wegen   des  Kostüms   rechten \nwollte,  der  dürfte  sich  nur  sagen,  es  habe  eine  Geschichte \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  91 \n\ndes  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  gemalt  werden  sollen,  und \nso  ist  alles  abgetan.  Die  Abstufung  von  der  Mutter  durch \nGemahlin  und  Töchter  ist  höchst  wahr  und  glücklich;  die \njüngste  Prinzeß,  ganz  am  Ende  knieend,  ist  ein  hübsches \nMäuschen  und  hat  ein  gar  artiges,  eigensinniges,  trotziges \nGesichtchen,  ihre  Lage  scheint  ihr  gar  nicht  zu  gefallen. \n\nMeine  alte  Gabe,  die  Welt  mit  Augen  desjenigen  Malers \nzu  sehen,  dessen  Bilder  ich  mir  eben  eingedrückt,  brachte \nmich  auf  einen  eignen  Gedanken.  Es  ist  offenbar,  daß \nsich  das  Auge  nach  den  Gegenständen  bildet,  die  es  von \nJugend  auf  erblickt,  und  so  muß  der  venezianische  Maler \nalles  klarer  und  heiterer  sehn  als  andere  Menschen.  Wir, \ndie  wir  auf  einem  bald  schmutzkotigen,  bald  staubigen, \nfarblosen,  die  Widerscheine  verdüsternden  Boden,  und \nvielleicht  gar  in  engen  Gemächern  leben,  können  einen \nsolchen  Frohblick  aus  uns  selbst  nicht  entwickeln. \nAls  ich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  durch  die  Lagunen \nfuhr  und  auf  den  Gondelrändern  die  Gondoliere  leicht \nschwebend,  buntbekleidet,  rudernd  betrachtete,  wie  sie \nauf  der  hellgrünen  Fläche  sich  in  der  blauen  Luft  zeich- \nneten, so  sah  ich  das  beste,  frischeste  Bild  der  venezia- \nnischen Schule.  Der  Sonnenschein  hob  die  Lokalfarben \nblendend  hervor,  und  die  Schattenseiten  waren  so  licht, \ndaß  sie  verhältnismäßig  wieder  zu  Lichtern  hätten  dienen \nkönnen.  Ein  gleiches  galt  von  den  Widerscheinen  des \nmeergrünen  Wassers.  Alles  war  hell  in  hell  gemalt,  so \ndaß  die  schäumende  Welle  und  die  Blitzlichter  darauf \nnötig  waren,  um  die  Tüpfchen  aufs  i  zu  setzen. \nTizian  und  Paul  hatten  diese  Klarheit  im  höchsten  Grade, \nund  wo  man  sie  in  ihren  Werken  nicht  findet,  hat  das \nBild  verloren  oder  ist  aufgemalt. \n\nDie  Kuppeln  und  Gewölbe  der  Markuskirche,  nebst  ihren \nSeitenflächen,  alles  ist  bilderreich,  alles  bunte  Figuren \nauf  goldenem  Grunde,  alles  musivische  Arbeit;  einige \nsind  recht  gut,  andere  gering,  je  nachdem  die  Meister \nwaren,  die  den  Karton  verfertigten. \nEs  fiel  mir  recht  aufs  Herz,  daß  doch  alles  auf  die  erste \nErfindung  ankommt  und  daß  diese  das  rechte  Maß,  den \n\n\n92  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nwahren  Geist  habe,  da  man  mit  viereckten  Stückchen \nGlas,  und  hier  nicht  einmal  auf  die  sauberste  Weise,  das \nGute  sowohl  als  das  Schlechte  nachbilden  kann.  Die \nKunst,  welche  dem  Alten  seine  Fußboden  bereitete,  dem \nChristen  seine  Kirchenhimmel  wölbte,  hat  sich  jetzt  auf \nDosen  und  Armbänder  verkrümelt.  Diese  Zeiten  sind \nschlechter,  als  man  denkt. \n\nIn  dem  Hause  Farsetti  ist  eine  kostbare  Sammlung  von \nAbgüssen  der  besten  Antiken.  Ich  schweige  von  denen, \ndie  ich  von  Mannheim  her  und  sonst  schon  gekannt,  und \nerwähne  nur  neuere  Bekanntschaften.  Eine  Kleopatra  in \nkolossaler  Ruhe,  die  Aspis  um  den  Arm  geschlungen  und \nin  den  Tod  hinüberschlafend;  ferner  die  Mutter  Niobe, \ndie  ihre  jüngste  Tochter  mit  dem  Mantel  vor  den  Pfeilen \ndes  Apollo  deckt;  sodann  einige  Gladiatoren,  ein  in  sei- \nnen Flügeln  ruhender  Genius,  sitzende  und  stehende \nPhilosophen. \n\nEs  sind  Werke,  an  denen  sich  die  Welt  Jahrtausende \nfreuen  und  bilden  kann,  ohne  den  Wert  des  Künstlers \ndurch  Gedanken  zu  erschöpfen. \n\nViele  bedeutende  Büsten  versetzen  mich  in  die  alten \nherrlichen  Zeiten.  Nur  fühle  ich  leider,  wie  weit  ich  in \ndiesen  Kenntnissen  zurück  bin;  doch  es  wird  vorwärts \ngehen,  wenigstens  weiß  ich  den  Weg.  Palladio  hat  mir \nihn  auch  dazu,  und  zu  aller  Kunst  und  Leben  geöffnet. \nEs  klingt  das  vielleicht  ein  wenig  wunderlich,  aber  doch \nnicht  so  paradox,  als  wenn  Jakob  Böhme  bei  Erblickung \neiner  zinnernen  Schüssel  durch  Einstrahlung  Jovis  über \ndas  Universum  erleuchtet  wurde.  Auch  steht  in  dieser \nSammlung  ein  Stück  des  Gebälks  vom  Tempel  des  An- \ntonius und  der  Faustina  in  Rom.  Die  vorspringende \nGegenwart  dieses  herrlichen  Architekturgebildes  erinnerte \nmich  an  das  Kapital  des  Pantheon  in  Mannheim.  Das  ist \nfreilich  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  kauzenden,  auf  Krag- \nsteinlein übereinander  geschichteten  Heiligen  der  goti- \nschen Zierweisen,  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  Tabakspfeifen - \nSäulen,  spitze  Türmlein  und  Blumenzacken;  diese  bin  ich \nnun,  Gott  sei  Dank,  auf  ewig  los! \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  93 \n\nNoch  will  ich  einiger  Werke  der  Bildhauerkunst  erwähnen, \ndie  ich  diese  Tage  her,  zwar  nur  im  Vorbeigehen,  aber \ndoch  mit  Erstaunen  und  Erbauung  betrachtet:  zwei  un- \ngeheure Löwen,  von  weißem  Marmor,  vor  dem  Tore  des \nArsenals;  der  eine  sitzt  aufgerichtet,  auf  die  Vorder- \npfoten gestemmt,  der  andere  liegt — herrliche  Gegenbilder \nvon  lebendiger  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Sie  sind  so  groß,  daß \nsie  alles  umher  klein  machen  und  daß  man  selbst  zu- \nnichte würde,  wenn  erhabene  Gegenstände  uns  nicht  er- \nhüben. Sie  sollen  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit  und \nvom  Piraeus  in  den  glänzenden  Tagen  der  Republik  hier- \nher gebracht  sein. \n\nAus  Athen  mögen  gleichfalls  ein  paar  Basreliefe  stam- \nmen, in  dem  Tempel  der  heiligen  Justina,  der  Türken- \nbesiegerin,  eingemauert,  aber  leider  durch  Kirchstühle \neinigermaßen  verfinstert.  Der  Küster  machte  mich  auf- \nmerksam darauf,  weil  die  Sage  gehe,  daß  Tizian  seine \nunendlich  schönen  Engel  im  Bilde,  die  Ermordung  des \nheiligen  Petrus  Martyr  vorstellend,  darnach  geformt  habe. \nEs  sind  Genien,  welche  sich  mit  Attributen  der  Götter \nschleppen,  freilich  so  schön,  daß  es  allen  Begriff  über- \nsteigt. \n\nSodann  betrachtete  ich  mit  ganz  eignem  Gefühl  die \nnackte  kolossale  Statue  des  Markus  Agrippa,  in  dem  Hofe \neines  Palastes;  ein  sich  ihm  zur  Seite  heraufschlängeln- \nder Delphin  deutet  auf  einen  Seehelden.  Wie  doch  eine \nsolche  heroische  Darstellung  den  reinen  Menschen  Göt- \ntern ähnlich  macht! \n\nDie  Pferde  auf  der  Markuskirche  besah  ich  in  der  Nähe. \nVon  unten  hinauf  bemerkt  man  leicht,  daß  sie  fleckig \nsind,  teils  einen  schönen  gelben  Metallglanz  haben,  teils \nkupfergrünlich  angelaufen.  In  der  Nähe  sieht  und  erfährt \nman,  daß  sie  ganz  verguldet  waren,  und  sieht  sie  über \nund  über  mit  Striemen  bedeckt,  da  die  Barbaren  das \nGold  nicht  abfeilen,  sondern  abhauen  wollten.  Auch  das \nist  gut,  so  blieb  wenigstens  die  Gestalt. \nEin  herrlicher  Zug  Pferde!  ich  möchte  einen  rechten \nPferdekenner  darüber  reden  hören.     Was  mir  sonderbar \n\n\n94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nscheint,  ist,  daß  sie  in  der  Nähe  schwer  und  unten  vom \nPlatz  leicht  wie  die  Hirsche  aussehen. \n\nIch  fuhr  heute  früh  mit  meinem  Schutzgeiste  aufs  Lido, \nauf  die  Erdzunge,  welche  die  Lagunen  schließt  und  sie \nvom  Meere  absondert.  Wir  stiegen  aus  und  gingen  quer \nüber  die  Zunge.  Ich  hörte  ein  starkes  Geräusch:  es  war \n(las  Meer,  und  ich  sah  es  bald,  es  ging  hoch  gegen  das \nUfer,  indem  es  sich  zurückzog,  es  war  um  Mittag,  Zeit \nder  Ebbe.  So  habe  ich  denn  auch  das  Meer  mit  Augen \ngesehen  und  bin  auf  der  schönen  Tenne,  die  es  weichend \nzurückläßt,  ihm  nachgegangen.  Da  hätte  ich  mir  die \nKinder  gewünscht,  um  der  Muscheln  willen;  ich  habe, \nselbst  kindisch,  ihrer  genug  aufgelesen;  doch  widme  ich \nsie  zu  einigem  Gebrauch:  ich  möchte  von  der  Feuchtig- \nkeit des  Tintenfisches,  die  hier  so  häufig  wegfließt,  etwas \neintrocknen. \n\nAuf  dem  Lido,  nicht  weit  vom  Meer,  liegen  Engländer \nbegraben,  und  weiterhin  Juden,  die  beiderseits  in  ge- \nweihtem Boden  nicht  ruhen  sollten.  Ich  fand  das  Grab \ndes  edlen  Konsul  Smith  und  seiner  ersten  Frauen;  ich \nbin  ihm  mein  Exemplar  des  Palladio  schuldig  und  dankte \nihm  auf  seinem  ungeweihten  Grabe  dafür, \nlind  nicht  allein  ungeweiht,  sondern  halbverschüttet  ist \ndas  Grab.  Das  Lido  ist  immer  nur  wie  eine  Düne  anzu- \nsehen; der  Sand  wird  dorthin  geführt,  vom  Winde  hin \nund  her  getrieben,  aufgehäuft,  überall  angedrängt.  In \nweniger  Zeit  wird  man  das  ziemlich  erhöhte  Monument \nkaum  wiederfinden  können. \n\nDas  Meer  ist  doch  ein  großer  Anblick!  Ich  will  sehen, \nin  einem  Fischerkahn  eine  Fahrt  zu  tun:  die  Gondeln \nwagen  sich  nicht  hinaus. \n\nAm  Meere  habe  ich  auch  verschiedene  Pflanzen  gefun- \nden, deren  ähnlicher  Charakter  mir  ihre  Eigenschaften \nnäher  kennen  ließ:  sie  sind  alle  zugleich  mastig  und \nstreng,  saftig  und  zäh,  und  es  ist  offenbar,  daß  das  alte \nSalz  des  Sandbodens,  mehr  aber  die  salzige  Luft  ihnen \ndiese  Eigenschaften  gibt;    sie  strotzen  von  Säften,  wie \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  95 \n\nWasserpflanzen,  sie  sind  fest  und  zäh,  wie  Bergpflanzen; \nwenn  ihre  Blätterenden  eine  Neigung  zu  Stacheln  haben, \nwie  Disteln  tun,  sind  sie  gewaltig  spitz  und  stark.  Ich \nfand  einen  solchen  Busch  Blätter;  es  schien  mir  unser \nunschuldiger  Huflattich,  hier  aber  mit  scharfen  Wafien \nbewatihet,  und  das  Blatt  wie  Leder,  so  auch  die  Samen- \nkapseln, die  Stiele,  alles  mastig  und  fest.  Ich  bringe \nSamen  mit  und  eingelegte  Blätter  (Eryngium  mari- \ntimum). \n\nDer  Fischmarkt  und  die  unendlichen  Seeprodukte  machen \nmir  viel  Vergnügen;  ich  gehe  oft  darüber  und  beleuchte \ndie  unglücklichen  aufgehaschten  Meeresbewohner. \n\nDen  g.  Oktober. \nEin  köstlicher  Tag,  vom  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht!  Ich \nfuhr  bis  Palestrina  gegen  Chiozza  über,  wo  die  großen \nBaue  sind,  Murazzi  genannt,  welche  die  Republik  gegen \ndas  Meer  aufführen  läßt.  Sie  sind  von  gehauenen  Stei- \nnen und  sollen  eigentlich  die  lange  Erdzunge,  Lido  ge- \nnannt, welche  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere  trennt,  vor \ndiesem  wilden  Elemente  schützen. \n\nDie  Lagunen  sind  eine  Wirkung  der  alten  Natur.  Erst \nEbbe,  Flut  und  Erde,  gegeneinander  arbeitend,  dann \ndas  allmähliche  Sinken  des  Urgewässers  waren  Ursache, \ndaß  am  obern  Ende  des  Adriatischen  Meeres  sich  eine \nansehnliche  Sumpfstrecke  befindet,  welche  von  der  Flut \nbesucht,  von  der  Ebbe  zum  Teil  verlassen  wird.  Die \nKunst  hat  sich  der  höchsten  Stellen  bemächtigt,  und  so \nliegt  Venedig,  von  hundert  Inseln  zusammen  gruppiert \nund  von  hunderten  umgeben.  Zugleich  hat  man,  mit  un- \nglaublicher Anstrengung  und  Kosten,  tiefe  Kanäle  in  den \nSumpf  gefurcht,  damit  man  auch  zur  Zeit  der  Ebbe  mit \nKriegsschiffen  an  die  Hauptstellen  gelangen  könne.  Was \nMenschenwitz  und  Fleiß  vor  alters  ersonnen  und  ausge- \nführt, muß  Klugheit  und  Fleiß  nun  erhalten.  Das  Lido, \nein  langer  Erdstreif,  trennt  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere, \nwelches  nur  an  zwei  Orten  hereintreten  kann,  bei  dem \nKastell  nämlich  und  am  entgegengesetzten  Ende,  bei \nChiozza.     Die  Flut  tritt  gewöhnlich  des  Tages  zweimal \n\n\n96  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nherein,  und  die  Ebbe  bringt  das  Wasser  zweimal  hinaus, \nimmer  durch  denselben  Weg  in  denselben  Richtungen. \nDie  Flut  bedeckt  die  innern  morastigen  Stellen  und  läßt \ndie  erhühteren,  wo  nicht  trocken,  doch  sichtbar. \nGanz  anders  wäre  es,  wenn  das  Meer  sich  neue  Wege \nsuchte,  die  Erdzunge  angriffe  und  nach  Willkür  hinein \nund  heraus  flutete.  Nicht  gerechnet,  daß  die  Örtchen \nauf  dem  Lido,  Palestrina,  St.  Peter  und  andere,  unter- \ngehen müßten,  so  würden  auch  jene  Kommunikations- \nkanäle ausgefüllt  und,  indem  das  Wasser  alles  durchein- \nander schlemmte,  das  Lido  zu  Inseln,  die  Inseln,  die \njetzt  dahinterliegen,  zu  Erdzungen  verwandelt  werden. \nDieses  zu  verhüten,  müssen  sie  das  Lido  verwahren,  was \nsie  können,  damit  das  Element  nicht  dasjenige  willkür- \nlich angreifen,  hinüber  und  herüber  werfen  möge,  was \ndie  Menschen  schon  in  Besitz  genommen,  dem  sie  schon \nzu  einem  gewissen  Zweck  Gestalt  und  Richtung  gegeben \nhaben. \n\nBei  außerordentlichen  Fällen,  wenn  das  Meer  übermäßig \nwächst,  ist  es  besonders  gut,  daß  es  nur  an  zwei  Orten \nherein  darf  und  das  übrige  geschlossen  bleibt;  es  kann \nalso  doch  nicht  mit  der  größten  Gewalt  eindringen  und \nmuß  sich  in  einigen  Stunden  dem  Gesetz  der  Ebbe  unter- \nwerfen und  seine  Wut  mindern. \n\nÜbrigens  hat  Venedig  nichts  zu  besorgen:  die  Langsam- \nkeit, mit  der  das  Meer  abnimmt,  gibt  ihr  Jahrtausende \nZeit,  und  sie  werden  schon,  den  Kanälen  klug  nach- \nhelfend, sich  im  Besitz  zu  erhalten  suchen. \nWenn  sie  ihre  Stadt  nur  reinlicher  hielten,  welches  so \nnotwendig  als  leicht  ist  und  wirklich,  auf  die  Folge  von \nJahrhunderten,  von  großer  Konsequenz.  Nun  ist  zwar \nbei  großer  Strafe  verboten,  nichts  in  die  Kanäle  zu \nschütten  noch  Kehricht  hineinzuwerfen;  einem  schnell \neinfallenden  Regenguß  aber  ist's  nicht  untersagt,  allen \nden  in  die  Ecken  geschobnen  Kehricht  aufzurühren,  in \ndie  Kanäle  zu  schleppen,  ja,  was  noch  schlimmer  ist,  in \ndie  Abzüge  zu  führen,  die  nur  zum  Abfluß  des  Wassers \nbestimmt  sind,  und  sie  dergestalt  zu  verschlemmen,  daß \ndie  Hauptplätze  in  Gefahr  sind,  unter  Wasser  zu  stehen. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  97 \n\nSelbst  einige  Abzüge  auf  dem  kleinen  Markusplatze,  die, \nwie  auf  dem  großen,  gar  klug  angelegt  sind,  habe  ich \nverstopft  und  voll  Wasser  gesehen. \n\nWenn  ein  Tag  Regenwetter  einfällt,  ist  ein  unleidlicher \nKot;  alles  flucht  und  schimpft,  man  besudelt  beim  Auf- \nund  Absteigen  der  Brücken  die  Mäntel,  die  Tabarros, \nwomit  man  sich  ja  das  ganze  Jahr  schleppt,  und  da  alles \nin  Schuh  und  Strümpfen  läuft,  bespritzt  man  sich  und \nschilt;  denn  man  hat  sich  nicht  mit  gemeinem,  sondern \nbeizendem  Kot  besudelt.  Das  Wetter  wird  wieder  schön, \nund  kein  Mensch  denkt  an  Reinlichkeit.  Wie  wahr  ist  es \ngesagt:  das  Publikum  beklagt  sich  immer,  daß  es  schlecht \nbedient  sei,  und  weiß  es  nicht  anzufangen,  besser  be- \ndient zu  werden.  Hier,  wenn  der  Souverän  wollte,  könnte \nalles  gleich  getan  sein. \n\nHeute  abend  ging  ich  auf  den  Markustumi;  denn  da  ich \nneulich  die  Lagunen  in  ihrer  Herrlichkeit,  zur  Zeit  der \nFlut,  von  oben  gesehen,  wollt'  ich  sie  auch  zur  Zeit  der \nEbbe,  in  ihrer  Demut,  schauen,  und  es  ist  notwendig, \ndiese  beiden  Bilder  zu  verbinden,  wenn  man  einen  rich- \ntigen Begrift\"  haben  will.  Es  sieht  sonderbar  aus,  ringsum \nüberall  Land  erscheinen  zu  sehen,  wo  vorher  Wasser- \nspiegel war.  Die  Inseln  sind  nicht  mehr  Inseln,  nur \nhöher  bebaute  Flecke  eines  großen  graugrünlichen  Mo- \nrastes, den  schöne  Kanäle  durchschneiden.  Der  sumpfige \nTeil  ist  mit  Wasserpflanzen  bewachsen  und  muß  sich  auch \ndadurch  nach  imd  nach  erheben,  obgleich  Ebbe  und  Flut \nbeständig  daran  rupfen  und  wühlen  und  der  Vegetation \nkeine  Ruhe  lassen. \n\nIch  wende  mich  mit  meiner  Erzählung  nochmals  ans  Meer. \nDort  habe  ich  heute  die  Wirtschaft  der  Seeschnecken,  Pa- \ntellen und  Taschenkrebse  gesehen  und  mich  herzlich  dar- \nüber gefreut.  Was  ist  doch  ein  Lebendiges  für  ein  köst- \nliches, herrliches  Ding!  wie  abgemessen  zu  seinem  Zu- \nstande, wie  wahr,  wie  seiend!  Wie  viel  nützt  mir  nicht  mein \nbißchen  Studium  der  Natur,  und  wie  freue  ich  mich,  es \nfortzusetzen!  Doch  ich  will,  da  es  sich  mitteilen  läßt,  die \nFreunde  nicht  mit  bloßen  Ausrufungen  anreizen. \n\nGOETHE  IV  7 \n\n\n98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  dem  Meere  entgegengebauten  Mauerwerke  bestehen \nerst  aus  einigen  steilen  Stufen,  dann  kommt  eine  sacht \nansteigende  Fläche,  sodann  wieder  eine  Stufe,  abermals \neine  sanft  ansteigende  Fläche,  dann  eine  steile  Mauer \nmit  einem  oben  überhängenden  Kopfe.  Diese  Stufen,  diese \nFlächen  hinan  steigt  nun  das  flutende  Meer,  bis  es,  in \naußerordentlichen  Fällen,  endlich  oben  an  der  Mauer \nund  deren  Vorsprung  zerschellt. \n\nDem  Meere  folgen  seine  Bewohner,  kleine  eßbare  Schnek- \nken,  einschalige  Patellen,  und  was  sonst  noch  beweg- \nlich ist,  besonders  die  Taschenkrebse.  Kaum  aber  haben \ndiese  Tiere  an  den  glatten  Mauern  Besitz  genommen,  so \nzieht  sich  schon  das  Meer,  weichend  und  schwellend,  wie \nes  gekommen,  wieder  zurück.  Anfangs  weiß  das  Ge- \nwimmel nicht,  woran  es  ist,  und  hoftt  immer,  die  salzige \nFlut  soll  wiederkehren;  allein  sie  bleibt  aus,  die  Sonne \nsticht  und  trocknet  schnell,  und  nun  geht  der  Rückzug \nan.  Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  suchen  die  Taschenkrebse \nihren  Raub.  Wunderlicher  und  komischer  kann  man \nnichts  sehen  als  die  Gebärden  dieser  aus  einem  runden \nKörper  und  zwei  langen  Scheren  bestehenden  Geschöpfe; \ndenn  die  übrigen  Spinnenfüße  sind  nicht  bemerklich.  Wie \nauf  stelzenartigen  Armen  schreiten  sie  einher,  und  so- \nbald eine  Patelle  sich  unter  ihrem  Schild  vom  Flecke \nbewegt,  fahren  sie  zu,  um  die  Schere  in  den  schmalen \nRaum  zwischen  der  Schale  und  dem  Boden  zu  stecken, \ndas  Dach  umzukehren  und  die  Auster  zu  verschmausen. \nDie  Patelle  zieht  sachte  ihren  Weg  hin,  saugt  sich  aber \ngleich  fest  an  den  Stein,  sobald  sie  die  Nähe  des  Feindes \nmerkt.  Dieser  gebärdet  sich  nun  wunderlich  um  das \nDächelchen  herum,  gar  zierlich  und  alienhaft;  aber  ihm \nfehlt  die  Kraft,  den  mächtigen  Muskel  des  weichen  Tier- \nchens zu  überwältigen,  er  tut  auf  diese  Beute  Verzicht, \neilt  auf  eine  andere  wandernde  los,  und  die  erste  setzt \nihren  Zug  sachte  fort.  Ich  habe  nicht  gesehen,  daß  irgend \nein  Taschenkrebs  zu  seinem  Zweck  gelangt  wäre,  ob  ich \ngleich  den  Rückzug  dieses  Gewimmels  stundenlang,  wie \nsie  die  beiden  Flächen  und  die  dazwischen  liegenden \nStufen  hinabschlichen,  beobachtet  habe. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  99 \n\nDcti  10.  Oktober. \nNun  endlich  kann  ich  denn  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  eine  Ko- \nmödie gesehen  habe!  Sie  spielten  heut  auf  dem  Theater \nSt.  Lukas:  Le  Baruffe  Chiozzotte,  welches  allenfalls  zu \nübersetzen  wäre:  Die  Rauf-  und  Schreihändel  von  Chi- \nozza.  Die  Handelnden  sind  lauter  Seeleute,  Einwohner \nvon  Chiozza,  und  ihre  Weiber,  Schwestern  und  Töchter. \nDas  gewöhnliche  Geschrei  dieser  Leute,  im  Guten  und \nBösen,  ihre  Händel,  Heftigkeit,  Gutmütigkeit,  Plattheit, \nWitz,  Humor  und  ungezwungene  Manieren,  alles  ist  gar \nbrav  nachgeahmt.  Das  Stück  ist  noch  von  Goldoni,  und \nda  ich  erst  gestern  in  jener  Gegend  war  und  mir  Stim- \nmen und  Betragen  der  See-  und  Hafenleute  noch  im \nAug'  und  Ohr  widerschien  und  widerklang,  so  machte \nes  gar  große  Freude,  und  ob  ich  gleich  manchen  einzel- \nnen Bezug  nicht  verstand,  so  konnte  ich  doch  dem  Gan- \nzen recht  gut  folgen.  Der  Plan  des  Stücks  ist  folgender. \nDie  Einwohnerinnen  von  Chiozza  sitzen  auf  der  Reede \nvor  ihren  Häusern,  spinnen,  stricken,  nähen,  klippein, \nwie  gewöhnlich;  ein  junger  Mensch  geht  vorüber  und \ngrüßt  eine  freundlicher  als  die  übrigen;  sogleich  fängt \ndas  Sticheln  an;  dies  hält  nicht  Maße,  es  schärft  sich  und \nwächst  bis  zum  Hohne,  steigert  sich  zu  Vorwürfen,  eine \nUnart  überbietet  die  andere;  eine  heftige  Nachbarin  platzt \nmit  der  Wahrheit  heraus,  und  nun  ist  Schelten,  Schimp- \nfen, Schreien  auf  einmal  losgebunden,  es  fehlt  nicht  an \nentschiedenen  Beleidigungen,  so  daß  die  Gerichtspersonen \nsich  einzumischen  genötigt  sind. \n\nIm  zweiten  Akt  befindet  man  sich  in  der  Gerichtsstube. \nDer  Aktuarius  an  der  Stelle  des  abwesenden  Podesta,  der \nals  Nobile  nicht  auf  dem  Theater  hätte  erscheinen  dürfen, \nder  Aktuarius  also  läßt  die  Frauen  einzeln  vorfordern: \ndieses  wird  dadurch  bedenklich,  daß  er  selbst  in  die  erste \nLiebhaberin  verliebt  ist  und,  sehr  glücklich  sie  allein  zu \nsprechen,  anstatt  sie  zu  verhören  ihr  eine  Liebeserklärung \ntut.  Eine  andere,  die  in  den  Aktuarius  verliebt  ist,  stürzt \neifersüchtig  herein,  der  aufgeregte  Liebhaber  der  ersten \ngleichfalls,   die   übrigen   folgen,   neue   Vorwürfe  häufen \n\n\nloo  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich,  und  nun  ist  der  Teufel  in  der  Gerichtsstube  los,  wie \nvorher  auf  dem  Hafenplatz. \n\nIm  dritten  Akt  steigert  sich  der  Scherz,  und  das  Ganze \nendet  mit  einer  eiligen  notdürftigen  Auflösung.  Der  glück- \nlichste Gedanke  jedoch  ist  in  einem  Charakter  ausge- \ndrückt, der  sich  folgendermaßen  darstellt. \nEin  alter  Schiffer,  dessen  Gliedmaßen,  besonders  aber \ndie  Sprachorgane,  durch  eine  von  Jugend  auf  geführte \nharte  Lebensart  stockend  geworden,  tritt  auf,  als  Gegen- \nsatz des  beweglichen,  schwätzenden,  schreiseligen  Volkes; \ner  nimmt  immer  erst  einen  Anlauf  durch  Bewegung  der \nLippen  und  Nachhelfen  der  Hände  und  Arme,  bis  er \ndenn  endlich,  was  er  gedacht,  herausstößt.  Weil  ihm \ndieses  aber  nur  in  kurzen  Sätzen  gelingt,  so  hat  er  sich \neinen  lakonischen  Ernst  angewöhnt,  dergestalt,  daß  alles, \nwas  er  sagt,  sprüchwörtlich  oder  sentenzios  klingt,  wo- \ndurch denn  das  übrige  wilde,  leidenschaftliche  Handeln \ngar  schön  ins  Gleichgewicht  gesetzt  wird. \nAber  auch  so  eine  Lust  habe  ich  noch  nie  erlebt,  als  das \nVolk  laut  werden  ließ,  sich  und  die  Seinigen  so  natürlich \nvorstellen  zu  sehen.  Ein  Gelächter  und  Gejauchze  von \nAnfang  bis  zu  Ende.  Ich  muß  aber  auch  gestehen,  daß \ndie  Schauspieler  es  vortrefflich  machten.  Sie  hatten  sich, \nnach  Anlage  der  Charaktere,  in  die  verschiedenen  Stim- \nmen geteilt,  welche  unter  dem  Volk  gewöhnlich  vorkom- \nmen. Die  erste  Aktrice  war  allerliebst,  viel  besser  als  neu- \nlich in  Heldentracht  und  Leidenschaft.  Die  Frauen  über- \nhaupt, besonders  aber  diese,  ahmten  Stimme,  Gebärden \nund  Wesen  des  Volks  aufs  anmutigste  nach.  Großes  Lob \nverdient  der  Verfasser,  der  aus  nichts  den  angenehmsten \nZeitvertreib  gel)ildet  hat.  Das  kann  man  aber  auch  nur \nunmittelbar  seinem  eignen  lebenslustigen  Volk.  Es  ist \ndurchaus  mit  einer  geübten  Hand  geschrieben. \nVon  der  Truppe  Sacchi,  für  welche  Gozzi  arbeitete  und \ndie  übrigens  zerstreut  ist,  habe  ich  die  Smeraldina  ge- \nsehen, eine  kleine,  dicke  Figur,  voller  Leben,  Gewandt- \nheit und  guten  Humors.  Mit  ihr  sah  ich  den  }3righella, \neinen  hagem,  wohlgebauten,  besonders  in  Mienen-  und \nHändespiel  trefilichen  Schauspieler.    Diese  Masken,  die \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  loi \n\nwir  fast  nur  als  Mumien  kennen,  da  sie  für  uns  weder \nLeben  noch  Bedeutung  haben,  tun  hier  gar  zu  wohl,  als \nGeschöpfe  dieser  Landschaft.  Die  ausgezeichneten  Alter, \nCharaktere  und  Stände  haben  sich  in  wunderlichen  Klei- \ndern verkörpert,  und  wenn  man  selbst  den  größten  Teil \ndes  Jahrs  mit  der  Maske  herumläuft,  so  findet  man  nichts \nnatürlicher,  als  daß  da  droben  auch  schwarze  Gesichter \nerscheinen. \n\nDen  II.  Oktober. \n\nUnd  weil  die  Einsamkeit  in  einer  so  großen  Menschen- \nmasse denn  doch  zuletzt  nicht  recht  möglich  sein  will, \nso  bin  ich  mit  einem  alten  Franzosen  zusammengekom- \nmen, der  kein  Italienisch  kann,  sich  wie  verraten  und \nverkauft  fühlt  und,  mit  allen  Empfehlungsschreiben,  doch \nnicht  recht  weiß,  woran  er  ist.  Ein  Mann  von  Stande, \nsehr  guter  Lebensart,  der  aber  nicht  aus  sich  heraus  kann; \ner  mag  stark  in  den  Funfzigen  sein  und  hat  zu  Hause  einen \nsiebenjährigen  Knaben,  von  dem  er  bänglich  Nachrichten \nerwartet.  Ich  habe  ihm  einige  Gefälligkeiten  erzeigt;  er \nreist  durch  Italien  bequem,  aber  geschwind,  um  es  doch \neinmal  gesehen  zu  haben,  und  mag  sich  gern  im  Vorbei- \ngehen so  viel  wie  möglich  unterrichten;  ich  gebe  ihm \nAuskunft  über  manches.  Als  ich  mit  ihm  von  Venedig \nsprach,  fragte  er  mich,  wie  lange  ich  hier  sei,  und  als  er \nhörte,  nur  vierzehn  Tage  und  zum  erstenmal,  versetzte \ner:  II  parait  que  vous  n'avez  pas  perdu  votre  temps.  Das \nist  das  erste  Testimonium  meines  Wohlverhaltens,  das \nich  aufweisen  kann.  Er  ist  nun  acht  Tage  hier  und \ngeht  morgen  fort.  Es  war  mir  köstlich,  einen  recht  ein- \ngefleischten Versailler  in  der  Fremde  zu  sehen.  Der \nreist  nun  auch!  und  ich  betrachtete  mit  Erstaunen,  wie \nman  reisen  kann,  ohne  etwas  außer  sich  gewahr  zu  wer- \nden; und  er  ist  in  seiner  Art  ein  recht  gebildeter,  wackrer, \nordentlicher  Mann. \n\nDen  12.  Oktober. \nGestern  gaben  sie  zu  St.  Lukas  ein  neues  Stück:  LTngli- \ncismo  in  Italia.    Da  viele  Engländer  in  Italien  leben,  so \n\n\nI02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nist  es  natürlich,  daß  ihre  Sitten  bemerkt  werden,  und \nich  dachte  hier  zu  erfahren,  wie  die  ItaHener  diese  rei- \nchen und  ihnen  so  willkommenen  Gäste  betrachten;  aber \nes  war  ganz  und  gar  nichts.  Einige  glückliche  Narren- \nszenen, wie  immer,  das  übrige  aber  zu  schwer  und  ernst- \nlich gemeint,  und  denn  doch  keine  Spur  von  englischem \nSinn;  die  gewöhnlichen  italienischen  sittlichen  Gemein- \nsprüche, und  auch  nur  auf  das  Gemeinste  gerichtet. \nAuch  gefiel  es  nicht  und  war  auf  dem  Punkt,  ausgepfiffen \nzu  werden;  die  Schauspieler  fühlten  sich  nicht  in  ihrem \nElemente,  nicht  auf  dem  Platze  von  Chiozza.  Da  dies \ndas  letzte  Stück  ist,  was  ich  hier  sehe,  so  scheint  es,  mein \nEnthusiasmus  für  jene  Nationalrepräsentation  sollte  noch \ndurch  diese  Folie  erhöht  werden. \n\nNachdem  ich  zum  Schluß  mein  Tagebuch  durchgegangen, \nkleine  Schreibtafelbemerkungen  eingeschaltet,  so  sollen \ndie  Akten  inrotuliert  und  den  Freunden  zum  Urteils- \nspruch zugeschickt  werden.  Schon  jetzt  finde  ich  man- \nches in  diesen  Blättern,  das  ich  näher  bestimmen,  er- \nweitern und  verbessern  könnte;  es  mag  stehen  als  Denk- \nmal des  ersten  Eindrucks,  der,  wenn  er  auch  nicht  immer \nwahr  wäre,  uns  doch  köstlich  und  wert  bleibt.  Könnte \nich  nur  den  Freunden  einen  Hauch  dieser  leichtern  Exi- \nstenz hinübersenden!  Jawohl  ist  dem  Italiener  das  Ultra- \nmontane eine  dunkle  Vorstellung,  auch  mir  kommt  das \nJenseits  der  Alpen  nun  düster  vor;  doch  winken  freund- \nliche Gestalten  immer  aus  dem  Nebel.  Nur  das  Klima \nwürde  mich  reizen,  diese  Gegenden  jenen  vorzuziehen; \ndenn  Geburt  und  Gewohnheit  sind  mächtige  Fesseln.  Ich \nmöchte  hier  nicht  leben,  wie  überall  an  keinem  Orte,  wo  ich \nunbeschäftigt  wäre;  jetzt  macht  mir  das  Neue  unendlich \nviel  zu  Schäften.  Die  Baukunst  steigt  wie  ein  alter  Geist \naus  dem  Grabe  hervor,  sie  heißt  mich  ihre  Lehren,  wie \ndie  Regeln  einer  ausgestorbenen  Sprache,  studieren, \nnicht  um  sie  auszuüben  oder  mich  in  ihr  lebendig  zu \nerfreuen,  sondern  nur  um  die  ehrwürdige,  für  ewig  ab- \ngeschiedene Existenz  der  vergangenen  Zeitalter  in  einem \nstillen  Gemüte  zu  verehren.    Da  Palladio  alles  auf  Vitruv \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  103 \n\nbezieht,  so  habe  ich  mir  auch  die  Ausgabe  des  Galiani \nangeschaftt:  allein  dieser  Foliante  lastet  in  meinem  Ge- \npäck wie  das  Studium  desselben  auf  meinem  Gehirn. \nPalladio  hat  mir  durch  seine  Worte  und  Werke,  durch \nseine  Art  und  Weise  des  Denkens  und  Schaffens  den \nVitruv  schon  näher  gebracht  und  verdolmetscht,  besser \nals  die  italienische  Übersetzung  tun  kann.  Vitruv  liest \nsich  nicht  so  leicht;  das  Buch  ist  an  sich  schon  düster \ngeschrieben  und  fordert  ein  kritisches  Studium.  Dem- \nohngeachtet  lese  ich  es  flüchtig  durch,  und  es  bleibt  mir \nmancher  würdige  Eindruck.  Besser  zu  sagen:  ich  lese \nes  wie  ein  Brevier,  mehr  aus  Andacht  als  zur  Belehrung. \nSchon  bricht  die  Nacht  zeitiger  ein  und  gibt  Raum  zum \nLesen  imd  Schreiben. \n\nGott  sei  Dank,  wie  mir  alles  wieder  lieb  wird,  was  mir \nvon  Jugend  auf  wert  war!  Wie  glücklich  befinde  ich  mich, \ndaß  ich  den  alten  Schriftstellern  wieder  näher  zu  treten \nwage!  Denn  jetzt  darf  ich  es  sagen,  darf  meine  Krank- \nheit und  Torheit  bekennen.  Schon  einige  Jahre  her  dürft' \nich  keinen  lateinischen  Autor  ansehen,  nichts  betrachten, \nwas  mir  ein  Bild  Italiens  erneute.  Geschah  es  zufällig, \nso  erduldete  ich  die  entsetzlichsten  Schmerzen.  Herder \nspottete  oft  über  mich,  daß  ich  all  mein  Latein  aus  dem \nSpinoza  lerne;  denn  er  hatte  bemerkt,  daß  dies  das  einzige \nlateinische  Buch  war,  das  ich  las:  er  wußte  aber  nicht,  wie \nsehr  ich  mich  vor  den  Alten  hüten  mußte,  wie  ich  mich  in \njene  abstrusen  Allgemeinheiten  nur  ängstlich  flüchtete. \nNoch  zuletzt  hat  mich  die  Wielandsche  Übersetzung  der \nSatiren  höchst  unglücklich  gemacht:  ich  hatte  kaum  zwei \ngelesen,  so  war  ich  schon  verrückt. \nHätte  ich  nicht  den  Entschluß  gefaßt,  den  ich  jetzt  aus- \nführe, so  war'  ich  rein  zugrunde  gegangen:  zu  einer  sol- \nchen Reife  war  die  Begierde,  diese  Gegenstände  mit \nAugen  zu  sehen,  in  meinem  Gemüt  gestiegen.  Die  histo- \nrische Kenntnis  fördert  mich  nicht:  die  Dinge  standen \nnur  eine  Handbreit  von  mir  ab,  aber  durch  eine  undurch- \ndringliche Mauer  geschieden.  Es  ist  mir  wirklich  auch \njetzt  nicht  etwa  zumute,  als  wenn  ich  die  Sachen  zum \nerstenmal  sähe,  sondern  als  ob  ich  sie  wiedersähe.    Ich \n\n\nI04  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nbin  nur  kurze  Zeit  in  Venedig  und  habe  mir  die  hiesige \nExistenz  genugsam  zugeeignet  und  weiß,  daß  ich,  wenn \nauch  einen  unvollständigen,  doch  einen  ganz  klaren  und \nwahren  Begrifi\"  mit  wegnehme. \n\nVenedig,  den  14.  Oktober,  2  Stundeti  in  der  Nacht. \nIn  den  letzten  Augenblicken  meines  Hierseins:  denn  es \ngeht  sogleich  mit  dem  Kurierschifte  nach  Ferrara.  Ich \nverlasse  Venedig  gern;  denn  um  mit  Vergnügen  und \nNutzen  zu  bleiben,  müßte  ich  andere  Schritte  tun,  die \naußer  meinem  Plan  liegen;  auch  verläßt  jedermann  nun \ndiese  Stadt  und  sucht  seine  Garten  und  Besitzungen \nauf  dem  festen  Lande.  Ich  habe  indes  gut  aufgeladen \nund  trage  das  reiche,  sonderbare,  einzige  Bild  mit  mir \nfort. \n\n\n--- [ID: e903f4eb-27d0-4022-9799-beb412688474] GOETHES_Excerpt ---\n[HOW TO USE]: Here is the excerpt text that must be augmented\nDen 3. Oktober. Die Kirche Il Redentore, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will. Er war unzufrieden, wie ich aus gelinder Wendung seines Buches schließe, daß man bei christlichen Kirchen nach der Form der alten Basiliken zu bauen fortfahre, er suchte deshalb seine heiligen Gebäude der alten Tempelform zu nähern; daher entstanden gewisse Unschicklichkeiten, die mir bei Il Redentore glücklich beseitigt, bei St. Giorgio aber zu auffallend erscheinen. Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf. Inwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren.   Den 3. Oktober. Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen. Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.   Den 3. Oktober. Den Plan in der Hand suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld. Es wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 pages story in english that enhance the event :[GOETHES_Excerpt], keep everything already present and build around it.

      "content": "**Den 3. Oktober.**\n\nDer Tag brach an, getrübt von einem unbeständigen Sirocco, der die Lagune seit dem Morgen in eine unruhige Fläche verwandelte. Doch auch dieser Wind, der auf dem Gardasee noch Tage zuvor nur ein sanftes Schwellen erzeugt hatte, konnte meine Entschlossenheit nicht trüben, die Bauten Palladios in ihrer vollen Pracht zu erfassen. Mein erster Weg führte mich zur Kirche **Il Redentore**, einem Werk, das ich in seinen Rissen und Stichen so oft betrachtet hatte, und dessen Anblick nun die Erwartungen übertraf, die Volkmanns nüchterne Beschreibungen in mir geweckt hatten.\n\nSchon die Fahrt über den Giudecca-Kanal war ein Schauspiel für sich. Die Gondel, deren schwarzer Bug die aufgewühlten Wellen schnitt, tanzte leicht auf dem Wasser. Der Wind peitschte Gischt gegen die niedrigen Ufermauern, und das helle Weiß der Kirchenfassade spiegelte sich in tausend flackernden Reflexen im unruhigen Nass. Es war, als ob das statische Bauwerk selbst zu leben begann, seine strengen Linien im Spiel des Lichts und der Bewegung der See aufgehoben. Volkmann hatte die Kirche als eine „Treppe von siebzehn Stufen“ beschrieben, die zum Portikus führe – eine trockene, messbare Tatsache. Doch nun, da die Flut hoch stand und der Wind das Wasser gegen die unteren Stufen branden ließ, schienen diese Zahlen in der lebendigen Realität fast bedeutungslos. Ich zählte sie dennoch, als ich aus der Gondel stieg und die nassen, glitschigen Steine betrat, die zum eigentlichen Eingang führten.\n\nDie Fassade des Redentore, ein Meisterwerk Palladios, leuchtete mir entgegen. Volkmanns Bericht hatte die „Majestät“ und die Ähnlichkeit mit römischen Tempeln gelobt, ohne die subtile Genialität der Konstruktion wirklich zu erfassen. Doch mein Auge, geschult durch Palladios eigene Schriften, erkannte hier die glücklich gelöste Spannung. Die hohe, zentrale Giebelordnung, die die Breite des Hauptschiffs umfasste, schien sich harmonisch mit der niedrigeren, breiteren Ordnung der Seitenschiffe zu verschränken, die dahinter zurückzutreten schien. Kein Bruch, keine Disharmonie, wie ich sie später am San Giorgio Maggiore so deutlich wahrnehmen sollte, wo die hohen Sockel der Mittelsäulen eine unangenehme Stelzenwirkung erzeugten. Hier war alles Einheit, ein Fluss von Formen, der das Auge beruhigte und den Geist erhob.\n\nDoch die größte Überraschung offenbarte sich bei näherer Betrachtung der Materialität. Der makellose Glanz, den ich aus den Kupferstichen kannte, war eine Illusion. Nicht edler Marmor, sondern „gebrannter Ton“ – Ziegel und Stuck – bildeten den Großteil der Substanz. Nur die Kapitelle, Basen und Schlusssteine waren aus behauenem Stein. Ich trat an die Wand, und meine Finger spürten die feine Rauheit des verputzten Ziegels unter der weißen Farbe. Es war, als würde Venedig selbst, diese Stadt der schillernden Masken und versteckten Realitäten, sein wahres Gesicht offenbaren: eine Schönheit, die nicht aus ewiger Masse, sondern aus genialer Proportion und geschickter Verkleidung entstand. Das Wissen um diese Fragilität, um die Notwendigkeit, solch ein grandioses Werk mit begrenzten Mitteln zu errichten, verlieh dem Bau eine neue, menschlichere Dimension.\n\n**Die Kirche Il Redentore**, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will.

Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf.\n\nInwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren. Der Übergang von der erhabenen Architektur zur Innenausstattung war abrupt und verriet eine andere Art von „Betrug“. Der weite, lichte Innenraum, Palladios klare Linien, die an antike Basiliken erinnerten, wurden von einer ganz eigenen, volkstümlichen Frömmigkeit überlagert.\n\n**Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren** hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen.\n\nEs war der Vorabend des Festes des Heiligen Franziskus, des Gründers der Kapuziner, und die Mönche waren eifrig damit beschäftigt, das Gotteshaus für die morgige Feier zu schmücken. Der Kontrast zwischen der hohen Kunst Palladios und der „Arte Povera“ der Kapuziner war frappierend. Die Nischen, die Palladio für edle Marmorstatuen vorgesehen hatte, waren nun mit diesen „flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren“ gefüllt, die aus einfachem Holz oder dickem Karton gefertigt und mit lebhaften, oft naiven Farben bemalt waren. Der Seitenaltar, der dem Heiligen Franziskus gewidmet war, war eine Explosion barocker Volkskunst. Was aus der Ferne wie reiche Goldstickerei auf kostbarem Stoff aussah, entpuppte sich bei näherem Hinsehen als kunstvoll verarbeitetes Stroh. Breitgedrückt und sorgfältig auf Papier geklebt, imitierte es das Schimmern von Goldfäden in arabeskenartigen Mustern, die sich über die Säulen und den Altaraufbau zogen. Die „goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke“ waren aus gefärbtem Stroh gewebt, das mit erstaunlicher Geschicklichkeit die Illusion von Prunk erzeugte. Der Grund war mit leuchtenden Farben bemalt, um die Wirkung zu verstärken. Dieser „hübsche Betrug“ war ein Zeugnis der Frömmigkeit und des handwerklichen Geschicks der Mönche, die mit den bescheidensten Mitteln eine beeindruckende, wenn auch für mein klassisches Auge etwas befremdliche, Pracht schufen. Der Geruch von Weihrauch, der sich mit den erdigen Noten von Zypressen und den würzigen Düften von Artischocken aus dem angrenzenden Klostergarten mischte, erfüllte die Luft und verband die geistliche Atmosphäre mit der bodenständigen Realität der Giudecca.\n\nNachdem ich die Kirche verlassen hatte, trieb mich meine Neugier weiter.\n\n**Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers** bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.\n\nDieser „geringe Kerl“, ein *improvisatore*, stand auf einem umgedrehten Fass auf der Riva degli Schiavoni, unweit des geschäftigen Treibens. Die Riva war eine Ader Venedigs, wo sich das bunte Leben der Stadt verdichtete: Schiavoni, die slawischen Seeleute und Kaufleute aus Dalmatien, mit ihren roten Mützen und langen Pfeifen, mischten sich unter griechische Händler und türkische Matrosen. Der Geruch von gerösteten Maronen und frittiertem Fisch, der von den Ständen der *frittole* aufstieg, vermischte sich mit dem salzigen Hauch der Lagune und dem herben Geruch von Teer, der von den Werften herüberwehte. Der Geschichtenerzähler, ein Erbe der Commedia dell'arte, nutzte den Kai als seine Bühne. Seine Gesten waren groß, theatralisch, seine Stimme moduliert, um die Aufmerksamkeit der vorbeiziehenden Menge zu fesseln. Obwohl ich den venezianischen Dialekt, sein *Veneziano*, kaum verstand, konnte ich die Resonanz seiner Worte in den Gesichtern der Zuhörer ablesen. Sie lachten nicht offen, wie man es bei einer Komödie erwartet hätte, doch ein stilles Schmunzeln, ein Nicken, ein gespanntes Innehalten verriet ihre tiefe Verbundenheit mit den „alten Legenden“, die er zum Besten gab. Es waren Geschichten von Venedigs glorreicher Vergangenheit, von Siegen gegen die Türken, von legendären Dogen und wundersamen Ereignissen, durchsetzt mit volkstümlichen Weisheiten und einer Prise Buffonerie. Der Erzähler war nicht nur ein Geschichtenerzähler, sondern ein Bewahrer der mündlichen Tradition, der die Geschichte Venedigs nicht mit trockenen Fakten, sondern mit Emotionen und Dialekt zum Leben erweckte. Die Menge, die sich um ihn scharte, bestand hauptsächlich aus einfachen Leuten, Handwerkern, Fischern und Gondolieri, die sich nach einem langen Tag nach Unterhaltung sehnten.\n\n**Den 3. Oktober.**\n**Den Plan in der Hand** suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld.\n\nDie *Ospedali Grandi* waren eine jener einzigartigen venezianischen Institutionen, die mich immer wieder faszinierten. Waisenhäuser, die zu Musikschulen für junge Frauen geworden waren, deren virtuose Darbietungen weithin berühmt waren. Die Kirche San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti, an der Fondamente Nove gelegen, war an diesem Abend bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt. Ein Publikum aus Venezianern und neugierigen Fremden lauschte andächtig den Klängen, die von der Empore herabstiegen. Ich fand einen Platz in der Nähe des Altars und blickte hinauf zum Gitter, das die Musikerinnen, die *figlie di coro*, vor den Blicken der Welt verbarg. Die Musik war in der Tat „sehr schön“, ein galanter, melodischer Stil, der an die Oper erinnerte, doch hier in der sakralen Umgebung eine erhabene Reinheit besaß.\n\nDas Oratorium, so erfuhr ich von einem freundlichen Nachbarn, war „Saul“ von Ferdinando Bertoni, dem Maestro di Cappella der Mendicanti und des Markusdoms. Es war ein Werk von großer dramatischer Kraft, gesungen in einem „italianisierten“ Latein, das tatsächlich an manchen Stellen ein Lächeln hervorlockte – eine charmante Eigenheit, die dem ernsten Text eine gewisse Leichtigkeit verlieh. Doch es war die Stimme des Alt, der die Rolle des Königs Saul sang, die mich am meisten in ihren Bann zog. Eine Stimme, wie ich sie noch nie zuvor gehört hatte: tief, kräftig, von einer solchen Resonanz, dass sie das gesamte Kirchenschiff erfüllte. Es war „ein wunderliches Neutrum“, wie ich es mir später notierte, eine weibliche Stimme, die die tragische Männlichkeit eines biblischen Königs verkörperte. Diese akustische Maskerade, die Umkehrung des Kastratenphänomens, war zutiefst venezianisch und faszinierte mich in ihrer kühnen künstlerischen Freiheit.\n\nEs wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.\n\nTatsächlich war der musikalische Genuss, so erhaben er auch war, durch eine wiederkehrende Störung getrübt. Von irgendwo hinter dem Gitter, wo die Musikerinnen verborgen waren, ertönte in regelmäßigen Abständen ein trockenes, scharfes „Klack-Klack-Klack“. Es war der Kapellmeister, wahrscheinlich Bertoni selbst, der mit einer gerollten Notenrolle den Takt auf das Metallgitter schlug. Dieses „unverschämte“ Geräusch, das mich an die grobe Disziplin eines Schulmeisters erinnerte, der seine Zöglinge zurechtweist, war völlig unnötig. Die Mädchen waren offenbar meisterhaft in ihrem Handwerk, und die Musik floss makellos dahin. Doch dieser „fremde Schall“ zerschnitt die ätherische Schönheit des Oratoriums, riss mich aus der musikalischen Trance und erinnerte mich brutal an die materielle Wirklichkeit, an die strenge Hand, die diese himmlischen Stimmen führte. Es war, als würde man einem Gemälde mit einem unpassenden, groben Pinselstrich begegnen – eine unliebsame Störung, die die Illusion zerbrach und die Harmonie aufhob. Doch das Publikum schien es gewohnt, ja es schien diese Eigenart als Teil des Erlebnisses zu akzeptieren, eine weitere Facette der venezianischen Vorliebe für das Theatralische, selbst wenn es den Genuss zu mindern schien. Ich schüttelte den Kopf, innerlich verwundert über diese seltsame Mischung aus höchster Kunst und unbeholfener Realität.",

Introduction: Simulation Parameters and Temporal Convergence\n\n1.1 Source Triangulation and Methodology\n\nTo accurately simulate the \"spirit\" of the city and that of the observer on October 3, 1786, it is imperative to understand the dynamic interaction between these three major documentary corpora:\nJohann Jacob Volkmann (Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien): This constitutes the static knowledge base. In 1786, a cultivated German traveler like Goethe did not discover Italy with a blank slate; he perceived it through the prism of Volkmann.3 The latter provides the \"expected\" data—dimensions of churches, attribution of artworks, standardized critiques. In the simulation, Volkmann represents the \"common knowledge\" or the encyclopedic layer of the AI's world model.\nAndrea Palladio (I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura): He defines the structural and theoretical reality. Palladio's texts and buildings form the rigid physical constraints of the simulation. His theories on temple facades and antique \"purity\" dictate the aesthetic norms against which the Venetian reality is judged by the observer.5\nCarlo Goldoni (Memoirs): He embodies the dynamic social layer. Goldoni offers the authentic Venetian voice, the dialect, the bustling life of the quays, and the theatricality of St. Mark's Square. Where Goethe is the critical observer, Goldoni provides the \"script\" for NPCs (Non-Player Characters)—the gondoliers, street storytellers (improvisatori), and masks populating the Riva degli Schiavoni.7\n\n1.2 Chronological Anchoring: The Eve of St. Francis\n\nThe date of October 3 is critical for the simulation's coherence. It is the eve of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi (October 4). This liturgical detail explains the specific activity Goethe witnesses at the Church of Il Redentore (Capuchins decorating the altar). Furthermore, this places the simulation in a moment of autumnal meteorological transition: the wind that \"swelled\" on Lake Garda days earlier has become a blustery sirocco in the lagoon, affecting water texture and crowd behavior.3\n\n2. The Epistemological Framework: The Volkmann Guide as Cognitive Filter\n\nBefore the simulation generates a visual description, it must establish the cognitive filter through which the user (or simulated agent) processes information. This filter is Johann Jacob Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien, a work omnipresent in the luggage of Grand Tour travelers of the late 18th century.\n\n2.1 The Nature of the Volkmann Source\n\nVolkmann's work is not a simple modern tourist guide; it is a scholarly compilation, often dry, largely based on Jérôme Lalande's Voyage d'un François en Italie.3 For the simulation, this implies that any \"factual\" information provided by the AI must initially reflect Volkmann's style and content: precise, meticulous, but sometimes lacking direct artistic sensitivity.\nVolkmann's text structures the observer's expectation. When approaching a monument like Il Redentore, he does not see it \"naively\"; he compares it to the description read the night before. Goethe himself engages in a constant, sometimes conflicting, dialogue with this text. He explicitly notes: \"Volkmann says something about this, but does not hit the nail on the head\" (trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf).9 This critique mechanism is essential for the simulation: the AI must not only state facts but simulate the process of intellectual verification and correction performed by the enlightened traveler.\n\n2.2 Specific Data for Simulation\n\nVolkmann's report contains granular details that must be integrated as \"ground truths\" (or errors to be corrected) in the simulation.\nMeasurements: Volkmann is obsessed with dimensions. For the Redentore, he specifically mentions a \"staircase of seventeen steps\" (eine Treppe von siebzehn Stufen) leading to the portico.11 This numerical detail must be physically present in the spatial modeling of the scene.\nCritical Perspective: Volkmann describes the interior of Il Redentore and San Giorgio with competent but conventional admiration. He praises the \"majesty\" and resemblance to Roman temples without necessarily grasping the theoretical subtlety of the intersecting pediments that Goethe identifies through his reading of Palladio.11\nAspect\nDescription in Volkmann (Expectation)\nGoethe's Observation (Simulated Reality)\nImplication for Simulation\nGeneral Tone\nDescriptive, encyclopedic, dry.\nCritical, aesthetic, sensory.\nAI must use Volkmann for raw facts, and Goethe for qualitative judgment.\nIl Redentore\nMentions the 17 steps, Roman temple aspect.\nNotes the success of façade harmony, brick materiality.\nThe user must \"count\" the steps but \"feel\" the harmony.\nSan Giorgio\nStandard description.\nSevere critique of disproportion (pedestals).\nMarked contrast between admiration for Redentore and disdain for San Giorgio.\n\n\n3. The Architectural Scene: Palladio and the Problem of the Façade\n\nThe core of the visual experience on October 3, 1786, lies in the confrontation with Palladio's two masterpieces visible from the St. Mark's Basin: the church of Il Redentore (The Redeemer) and San Giorgio Maggiore. The simulation must account not only for their appearance but for the theoretical tension they embody.\n\n3.1 The Theory of Intersection in Palladio\n\nTo understand what Goethe sees, the simulation must integrate the principles set forth in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570). Palladio faced a fundamental adaptation problem: how to apply the form of an antique Roman temple (designed for a single rectangular cella with a single pediment) to a Christian basilica (which possesses a high central nave and lower side aisles).6\nIf the architect applies a single giant pediment, the side aisles remain uncovered or the roof must be awkwardly lowered. The solution developed by Palladio, which the simulation must visualize, is the illusion of interlocking temple fronts.\n\n3.1.1 Il Redentore: Resolved Harmony\n\nOn the island of Giudecca, Il Redentore is perceived by Goethe as the absolute success of this theory. The façade must be described in the simulation as a complex superposition of geometric planes:\nThe Major Order: A high central pediment, supported by semi-columns, corresponding to the nave.\nThe Minor Order: A wider and lower pediment (suggested by pilasters and roof fragments) corresponding to the aisles and appearing to pass \"behind\" the major order.\nThe Attic: A rectangular attic wall rising behind the central pediment, recalling the Pantheon in Rome.6\nGoethe considers that Palladio has here \"happily avoided\" (glücklich beseitigt) the inconsistencies plaguing other buildings.2 The dominant impression generated by the simulation must be one of white, resolved serenity.\n\n3.1.2 San Giorgio Maggiore: The Failed Experiment\n\nIn direct contrast, the church of San Giorgio Maggiore (on its own island) represents for the observer of October 3 a less successful attempt, or a relative failure.\nThe Structural Flaw: Goethe's critique, implicitly supported by a close reading of Palladio, concerns the treatment of the bases. at San Giorgio, the central columns of the major order rest on high pedestals, while the lateral pilasters start from the ground. This creates a visual rupture, giving the impression that the central part is \"on stilts\" or disconnected from the rest.11\nImplication for Simulation: When the user looks toward San Giorgio, the description should not be purely laudatory. It must integrate this aesthetic unease: an impression of being \"too striking\" (zu auffallend) or dislocated, contrasting with the organic unity of Il Redentore.9\n\n3.2 Materiality Revealed: Brick and Stucco vs. Stone\n\nA crucial sensory detail emerges on October 3, transforming the perception of the monument. Goethe, approaching Il Redentore, makes a discovery that deconstructs the myth of \"marble Venice.\"\nThe Observation: \"Only the capitals and bases of the columns, and the keystones of the arches, are of hewn stone; all the rest is... of burnt clay\" (gebranntem Ton).1\nThe Illusion of Whiteness: The simulation must reveal that Palladio's immaculate whiteness is a skin. Beneath the stucco and whitewash hides the brick. Goethe notes even \"the frieze and cornice\" are terracotta.\nFragility: This observation lends the building unexpected fragility. It is not an eternal monolith, but an assembly of \"bricks\" held together by the genius of proportions rather than the mass of noble stone. The simulation must allow the user to virtually \"touch\" the wall and feel the texture of stucco covering the brick, emphasizing the theme of Venetian illusion.\n\n3.3 The Dynamic Environment: The Giudecca Canal\n\nThe approach to these buildings does not occur on stable ground. The simulation must famously account for the state of the lagoon that day. The wind, which was already swelling on Lake Garda, is here an autumnal sirocco agitating the Giudecca Canal.\nVisual Effects: Water laps against the steps of Il Redentore (Volkmann's famous 17 steps). The church façade reflects in agitated water, creating a \"flickering\" or \"mirage\" effect, rendering Palladio's geometric lines moving and unstable.15\nPhysical Effects: The observer in a gondola must constantly compensate for the movement of the waves (\"loftier billows\"), making the contemplation of static architecture physically dynamic and precarious.16\n\n4. The Capuchin Context: Ephemeral, Arte Povera, and Devotion\n\nOnce the threshold of Il Redentore is crossed, the simulation must shift from cold architectural analysis to a warm sociological and religious experience. The church is managed by the Capuchin Friars Minor, an order dedicated to poverty, creating an immediate visual tension with Palladio's grandiose classicism.\n\n4.1 The Feast of St. Francis (The Transitus)\n\nThe evening of October 3 marks the celebration of the Transitus of St. Francis of Assisi (his death), a prelude to his feast on October 4. The simulation must show a church in full preparatory bustle. Monks are active, transforming the sacred space.[34]\n\n4.2 The Altar of Arte Povera: Straw Marquetry and Cardboard\n\nGoethe describes with a mixture of fascination and aesthetic horror a side altar \"powerfully decorated\" (mächtig ausgeputzt) in honor of the saint.9\nThe Visual Shock: Amidst the Corinthian columns and the rational light of Palladio's thermal windows, the observer discovers a baroque explosion of poor materials. Goethe speaks of \"flat, cut-out, painted board figures\" (flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren).9\nSpecific Technique: Historical research clarifies what Goethe perceives as simple boards. This is most likely straw marquetry (straw marquetry) and card work, artisanal techniques in which Venetian religious orders excelled.17 Dyed straw was used to imitate gold, precious wood, or silk, creating complex geometric or floral patterns.\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must generate detailed descriptions of these ephemeral decorations: fake cardboard golden halos, dummy painted wood columns, woven straw flowers. These objects must appear both \"ridiculous\" to Goethe's neoclassical eye and touching in their artisanal ingenuity.\nThe Problem of Niches: Goethe particularly deplores that the niches designed by Palladio to house noble stone statues are filled with these flat, colored figures.9 It is the triumph of devout \"bad taste\" over architectural \"grand taste.\"\n\n4.3 The Capuchin Garden (Hortus Redemptoris)\n\nAlthough Goethe focuses on the interior, the spatial context includes the vast convent garden located just behind the church.18\nSensory Data: This garden provided food and simples (medicinal herbs) for the friars. The simulation must integrate an olfactory component: the smell of feast-day incense mingles with scents of cypress, artichokes, and aromatic herbs from the garden, as well as the brackish smell of the lagoon. This anchors the user in the biological reality of Giudecca Island, beyond stone and brick.\n\n5. The Soundscape: The Ospedale dei Mendicanti and Gender Inversion\n\nLeaving the visual experience of Il Redentore, the simulation must orchestrate a major auditory experience located at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti. It is here that the musical singularity of 18th-century Venice crystallizes.\n\n5.1 The Institution: San Lazzaro e dei Mendicanti\n\nVenice had four Ospedali Grandi, charitable institutions for orphans that became renowned music conservatories for women.20 The Mendicanti, located on the Fondamente Nove, is the setting for the event of October 3.\nThe Performers: The figlie di coro (daughters of the choir). These young women lived in seclusion but gave public concerts of formidable technical virtuosity.\nThe Grille (Grata): The interior architecture of the church (San Lazzaro) imposes strict separation. The audience (including Goethe) is in the nave, while the musicians are invisible or partially concealed behind an ornate metal grille in the gallery.21 This visual separation is fundamental for the simulation: the music is acousmatic, descending from above, \"angelic\" but disembodied.\n\n5.2 The Repertoire: The Oratorio Saul by Bertoni\n\nSource analysis allows identifying the specific work with near certainty. It is the oratorio \"Saul\" (or potentially L'obbedienza di Gionata) composed by Ferdinando Bertoni.23\nThe Composer: Ferdinando Bertoni (1725–1813) was Maestro di Cappella at the Mendicanti and St. Mark's. His style is galant, melodic, close to opera seria, far from severe polyphony.26\nThe Oratorio: The work is sung in Latin, but with a \"dulcified pronunciation\" in the Italian style that Goethe notes (\"so Italian-Latin that one must laugh in places\").27\nVocal Inversion: The focal point of the experience is the alto soloist singing the role of King Saul. Goethe describes this voice as \"a strange, neutral thing\" (ein wunderliches Neutrum).28\nImplication for Simulation: The AI must describe this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance typical of the Venetian 18th century. The user hears a female voice (likely a contralto with dark, powerful timbre) embodying the masculine tragic fury of a biblical king. It is the exact inversion of the castrato phenomenon on opera stages: here, femininity is masked to produce biblical virility.\n\n5.3 The \"Cursed\" Kapellmeister\n\nA specific interactive detail, reported by Goethe, must be included to break the musical perfection.\nThe Incident: The conductor (likely Bertoni himself or his assistant) beats time against the metal grille with a roll of sheet music (Rolle Noten).\nThe Parasitic Noise: Goethe characterizes this noise as \"impudent\" (unverschämt) and \"clacking\" (klappend). He notes that it ruins the musical illusion.22\nSimulation Trigger: In the sound simulation, the vocal perfection of the figlie must be rhythmically punctuated by this dry, mechanical clack-clack-clack of paper against iron. This detail symbolizes the intrusion of rigid discipline and material reality into the ethereal sphere of art.\n\n6. The Street Narrative: Goldoni, Dialect, and the Riva\n\nLeaving sacred spaces, the simulation moves to the Riva degli Schiavoni (Quay of the Slavs), where the city's language shifts from Latin/German (Palladio/Goethe) to Venetian dialect (Goldoni).\n\n6.1 The Riva degli Schiavoni: The Cosmopolitan Quay\n\nThis is the city's vital artery, stretching east from the Doge's Palace.\nDemographics: The name refers to the Schiavoni (Slavs/Dalmatians), merchants and sailors from the eastern Adriatic who formed a significant part of the Venetian maritime workforce.29 The simulation must populate this zone with distinct costumes, red caps, long pipes, and a linguistic mix (Venetian, Greek, Turkish, Slavic).\nAtmosphere: Unlike the silence of Giudecca, the Riva is noisy, commercial, and chaotic. It smells of roasted chestnuts, fried fish (sold by frittole), and caulking tar.30\n\n6.2 The Storyteller (Improvisatore) and Goldoni's Legacy\n\nGoethe explicitly mentions the presence of a storyteller on the quay on October 3. This figure is the direct link to the universe of Carlo Goldoni.\nThe Performance: The storyteller is not a man of letters but a street artist, heir to the Commedia dell'arte. He likely stands on a crate or rug, using broad theatrical gestures to hold the crowd.\nThe Content: Goethe mentions \"old legends.\" In the Goldonian context, this is a mix of mythologized Venetian history (victories against Turks, legendary Doges) and popular buffoonery.31\nThe Goldoni Connection: Although Carlo Goldoni is in Paris (writing his Memoirs published the following year, 1787), his spirit structures this scene. Goldoni spent his career trying to \"reform\" this type of theater, seeking to replace the vulgar improvisation of masks with written texts and realistic characters.8\nSimulation Dynamics: The storyteller represents the oral and emotional history of Venice. Where Volkmann gives written history (dates, names), the storyteller offers felt history (emotion, dialect, exaggeration). The crowd laughs, interacts, jeers. The storyteller might recount an embellished version of the deliverance from the plague (linked to Redentore), adding miracles Volkmann would reject as superstition.\n\n6.3 The Language of the Street\n\nThe simulation must handle the linguistic transition.\nPalladio/Volkmann Layer: High German (Goethe's internal monologue), Latin (inscriptions), Tuscan Italian (polite society).\nGoldoni/Riva Layer: Venetian Dialect (Veneziano). The storyteller and the crowd do not speak standard Italian. They speak the language of Goldoni's plays—musical, truncated (e.g., Sior for Signore, Calle for Via, Ze for C'è). The AI must be capable of injecting these vernacular terms to authenticate NPC dialogue on the quay.32\n\n7. Synthesis Directives for Simulation\n\nThis section consolidates research into actionable rules for the LLM context file.\n\n7.1 Tone and Voice of Simulation\n\nThe Narrator (Goethe Type): Analytical, sensory, prone to aesthetic judgment. Values \"wholeness\" (Ganzheit) and \"nature.\" Critical of \"Catholic superstition\" (Capuchin dolls) but deeply moved by \"human greatness\" (Palladio).\nPhysical Environment: Must be described as a \"decaying theater set.\" Marble is often disguised brick. Music is divine but mechanically interrupted. Water is omnipresent and agitated (Sirocco).\n\n7.2 Interaction Rules (If/Then Logic)\n\n\nTrigger (User Action)\nSimulation Response (Content & Insight)\nSource Reference\nLook at Redentore façade\nDescribe interlocking pediments, 17 steps, flickering effect due to water. Insight: Note it is brick, not stone.\nPalladio 6, Goethe 1\nEnter Redentore (Oct 3)\nDescribe Capuchin activity, St. Francis altar. Insight: Violent contrast between noble architecture and \"poor\" decorations (straw/cardboard).\nGoethe 9, Arte Povera 17\nLook at San Giorgio Maggiore\nDescribe façade. Insight: Highlight visual unease of pedestals (columns seem on stilts), compare unfavorably to Redentore.\nPalladio 11, Goethe 9\nListen at Mendicanti\nDescribe Latin chant, grille. Insight: Shock of deep female voice singing King Saul; noise of paper roll beating time.\nBertoni 28, Goethe 22\nWalk on the Riva\nDescribe Slavic crowd, smells of frying. Insight: Storyteller uses dialect and improvisation (Goldoni/Commedia tradition).\nGoldoni 33, Volkmann 29\nAsk for historical fact\nConsult \"Volkmann database.\" Insight: If the fact is aesthetic, let the narrator (Goethe) correct or nuance Volkmann.\nVolkmann 3\n\n\n7.3 The Volkmann \"Check\"\n\nWhenever the user asks for \"facts\" or \"history,\" the simulation must by default provide information available in Volkmann's Nachrichten (1770/1777 edition).\nExample: If asked for the Campanile's height or the name of an altarpiece painter, give Volkmann's answer.\nConstraint: If Volkmann is inaccurate or boring, the \"Goethe\" persona can intervene to express boredom (\"Volkmann says this, but the eye sees that\").\n\n8. Deep Research Insights: Second-Order Implications\n\nBeyond surface data, several deep themes emerge from the juxtaposition of these sources on this specific date, enriching the simulation's texture.\n\n8.1 The \"Mask\" of Venice: Discrepancy between Surface and Substance\n\nA recurring theme unifies all observations of October 3: the disjunction between appearance and material reality.\nArchitecture: Il Redentore looks like marble but is made of brick and clay. It looks like a pagan Roman temple but is a Christian basilica.\nMusic: The voice sounds like a King (Saul) but is produced by a woman (figlia di coro).\nSociety: Commedia masks hide the actor, just as \"improvisation\" hides the absence of written text (Goldoni's critique).\nImplication for Simulation: The simulation must never present things as \"authentically\" what they seem. There must always be a layer of artifice or illusion for the observer to peel back. Venice is a city of performative surfaces.\n\n8.2 The \"Unfinished\" Project of Humanism\n\nPalladio's façade (where Goethe notes the use of brick because \"money and desire ran out\") and the \"cheap\" Capuchin decorations point to a Venice past its economic prime.\nUnderlying Trend: The tension between the Grand Design (Renaissance) and Economic Reality (18th Century Decline). The simulation takes place in a city that can no longer afford to build in solid marble, so it builds in stucco and decorates with straw. This melancholy of \"faded glory,\" hidden under the gaiety of Carnival or the Feast of St. Francis, is essential for atmospheric tone.\n\n8.3 The Acoustic Grille as Social Metaphor\n\nThe grille (grata) at the Mendicanti is a powerful metaphor that must run through the simulation. It separates the source of beauty (women, the sacred) from the consumer (the public, the traveler).\nConnection: This echoes the social separation between nobility and the street (Riva), and the separation between the antique ideal (Palladio) and modern reality. The simulation serves as the \"ear\" hearing through these barriers, capturing beauty imprisoned behind the bars of social convention.\n\n9. Synthetic Conclusion\n\nTo build the requested unique context file, one must generate a world virtually dominated by Palladian geometry, textually navigated via Volkmann's data, socially animated by Goldonian characters, and emotionally anchored in Goethe's critical and sensory experience of October 3, 1786.\nThe \"Redentore\" is not just a church; it is a debate on classical adaptation resolved in brick and stucco. The \"Capuchin Altar\" is not just a decoration; it is the friction between Franciscan poverty and Baroque art. The \"Mendicanti\" is not just a concert; it is a study in gender and concealment. By encoding these tensions, the simulation will transcend the simple historical map to become a living organism of the 18th century.\nSources des citations\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Italienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang, consulté le novembre 22, 2025, https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Italienische-Reise-vol-1-.pdf\nItalienische Reise-Teil 1 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -

September  1786. \n\nDAS  Amphitheater  ist  also  das  erste  bedeutende  Monu- \nment der  alten  Zeit,  das  ich  sehe,  tmd  so  gut  erhalten! \nAls  ich  hinein  trat,  mehr  noch  aber,  als  ich  oben  auf  dem \nRande  umher  ging,  schien  es  mir  seltsam,  etwas  Großes \nund  doch  eigentlich  nichts  zu  sehen.  Auch  will  es  leer \nnicht  gesehen  sein,  sondern  ganz  voll  von  Menschen,  wie \nman  es  neuerer  Zeit  Joseph  dem  Zweiten  und  Pius  dem \nSechsten  zu  Ehren  veranstaltet.  Der  Kaiser,  der  doch \nauch  Menschenmassen  vor  Augen  gewohnt  war,  soll  dar- \nüber erstaunt  sein.  Doch  nur  in  der  frühesten  Zeit  tat \nes  seine  ganze  Wirkung,  da  das  Volk  noch  mehr  Volk \nwar,  als  es  jetzt  ist.  Denn  eigentlich  ist  so  ein  Amphi- \ntheater recht  gemacht,  dem  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zu  impo- \nnieren, das  Volk  mit  sich  selbst  zum  besten  zu  haben. \nWenn  irgend  etwas  Schauwürdiges  auf  flacher  Erde  vor- \ngeht und  alles  zuläuft,  suchen  die  Hintersten  auf  alle \nmögliche  Weise  sich  über  die  Vordersten  zu  erheben:  man \ntritt  auf  Bänke,  rollt  Fässer  herbei,  fährt  mit  Wagen \nheran,  legt  Bretter  hinüber  und  herüber,  besetzt  einen \nbenachbarten  Hügel,  und  es  bildet  sich  in  der  Geschwin- \ndigkeit ein  Krater. \n\nKommt  das  Schauspiel  öfter  auf  derselben  Stelle  vor,  so \nbaut  man  leichte  Gerüste  für  die,  so  bezahlen  können, \nund  die  übrige  Masse  behilft  sich,  wie  sie  mag.  Dieses \nallgemeine  Bedürfnis  zu  befriedigen,  ist  hier  die  Aufgabe \ndes  Architekten.  Er  bereitet  einen  solchen  Krater  durch \nKunst,  so  einfach  als  nur  möglich,  damit  dessen  Zierat \ndas  Volk  selbst  werde.  Wenn  es  sich  so  beisammen  sah, \nmußte  es  über  sich  selbst  erstaunen;  denn  da  es  sonst \nnur  gewohnt,  sich  durcheinander  laufen  zu  sehen,  sich  in \neinem  Gewühle  ohne  Ordnung  und  sonderliche  Zucht  zu \nfinden,  so  sieht  das  vielköpfige,  vielsinnige,  schwankende, \nhin  und  her  irrende  Tier  sich  zu  einem  edlen  Körper \nvereinigt,  zu  einer  Einheit  bestimmt,  in  eine  Masse \nverbunden  und  befestigt,  als  eine  Gestalt,  von  eijiem \nGeiste  belebt.    Die  Simplizität  des  Oval  ist  jedem  Auge \n\n\n44  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  die  angenehmste  Weise  fühlbar,  und  jeder  Kopf  dient \nzum  Maße,  wie  ungeheuer  das  Ganze  sei.  Jetzt,  wenn \nman  es  leer  sieht,  hat  man  keinen  Maßstab,  man  weiß \nnicht,  ob  es  groß  oder  klein  ist. \n\nWegen  der  Unterhaltung  dieses  Werks  müssen  die  Vero- \nneser  gelobt  werden.  Es  ist  von  einem  rötlichen  Marmor \ngebaut,  den  die  Witterung  angreift;  daher  stellt  man  der \nReihe  nach  die  ausgefressenen  Stufen  immer  wieder  her, \nund  sie  scheinen  fast  alle  ganz  neu.  Eine  Inschrift  ge- \ndenkt eines  Hieronymus  Maurigenus  und  seines  auf  dieses \nMonument  verwendeten  unglaublichen  Fleißes.  Von  der \näußern  Mauer  steht  nur  ein  Stück,  und  ich  zweifele,  ob \nsie  je  ganz  fertig  geworden.  Die  untern  Gewölbe,  die  an \nden  großen  Platz,  II  Brä  genannt,  stoßen,  sind  an  Hand- \nwerker vermietet,  und  es  sieht  lustig  genug  aus,  diese \nHöhlungen  wieder  belebt  zu  sehen. \n\nDas  schönste,  aber  immer  geschlossene  Tor  heißt  Porta \nstuppa  oder  del  Pallio.  Als  Tor  und  in  der  großen  Ent- \nfernung, aus  der  man  es  schon  gewahr  wird,  ist  es  nicht \ngut  gedacht;  denn  erst  in  der  Nähe  erkennt  man  das \nVerdienst  des  Gebäudes. \n\nSie  geben  allerlei  Ursachen  an,  warum  es  geschlossen \nsei.  Ich  habe  jedoch  eine  Mutmaßung.  Die  Absicht  des \nKünstlers  ging  offenbar  dahin,  durch  dieses  Tor  eine  neue \nAnlage  des  Korso  zu  verursachen;  denn  auf  die  jetzige \nStraße  steht  es  ganz  falsch.  Die  linke  Seite  hat  lauter \nBaracken,  und  die  winkelrechte  Linie  der  Mitte  des  Tores \ngeht  auf  ein  Nonnenkloster  zu,  das  notwendig  hätte \nniedergelegt  werden  müssen.  Das  sah  man  wohl  ein,  auch \nmochten  die  Vornehmen  und  Reichen  nicht  Lust  haben, \nsich  in  dem  entfernten  Quartier  anzubauen.  Der  Künstler \nstarb  vielleicht,  und  so  schloß  man  das  Tor,  wodurch  die \nSache  nun  auf  einmal  geendigt  war. \n\nDas  Portal  des  Theatergebäudes,  von  sechs  großen  ioni- \nschen Säulen,  nimmt  sich  anständig  genug  aus.  Desto \nkleinlicher  erscheint  über  der  Türe,  vor  einer  gemalten \nNische,  die  von  zwei  korintliischen  Säulen  getragen  wird \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  45 \n\ndie  lebensgroße  Büste  des  Marchese  Maffei  in  einer \ngroßen  Perücke.  Der  Platz  ist  ehrenvoll,  aber  um  sich \ngegen  die  Größe  und  Tüchtigkeit  der  Säulen  einiger- \nmaßen zu  halten,  hätte  die  Büste  kolossal  sein  müssen. \nJetzt  steht  sie  kleinlich  auf  einem  Kragsteinchen,  unhar- \nmonisch mit  dem  Ganzen. \n\nAuch  die  Galerie,  die  den  Vorhof  einfaßt,  ist  kleinlich, \nund  die  kannelierten  dorischen  Zwerge  nehmen  sich  neben \nden  glatten  ionischen  Riesen  armselig  aus.  Doch  wollen \nwir  das  verzeihen  in  Betracht  der  schönen  Anstalt,  welche \nunter  diesen  Säulenlauben  angelegt  ist.  Hier  hat  man \ndie  Antiquitäten,  meist  in  und  um  Verona  gegraben,  ge- \nsammelt aufgestellt.  Einiges  soll  sogar  sich  im  Amphi- \ntheater gefunden  haben.  Es  sind  etrurische,  griechische, \nrömische,  bis  zu  den  niedern  Zeiten  und  auch  neuere. \nDie  Basreliefs  sind  in  die  Wände  eingemauert  und  mit \nden  Nummern  versehen,  die  ihnen  Maffei  gab,  als  er  sie \nin  seinem  Werke  Verona  illustrata  beschrieb.  Altäre, \nStücke  von  Säulen  und  dergleichen  Reste.  Ein  ganz  treff- \nlicher Dreifuß  von  weißem  Marmor,  worauf  Genien,  die \nsich  mit  den  Attributen  der  Götter  beschäftigen.  Raffael \nhat  dergleichen  in  den  Zwickeln  der  Farnesine  nachge- \nahmt und  verklärt. \n\nDer  Wind,  der  von  den  Gräbern  der  Alten  herweht, \nkommt  mit  Wohlgerüchen  wie  über  einen  Rosenhügel. \nDie  Grabmäler  sind  herzlich  und  rührend  und  stellen \nimmer  das  Leben  her.  Da  ist  ein  Mann,  der  neben  seiner \nFrau  aus  einer  Nische  wie  zu  einem  Fenster  heraussieht. \nDa  stehen  Vater  und  Mutter,  den  Sohn  in  der  Mitte,  ein- \nander mit  unaussprechlicher  Natürlichkeit  anblickend. \nHier  reicht  sich  ein  Paar  die  Hände.  Hier  scheint  ein \nVater,  auf  seinem  Sofa  ruhend,  von  der  Familie  unter- \nhalten zu  werden.  Mir  war  die  unmittelbare  Gegenwart \ndieser  Steine  höchst  rührend.  Von  späterer  Kunst  sind \nsie,  aber  einfach,  natürlich  und  allgemein  ansprechend. \nHier  ist  kein  geharnischter  Mann  auf  den  Knien,  der \neine  fröhliche  Auferstehung  erwartet.  Der  Künstler  hat \nmit  mehr  oder  weniger  Geschick  nur  die  einfache  Gegen- \nwart  der   Menschen  hingestellt,   ihre  Existenz  dadurch \n\n\n46  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfortgesetzt  und  bleibend  gemacht.  Sie  falten  nicht  die \nHände,  schauen  nicht  gen  Himmel,  sondern  sie  sind  hie- \nnieden,  was  sie  waren  und  was  sie  sind.  Sie  stehen  bei- \nsammen, nehmen  Anteil  aneinander,  lieben  sich;  und  das \nist  in  den  Steinen,  sogar  mit  einer  gewissen  Handwerks- \nunfähigkeit, allerliebst  ausgedrückt.  Ein  sehr  reich  ver- \nzierter marmorner  Pfeiler  gab  mir  auch  neue  Begriffe. \nSo  löblich  diese  Anstalt  ist,  so  sieht  man  ihr  doch  an, \ndaß  der  edle  Erhaltungsgeist,  der  sie  gegründet,  nicht \nmehr  in  ihr  fortlebt.  Der  kostbare  Dreifuß  geht  nächstens \nzugrunde,  weil  er  frei  steht,  gegen  Westen  der  Witterung \nausgesetzt.  Mit  einem  hölzernen  Futteral  wäre  dieser \nSchatz  leicht  zu  erhalten. \n\nDer  angefangene  Palast  des  Proveditore,  wäre  er  fertig \ngeworden,  hätte  ein  schön  Stück  Baukunst  gegeben.  Sonst \nbauen  die  Nobili  noch  viel,  leider  aber  ein  jeder  auf  den \nPlatz,  wo  seine  ältere  Wohnung  stand,  also  oft  in  engen \nGassen.  So  baut  man  jetzt  eine  prächtige  Fassade  eines \nSeminariums  in  einem  Gäßchen  der  entferntesten  Vor- \nstadt. \n\nAls  ich  mit  meinem  zufällig  aufgegriffenen  Begleiter  vor \neinem  großen  ernsthaften  Tore  eines  wunderbaren  Ge- \nbäudes vorüberging,  fragte  er  mich  gutmütig,  ob  ich  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  in  den  Hof  treten  wolle.  Es  war  der \nPalast  der  Justiz,  und  wegen  Höhe  der  Gebäude  erschien \nder  Hof  doch  nur  als  ein  ungeheurer  Brunnen.  Hier \nwerden,  sagte  er,  alle  die  Verbrecher  und  Verdächtigen \nverwahrt.  Ich  sah  umher,  und  durch  alle  Stockwerke \ngingen,  an  zahlreichen  Türen  hin,  offene  mit  eisernen \nGeländern  versehene  Gänge.  Der  Gefangene,  wie  er  aus \nseinem  Kerker  heraustrat,  um  zum  Verhör  geführt  zu \nwerden,  stand  in  der  freien  Tuft,  war  aber  auch  den \nBlicken  aller  ausgesetzt;  und  weil  nun  mehrere  Verhör- \nstuben sein  mochten,  so  klapperten  die  Ketten  bald  über \ndiesem,  bald  über  jenem  Gange  durch  alle  Stockwerke. \nEs  war  ein  verwünschter  Anblick,  und  ich  leugne  nicht, \ndaß  der  gute  Humor,  womit  ich  meine  Vögel  abgefertigt \nhatte,  hier  doch  einen  etwas  schweren  Stand  würde  ge- \nfunden haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  47 \n\nIch  ging  auf  der  Kante  des  amphitheatralischen  Kraters \nbei  Sonnenuntergang,  der  schönsten  Aussicht  genießend \nüber  Stadt  und  Gegend.  Ich  war  ganz  allein,  und  unten \nauf  den  breiten  Steinen  des  Brä  gingen  Mengen  von \nMenschen,  Männer  von  allen  Ständen,  Weiber  vomMittel- \nstande  spazieren.  Diese  letztern  nehmen  sich  in  ihren \nschwarzen  Überkleidern,  aus  dieser  Vogelperspektive,  gar \nmumienhaft  aus. \n\nDer  Zendale  und  die  Veste,  die  dieser  Klasse  statt  aller \nGarderobe  dient,  ist  übrigens  eine  Tracht,  ganz  einge- \nrichtet für  ein  Volk,  das  nicht  immer  für  Reinlichkeit \nsorgen  und  doch  immer  ööentlich  erscheinen,  bald  in  der \nKirche,  bald  auf  dem  Spaziergange  sein  will.  Veste  ist \nein  schwarztaffeter  Rock,  der  über  andere  Röcke  gewor- \nfen wird.  Hat  das  Frauenzimmer  einen  reinlichen  weißen \ndarunter,  so  versteht  sie  den  schwarzen  an  der  einen  Seite \nin  die  Höhe  zu  heben.  Dieser  wird  so  angegürtet,  daß \ner  die  Taille  abschneidet  und  die  Lippen  des  Korsetts \nbedeckt,  welches  von  jeglicher  Farbe  sein  kann.  Der \nZendale  ist  eine  große  Kappe,  mit  langen  Barten,  die \nKappe  selbst  durch  ein  Drahtgestell  hoch  über  den  Kopf \ngehalten,  die  Barte  aber  wie  eine  Schärpe  um  den  Leib \ngeknüpft,  so  daß  die  Enden  hinterwärts  herunterfallen. \n\nAls  ich  heute  wieder  von  der  Arena  wegging,  kam  ich \neinige  tausend  Schritte  davon  zu  einem  modernen  ößent- \nlichen  Schauspiel.  Vier  edle  Veroneser  schlugen  Ball \ngegen  vier  Vicentiner.  Sie  treiben  dies  sonst  unter  sich \ndas  ganze  Jahr,  etwa  zwei  Stunden  vor  Nacht;  diesmal, \nwegen  der  fremden  Gegner,  lief  das  Volk  unglaublich  zu. \nEs  können  immer  vier-  bis  fünftausend  Zuschauer  ge- \nwesen sein.  Frauen  sah  ich  von  keinem  Stande. \nVorhin,  als  ich  vom  Bedürfnis  der  Menge  in  einem  sol- \nchen Falle  sprach,  hab'  ich  das  natürliche  zufällige  Am- \nphitaeater  schon  beschrieben,  wie  ich  das  Volk  hier  über- \neinander gebaut  sah.  Ein  lebhaftes  Händeklatschen  hört' \nich  schon  von  weiten,  jeder  bedeutende  Schlag  war  da- \nvon begleitet.  Das  Spiel  aber  geht  so  vor  sich:  In  ge- \nhöriger Entfernung  voneinander   sind   zwei   gelind  ab- \n\n\n4  3  ITA  1  JENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nliängige  Bretterflächen  errichtet.  Derjenige,  der  den  Ball \nausschlägt,  steht,  die  Rechte  mit  einem  hölzernen  breiten \nStachelringe  bewaffnet,  auf  der  obersten  Höhe.  Ir^dem \nnun  ein  anderer  von  seiner  Partei  ihm  den  r>all  zuwirft, \nso  läuft  er  herunter  dem  Ball  entgegen  und  vermehrt  da- \ndurch die  Gewalt  des  Schlages,  womit  er  denselben  zu \ntreffen  weiß.  Die  Gegner  suchen  ihn  zurückzuschlagen, \nund  so  geht  es  hin  und  wieder,  bis  er  zuletzt  im  Felde \nliegen  bleibt.  Die  schönsten  Stellungen,  wert,  in  Marmor \nnachgebildet  zu  werden,  kommen  dabei  zum  Vorschein. \nDa  es  lauter  wohlgewachsene,  rüstige,  junge  Leute  sind, \nin  kurzer,  knapper,  weißer  Kleidung,  so  unterscheiden \nsich  die  Parteien  nur  durch  ein  farbiges  Abzeichen.  Be- \nsonders schön  ist  die  Stellung,  in  welche  der  Ausschlagende \ngerät,  indem  er  von  der  schiefen  Fläche  herunter  läuft \nund  den  Ball  zu  treffen  ausholt;  sie  nähert  sich  der  des \nBorghesischen  Fechters. \n\nSonderbar  kam  es  mir  vor,  daß  sie  diese  Übung  an  einer \nnlten  Stadtmauer,  ohne  die  mindeste  Bequemlichkeit  für \ndie  Zuschauer,  vornehmen;  warum  sie  es  nicht  im  Amphi- \ntheater tun,  wo  so  schöner  Raum  wäre! \n\nDen  //.  September. \nWas  ich  von  Gemälden  gesehen,  will  ich  nur  kurz  be- \nrühren und  einige  Betrachtungen  hinzufügen.  Ich  mache \ndiese  wunderbare  Reise  nicht,  um  micli  selbst  zu  be- \ntrügen, sondern  um  mich  an  den  Gegenständen  kennen \nzu  lernen;  da  sage  ich  mir  denn  ganz  aufrichtig,  daß  ich \nvon  der  Kunst,  von  dem  Handwerk  des  Malers  wenig \nverstehe.  Meine  Aufmerksamkeit,  meine  Betrachtung \nkann  nur  auf  den  jiraktischen  Teil,  auf  den  Gegenstand \nund  auf  die  Behandlung  desselben  im  allgemeinen  ge- \nrichtet sein. \n\nSan  Giorgio  ist  eine  Galerie  von  guten  Gemälden,  alle \nAltarblätter,  wo  nicht  von  gleichem  Wert,  doch  duich- \naus  merkwürdig.  Aber  die  unglückseigen  Künstler,  was \nmußten  die  malen!  und  für  wen!  Ein  Mannaregen,  viel- \nleicht dreißig  Fuß  lang  und  zwanzig  hoch!  das  Wunder \nder  fünf  Brote  zum  Gegenstück!  was  war  daran  zu  malen: \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  49 \n\nHungrige  Menschen,  die  über  kleine  Körner  herfallen, \nunzählige  andere,  denen  Brot  präsentiert  wird.  Die \nKünstler  haben  sich  die  Folter  gegeben,  um  solche  Arm- \nseligkeiten bedeutend  zu  machen.  Und  doch  hat,  durch \ndiese  Nötigung  gereizt,  das  Genie  schöne  Sachen  hervor- \ngebracht. Ein  Künstler,  der  die  heilige  Ursula  mit  den \neilftausend  Jungfrauen  vorzustellen  hatte,  zog  sich  mit \ngroßem  Verstand  aus  der  Sache.  Die  Heilige  steht  im \nVordergrunde,  als  habe  sie  siegend  das  Land  in  Besitz \ngenommen;  sie  ist  sehr  edel,  amazonenhaft-jungfräulich, \nohne  Reiz  gebildet;  in  der  alles  verkleinernden  Ferne \nhingegen  sieht  man  ihre  Schar  aus  den  Schiften  steigen \nund  ia  Prozession  herankommen.  Die  Himmelfahrt  Maria \nim  Dom,  von  Tizian,  ist  sehr  verschwärzt,  der  Gedanke \nlobenswert,  daß  die  angehende  Göttin  nicht  himmel- \nwärts, sondern  herab  nach  ihren  Freunden  blickt. \nIn  der  Galerie  Gherardini  fand  ich  sehr  schöne  Sachen \nvon  Orbetto  und  lernte  diesen  verdienten  Künstler  auf \neinmal  kennen.  In  der  Entfernung  erfährt  man  nur  von \nden  ersten  Künstlern,  und  oft  begnügt  man  sich  mit  ihren \nNamen;  wenn  man  aber  diesem  Sternenhimmel  näher \ntritt  und  die  von  der  zweiten  und  dritten  Größe  nun  auch \nzu  flimmern  anfangen  und  jeder  auch  als  zum  ganzen \nSternbild  gehörend  hervortritt,  dann  wird  die  Welt  weit \nund  die  Kunst  reich.  Den  Gedanken  eines  Bildes  muß \nich  hier  loben.  Nur  zwei  Halbfiguren.  Simson  ist  eben \nim  Schöße  der  Delila  eingeschlafen,  sie  greift  leise  über \nihn  hinweg  nach  einer  Schere,  die  auf  dem  Tisch  neben \nder  Lampe  liegt.  Die  Ausfülirung  ist  sehr  brav.  Im \nPalast  Canossa  war  mir  eine  Danae  bemerklich. \nDer  Palast  Bevilacqua  enthält  die  köstlichsten  Sachen. \nEin  sogenanntes  Paradies  von  Tintorett,  eigentlich  aber \ndie  Krönung  der  Maria  zur  Himmelskönigin  in  Gegen- \nwart aller  Erzväter,  Propheten,  Apostel,  Heiligen,  Engel \nusw.,  eine  Gelegenheit,  den  ganzen  Reichtum  des  glück- \nlichsten Genies  zu  entwickeln.  Leichtigkeit  des  Pinsels, \nGeist,  Mannigfaltigkeit  des  Ausdrucks,  dies  alles  zu  be- \nwundern und  sich  dessen  zu  erfreuen,  müßte  man  das \nStück  selbst  besitzen  und  es  zeitlebens  vor  Augen  haben. \n\nGOETHE  IV  4 \n\n\n50  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  Arbeit  geht  ins  Unendliche,  ja  die  letzten  in  der \nGlorie  verschwindenden  Engelsköpfe  haben  noch  Cha- \nrakter. Die  größten  Figuren  mögen  einen  Fuß  hoch  sein, \nMaria  und  Christus,  der  ihr  die  Krone  aufsetzt,  etwa \nvier  Zoll.  Die  Eva  ist  doch  das  schönste  Weibchen  auf \ndem  Bilde  und  noch  immer  von  alters  her  ein  wenig \nlüstern. \n\nEin  paar  Porträte  von  Paul  Veronese  haben  meine  Hoch- \nachtung für  diesen  Künstler  nur  vermehrt.  Die  Antiken- \nsammlung ist  herrlich,  ein  hingestreckter  Sohn  der  Niobe \nköstlich,  die  Büsten,  ungeachtet  ihrer  restaurierten  Nasen, \nmeistens  höchst  interessant,  ein  August  mit  der  Bürger- \nkrone, ein  Caligula  und  andere. \n\nJ'ls  liegt  in  meiner  Natur,  das  Große  und  Schöne  willig \nund  mit  Freuden  zu  verehren,  und  diese  Anlage  an  so \nlaerrlichen  Gegenständen  Tag  für  Tag,  Stunde  für  Stunde \nauszubilden,  ist  das  seligste  aller  Gefühle. \nIn  einem  Lande,  wo  man  des  Tages  genießt,  besonders \naber  des  Abends  sich  erfreut,  ist  es  höchst  bedeutend, \nwenn  die  Nacht  einbricht.  Dann  hört  die  Arbeit  auf, \ndann  kehrt  der  Spaziergänger  zurück,  der  Vater  will  seine \nTochter  wieder  zu  Hause  sehen,  der  Tag  hat  ein  Ende; \ndoch  was  Tag  sei,  wissen  wir  Cimmerier  kaum.  In  ewi- \ngem Nebel  und  Trübe  ist  es  uns  einerlei,  ob  es  Tag  oder \nNacht  ist;  denn  wie  viel  Zeit  können  wir  uns  unter  freiem \nHimmel  wahrhaft  ergehen  und  ergötzen:  Wie  hier  die \nNacht  eintritt,  ist  der  Tag  entschieden  vorbei,  der  aus \nAbend  und  Morgen  bestand;  vierundzwanzig  Stunden  sind \nverlebt,  eine  neue  Rechnung  geht  an,  die  Glocken  läuten, \nder  Rosenkranz  wird  gebetet,  mit  brennender  Lampe  tritt \ndie  Magd  in  das  Zimmer  und  spricht:  Felicissima  nottc! \nDiese  Epoche  verändert  sich  mit  jeder  Jahreszeit,  und  der \nMensch,  der  hier  lebendig  lebt,  kann  nicht  irre  werden, \nweil  jeder  Genuß  seines  Daseins  sich  nicht  auf  die  Stunde, \nsondern  auf  die  Tageszeit  bezieht.  Zwänge  man  dem \nVolke  einen  deutschen  Zeiger  auf,  so  würde  man  es  ver- \nwirrt machen,  denn  der  seinige  ist  innigst  mit  seiner \nNatur  verwebt.  Anderthalb  Stunden,  eine  Stunde  vor \nNacht  fängt  der  Adel  an,  au.szufahren;   es  geht  auf  den \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  51 \n\nBrä,  die  lange  breite  Straße  nach  der  Porta  nuova  zu,  das \nTor  hinaus,  an  der  Stadt  hin,  und  wie  es  Nacht  schlägt, \nkehrt  alles  um.  Teils  fahren  sie  an  die  Kirchen,  das \nAve  Maria  della  sera  zu  beten,  teils  halten  sie  auf  dem \nBrä;  die  Kavaliers  treten  an  die  Kutschen,  unterhalten \nsich  mit  den  Damen,  und  das  dauert  eine  Weile,  ich  habe \ndas  Ende  niemals  abgewartet;  die  Fußgänger  bleiben \nweit  in  die  Nacht.  Heute  war  gerade  so  viel  Regen  nie- \ndergegangen, um  den  Staub  zu  löschen;  es  war  wirklich \nein  lebendiger,  munterer  Anblick. \n\nUm  mich  ferner  in  einem  wichtigen  Punkte  der  Landes- \ngewohnheit gleichzustellen,  habe  ich  mir  ein  Hilfsmittel \nerdacht,  wie  ich  ihre  Stundenrechnung  mir  leichter  zu \neigen  machte.  Nachfolgendes  Bild  kann  davon  einen  Be- \ngriff geben.  Der  innere  Kreis  bedeutet  unsere  vierund- \nzwanzig Stunden,  von  Mitternacht  zu  Mitternacht,  in \nzweimal  zwölf  geteilt,  wie  wir  zählen  und  unsere  Uhren \nsie  zeigen.  Der  mittlere  Kreis  deutet  an,  wie  die  Glocken \nin  der  jetzigen  Jahreszeit  hier  schlagen,  nämlich  gleich- \nfalls zweimal  bis  zwölf  in  vierundzwanzig  Stunden,  allein \ndergestalt,  daß  es  eins  schlägt,  wenn  es  bei  uns  acht \nschlüge,  und  so  fort,  bis  zwölfe  voll  sind.  Morgens  acht \nUhr  nach  unserm  Zeiger  schlägt  es  wieder  eins  usw.  Der \noberste  Kreis  zeigt  nun  endlich,  wie  bis  vierundzwanzig \nim  Leben  gezählt  wird.  Ich  höre  z.  B.  in  der  Nacht  sie- \nben schlagen  und  weiß,  daß  Mitternacht  um  fünf  ist,  so \nziehe  ich  diese  Zahl  von  jener  ab  und  habe  also  zwei \nUhr  Nachmitternacht.  Hör  ich  am  Tage  sieben  schlagen \nund  weiß,  daß  auch  Mittag  um  fünf  Uhr  ist,  so  verfahre \nich  ebenso  und  habe  zwei  Uhr  Nachmittag.  Will  ich \naber  die  Stunden  nach  hiesiger  Weise  aussprechen,  so \nmuß  ich  wissen,  daß  Mittag  siebenzehn  Uhr  ist;  hiezu \nfüge  ich  noch  die  zwei  und  sage  neunzehn  Uhr.  Wenn \nman  dies  zum  erstenmal  hört  und  überdenkt,  so  scheint \nes  höchst  verworren  und  schwer  durchzuführen;  man  wird \nes  aber  gar  bald  gewohnt  und  findet  diese  Beschäftigung \nunterhaltend,  wie  sich  auch  das  Volk  an  dem  ewigen \nHin-  und  Widerrechnen  ergötzt,  wie  Kinder  an  leicht  zu \nüberwindenden    Schwierig-keiten.     Sie    haben    ohnedies \n\n\n52  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nimmer  die  Finger  in  der  Luft,  rechnen  alles  im  Kopfe \nund  machen  sich  gern  mit  Zahlen  zu  schaffen.  Ferner  ist \ndem  Inländer  die  Sache  so  viel  leichter,  weil  er  sich  um \nMittag  und  Mitternacht  eigentlich  nicht  bekümmert  und \nnicht,  wie  der  Fremde  in  diesem  Lande  tut,  zwei  Zeiger \nmiteinander  vergleicht.  Sie  zählen  nur  von  Abend  die \nStunden,  wie  sie  schlagen;  am  Tag  addieren  sie  die  Zahl \nzu  der  ihnen  bekannten  abwechselnden  Mittagszahl.  Das \nweitere  erläutern  die  der  Figur  beigefügten  Anmerkun- \ngen. (Siehe  das  nebenstehende  Blatt.) \nDas  Volk  rührt  sich  hier  sehr  lebhaft  durcheinander;  be- \nsonders in  einigen  Straßen,  wo  Kaufläden  und  Hand- \nwerksbuden aneinander  stoßen,  sieht  es  recht  lustig  aus. \nDa  ist  nicht  etwa  eine  Tür  vor  dem  Laden  oder  Arbeits- \nzimmer, nein,  die  ganze  Breite  des  Hauses  ist  often, \nman  sieht  bis  in  die  Tiefe  und  alles,  was  darin  vorgeht. \nDie  Schneider  nähen,  die  Schuster  ziehen  und  pochen \nalle  halb  auf  der  Gasse;  ja  die  Werkstätten  machen  einen \nTeil  der  Straße.  Abends,  wenn  Lichter  brennen,  sieht  es \nrecht  lebendig. \n\nAuf  den  Plätzen  ist  es  an  Markttagen  sehr  voll.  Gemüse \nund  Früchte  unübersehlich,  Knoblauch  und  Zwiebeln \nnach  Herzenslust.  Übrigens  schreien,  schäkern  und  singen \nsie  den  ganzen  Tag,  werfen  und  balgen  sich,  jauchzen \nund  lachen  unaufhörlich.  Die  milde  Luft,  die  wohlfeile \nNahrung  läßt  sie  leicht  leben.  Alles,  was  nur  kann,  ist \nunter  freiem  Himmel. \n\nNachts  geht  nun  das  Singen  und  Lärmen  recht  an.  Das \nLiedchen  von  Marlborough  hört  man  auf  allen  Straßen, \ndann  ein  Hackebrett,  eine  Violine.  Sie  üben  sich,  alle \nVögel  mit  Pfeifen  nachzumachen.  Die  wunderlichsten \nTöne  brechen  überall  hervor.  Ein  solches  Übergefühl  des \nDaseins  verleiht  ein  mildes  Klima  auch  der  Armut,  und \nder  Schatten  des  Volks  scheint  selbst  noch  ehrwürdig. \nDie  uns  so  sehr  auffallende  Unreinlichkeit  und  wenige \nBe(iuemlichkeit  der  Häuser  entspringt  auch  daher:  sie \nsind  immer  draußen,  und  in  ihrer  Sorglosigkeit  denken \nsie  an  nichts.  Dem  Volk  ist  alles  recht  und  gut;  der \nMittelmann  lebt  auch  von  einem  Tag  zum  andern;   der \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  53 \n\nVergleichlingskreis \n\nder  italienischen  und  deutschen  Uhr,  auch  der  italienischen \nZeiger  für  die  zweite  Hälfte  des  Septembers. \n\nM  i  1 1  a  ?. \n\n\nMitternacht. \n\nDi2  Nacht  wächst  mit  jedem  halben  Monat  eine  halbe  Stunde. \n\nMonat.

Ihre \nGesellschaften  halten  sie  in  öfifentlichen  Versammlungs- \nhiiusern.  Vorhöfe  und  Säulengänge  sind  alle  mit  Unrat \nbesudelt,  und  es  geht  ganz  natürlich  zu.  Das  Volk  fühlt \nsich  immer  vor.  Der  Reiche  kann  reich  sein,  Paläste \nbauen,  der  Nobile  darf  regieren,  aber  wenn  er  einen \nSäulengang,  einen  Vorhof  anlegt,  so  bedient  sich  das \nVolk  dessen  zu  seinem  Bedürfnis,  und  es  hat  kein  drin- \ngenderes, als  das  so  schnell  wie  möglich  loszuwerden, \nwas  es  so  häufig  als  möglich  zu  sich  genommen  hat.  Will \neiner  das  nicht  leiden,  so  muß  er  nicht  den  großen  Herrn \nspielen,  d.  h.  er  muß  nicht  tun,  als  wenn  ein  Teil  seiner \nWohnung  dem  Publikum  angehöre;  er  macht  seine  Türe \nzu,  und  so  ist  es  auch  gut.  An  öffentlichen  Gebäuden \nläßt  sich  das  Volk  sein  Recht  nun  gar  nicht  nehmen, \nund  das  ist's,  worüber  der  Fremde  durch  ganz  Italien \nBeschwerde  führt. \n\nIch  betrachtete  heut,  auf  mancherlei  Wegen  durch  die \nStadt,  die  Tracht  und  die  Manieren  besonders  des  Mittel- \nstandes, der  sich  sehr  häufig  und  geschäftig  zeigt.  Sie \nschlenkern  im  Gehen  alle  mit  den  Armen.  Personen  von \neinem  höhern  Stande,  die  bei  gewissen  Gelegenheiten \neinen  Degen  tragen,  schlenkern  nur  mit  ci/icm,  weil  sie \ngewohnt  sind,  den  linken  still  zu  halten. \nObgleich  das  Volk  seinen  Geschäften  und  Bedürfnissen \nsehr  sorglos  nachgeht,  so  hat  es  doch  auf  alles  Fremde \nein  scharfes  Auge.  So  könnt'  ich  die  ersten  Tage  be- \nmerken, daß  jedermann  meine  Stiefeln  betrachtete,  da \nman  sich  derselben  als  einer  feuern  Tracht  nicht  einmal \nim  Winter  bedient.  Jetzt,  da  ich  Schuh  und  Strümpfe \ntrage,  sieht  mich  niemand  mehr  an.  Aber  merkwürdig \nwar  mir's,  daß  heute  früh,  da  sie  alle  mit  Blumen,  Ge- \nmüse, Knoblauch  und  so  vielen  andern  Markterzeugnissen \ndurcheinander  liefen,  ihnen  der  Zypressenzweig  nicht  ent- \nging, den  ich  in  der  Hand  trug.  Einige  grüne  Zapfen \nhingen  daran,  und  daneben  hielt  ich  blühende  Kapem- \nzweige.  Sie  sahen  alle,  groß  und  klein,  mir  auf  die  Finger \nund  schienen  wunderliche  Gedanken  zu  haben. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  55 \n\nDiese  Zweige  bracht'  ich  aus  dem  Garten  Giusti,  der  eine \ntrefifliche  Lage  und  ungeheure  Zypressen  hat,  die  alle \npfriemenartig  in  die  Luft  stehen.  Wahrscheinlich  sind  die \nspitz  zugeschnittenen  Taxus  der  nordischen  Gartenkunst \nNachahmungen  dieses  herrlichen  Naturprodukts.  Ein \nBaum,  dessen  Zweige  von  unten  bis  oben,  die  ältesten \nwie  die  jüngsten,  gen  Himmel  streben,  der  seine  drei- \nhundert Jahre  dauert,  ist  wohl  der  Verehrung  wert.  Der \nZeit  nach,  da  der  Garten  angelegt  worden,  haben  diese \nschon  ein  so  hohes  Alter  erreicht. \n\nViccfiza,  den  ig.  Seftember. \nDer  Weg  von  Verona  hieher  ist  sehr  angenehm:  man  fährt \nnordostwärts  an  den  Gebirgen  hin  und  hat  die  Vorder- \nberge, die  aus  Sand,  Kalk,  Ton,  Mergel  bestehen,  immer \nlinker  Hand;  auf  den  Hügeln,  die  sie  bilden,  liegen  Orte, \nSchlösser,  Häuser.  Rechts  verbreitet  sich  die  weite  Fläche , \ndurch  die  man  fährt.  Der  gerade,  gut  unterhaltene,  breite \nWeg  geht  durch  fruchtbares  Feld;  man  blickt  in  tiefe  Baum- \nreihen, an  welchen  die  Reben  in  die  Höhe  gezogen  sind, \ndie  sodann,  als  wären  es  luftige  Zweige,  herunterfallen. \nHier  kann  man  sich  eine  Idee  von  Festonen  bilden!  Die \nTrauben  sind  zeitig  und  beschweren  die  Ranken,  die  lang \nund  schwankend  niederhängen.  Der  Weg  ist  voll  Menschen \naller  Art  und  Gewerbes;  besonders  freuten  mich  die  Wagen \nmit  niedrigen,  tellerartigen  Rädern,  die,  mit  vier  Ochsen \nbespannt,  große  Kufen  hin  und  wieder  führen,  in  welchen \ndie  Weintrauben  aus  den  Gärten  geholt  und  gestampft \nwerden.  Die  Führer  standen,  wenn  sie  leer  waren,  drinnen; \nes  sah  einem  Bacchischen  Triumphzug  ganz  ähnlich. \nZwischen  den  Weinreihen  ist  der  Boden  zu  allerlei  Arten \nGetreide,  besonders  zu  Türkischkorn  und  Sörgel  benutzt. \nKommt  man  gegen  Vicenza,  so  steigen  wieder  Hügel  von \nNorden  nach  Süden  auf — sie  sind  vulkanisch,  sagt  man \n— und  schließen  die  Ebene.  Vicenza  liegt  an  ihrem  Fuße \nund,  wenn  man  will,  in  einem  Busen,  den  sie  bilden. \n\nVor  einigen  Stunden  bin  ich  hier  angekommen,  habe  schon \ndie  Stadt  durchlaufen,  das  Olympische  Theater  und  die \n\n\n5  6  ITALTENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nGebäude  des  Palladio  gesehen.  Man  hat  ein  sehr  artiges \n]5üchelchen  mit  Kupfern  zur  Bequemlichkeit  der  Fremden \nherausgegeben,  mit  einem  kunstverständigen 'I'exte.  Wenn \nman  nun  diese  Werke  gegenwärtig  sieht,  so  erkennt  man \nerst  den  großen  Wert  derselben:  denn  sie  sollen  ja  durch \nilire  wirkliche  Größe  und  Körperlichkeit  das  Auge  füllen \nund  durch  die  schöne  Harmonie  ihrer  Dimensionen  nicht \nnur  in  abstrakten  Aufrissen,  sondern  mit  dem  ganzen  per- \nspektivischen Vordringen  und  Zurückweichen  den  Geist \nbefriedigen;  und  so  sag'  ich  vom  Palladio:  er  ist  ein  recht \ninnerlich  und  von  innen  heraus  großer  Mensch  gewesen. \nDie  höchste  Schwierigkeit,  mit  der  dieser  Mann,  wie  alle \nneuern  Architekten,  zu  kämpfen  hatte,  ist  die  schickliche \nAnwendung  der  Säulenordnungen  in  der  bürgerlichen  Bau- \nkunst: denn  Säulen  und  Mauern  zu  verbinden,  bleibt  doch \nimmer  ein  Widerspruch.  Aber  wie  er  das  untereinander \ngearbeitet  hat,  wie  er  durch  die  Gegenwart  seiner  Werke \nimponiert  und  vergessen  macht,  daß  er  nur  überredet!  Es \nist  wirklich  etwas  Göttliches  in  seinen  Anlagen,  völlig  wie \ndie  Force  des  großen  Dichters,  der  aus  Walu-heit  und \nLüge  ein  Drittes  bildet,  dessen  erborgtes  Dasein  uns  be- \nzaubert. \n\nDas  Olympische  Theater  ist  ein  Theater  der  Alten,  im \nkleinen  realisiert,  und  unaussprechlich  schön,  aber  gegen \ndie  unsrigen  kömmt  mir's  vor  wie  ein  vornehmes,  reiches, \nwohlgebildetes  Kind  gegen  einen  klugen  Wcltmenschen, \nder,  weder  so  vornehm  noch  so  reich,  noch  wohlgebildet, \nbesser  weiß,  was  er  mit  seinen  Mitteln  bewirken  kann. \nBeti-achtet  man  nun  hier  am  Orte  die  herrlichen  Gebäude, \ndie  jener  Mann  auffiihrte,  und  sieht,  wie  sie  schon  durch \ndas  enge  schmutzige  Bedürfnis  der  Menschen  entstellt \nsind,  wie  die  Anlagen  meist  über  die  Kräfte  der  Unter- \nnehmer Avaren,  wie  wenig  diese  köstlichen  Denkmale  eines \nhohen  Menschengeistes  zu  dem  Leben  der  übrigen  passen, \nso  fällt  einem  denn  doch  ein,  daß  es  in  allem  andern  eben- \nso ist:  denn  man  verdient  wenig  Dank  von  den  Menschen, \nwenn  man  ihr  inneres  Bedürfnis  erhöhen,  ihnen  eine  große \nIdee  von  ihnen  selbst  geben,  ihnen  das  Herrliche  eines \nwahren  edlen  Daseins  zum  Gefühl  bringen  will.     Aber \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  57 \n\nwenn  man  die  Vögel  belügt,  Märchen  erzählt,  von  Tag  zu \nTag  ihnen  forthelfend  sie  verschlechtert,  da  ist  man  ihr \nMann,  imd  darum  gefällt  sich  die  neuere  Zeit  in  so  viel \nAbgeschmacktem.  Ich  sage  das  nicht,  um  meine  Freunde \nherunterzusetzen,  ich  sage  nur,  daß  sie  so  sind  und  daß \nman  sich  nicht  verwundern  muß,  wenn  alles  ist,  wie \nes  ist. \n\nWie  sich  die  Basilika  des  Palladio  neben  einem  alten,  mit \nungleichen  Fenstern  übersäten,  kastellähnhchen  Gebäude \nausnimmt,  welches  der  Baumeister  zusamt  dem  Turm \ngewiß  weggedacht  hat,  ist  nicht  auszudrücken,  und  ich \nmuß  mich  schon  auf  eine  wunderliche  Weise  zusammen- \nfassen: denn  ich  finde  auch  hier — leider  gleich!  —  das, \nwas  ich  fliehe  und  suche,  nebeneinander. \n\nDen  20.  September. \nGestern  war  Oper,  sie  dauerte  bis  nach  Mitternacht,  und \nich  sehnte  mich  zu  ruhen.  \"Die  drei  Sultaninnen\"  und  \"Die \nEntführung  aus  dem  Serail\"  haben  manche  Fetzen  her- \ngegeben, woraus  das  Stück  mit  weniger  Klugheit  zu- \nsammengeflickt ist.  Die  Musik  hört  sich  bequem  an,  ist \naber  wahrscheinlich  von  einem  Liebhaber;  kein  neuer \nGedanke,  der  mich  getroffen  hätte.  Die  Ballette  dagegen \nsind  allerliebst.  Das  Hauptpaar  tanzte  eine  Allemande, \ndaß  man  nichts  Zierlicheres  sehen  konnte. \nDas  Theater  ist  neu,  lieblich,  schön,  modest-prächtig, \nalles  uniform,  wie  es  einer  Provinzialstadt  geziemt;  jede \nLoge  hat  ihren  übergeschlagenen,  gleichfarbigen  Teppich, \ndie  des  Capitan  Grande  ist  nur  durch  einen  etwas  längern \nÜberhang  ausgezeichnet. \n\nDie  erste  Sängerin,  vom  ganzen  Volke  sehr  begünstigt, \nwird,  wie  sie  auftritt,  entsetzlich  beklatscht,  und  die  Vögel \nstellen  sich  vor  Freuden  ganz  ungebärdig,  wenn  sie  etwas \nrecht  gut  macht,  welches  sehr  oft  geschieht.  Es  ist  ein \nnatürlich  Wesen,  hübsche  Figur,  schöne  Stimme,  ein  ge- \nfällig Gesicht  und  von  einem  recht  honetten  Anstand;  in \nden  Armen  könnte  sie  etwas  mehr  Grazie  haben.  In- \ndessen komme  ich  denn  doch  nicht  wieder;  ich  fühle,  daß \nich  zum  Vogel  verdorben  bin. \n\n\n58  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  21 .  September. \nHeute  besuchte  ich  Dr.  Turra;  wohl  fünf  Jahre  hat  er  sich \nmit  Leidenschaft  auf  die  Pflanzenkunde  gelegt,  ein  Herba- \nrium der  italienischen  Flora  gesammelt,  unter  dem  vorigen \nBischof  einen  botanischen  Garten  eingerichtet.  Das  ist \naber  alles  hin.  Medizinische  Praxis  vertrieb  die  Natur- \ngeschichte, das  Herbarium  wird  von  Würmern  gespeist, \nder  Bischof  ist  tot,  und  der  botanische  Garten  wieder, \nwie  billig,  mit  Kohl  und  Knoblauch  bepflanzt. \nDr.  Turra  ist  ein  gar  feiner  guter  Mann.  Er  erzählte  mir \nmit  Offenheit,  Seelenreinheit  und  Bescheidenheit  seine \nGeschichte  und  sprach  überhaupt  sehr  bestimmt  und  ge- \nfällig, hatte  aber  nicht  Lust,  seine  Schränke  aufzutun,  die \nvielleicht  in  keinem  präsentablen  Zustande  sein  mochten. \nDer  Diskurs  kam  bald  ins  Stocken. \n\nAbends. \nIch  ging  zum  alten  I'aumeister  Scamozzi,  der  des  Palladio \nGebäude  herausgegeben  hat  und  ein  wackerer,  leiden- \nschaftlicher Künstler  ist.  Er  gab  mir  einige  Anleitung, \nvergnügt  über  meine  Teilnahme.  Unter  den  Gebäuden \ndes  Palladio  ist  eins,  für  das  ich  immer  eine  besondere \nVorliebe  hatte,  es  soll  seine  eigne  Wohnung  gewesen  sein; \naber  in  der  Nähe  ist  es  weit  mehr,  als  man  im  Bilde  sieht. \nIch  möchte  es  gezeichnet  und  mit  den  Farben  illuminiert \nhaben,  die  ihm  das  Material  und  das  Alter  gegeben.  Man \nmuß  aber  nicht  denken,  daß  der  Baumeister  sich  einen \nPalast  errichtet  habe.  Es  ist  das  bescheidenste  Haus  von \nder  Welt,  hat  nur  zwei  Fenster,  die  durch  einen  breiten \nRaum,  der  das  dritte  Fenster  vertrüge,  abgesondert  sind. \nWollte  man  es  zumCiemälde  nachbilden,  so  daß  die  Nach- \nbarhäuser mit  vorgestellt  würden,  so  wäre  auch  das  ver- \ngnüglich anzusehen,  wie  es  zwischen  sie  eingeschaltet  ist. \nDas  hätte  Canaletto  malen  sollen. \n\nHeute  besuchte  ich  das  eine  halbe  Stunde  von  der  Stadt \nauf  einer  angenehmen  Höhe  liegende  Prachthaus,  die \nRotonda  genannt.  Es  ist  ein  viereckiges  Gebäude,  das \neinen  runden,  von  oben  erleuchteten  Saal  in  sich  schließt. \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  59 \n\nVon  allen  vier  Seiten  steigt  man  auf  breiten  Treppen \nhinan  und  gelangt  jedesmal  in  eine  Vorhalle,  die  von \nsechs  korinthischen  Säulen  gebildet  wird.  Vielleicht  hat \ndie  Baukunst  iliren  Luxus  niemals  höher  getrieben.  Der \nRaum,  den  die  Treppen  und  Vorhallen  einnehmen,  ist \nviel  größer  als  der  des  Hauses  selbst;  denn  jede  einzelne \nSeite  würde  als  Ansicht  eines  Tempels  befriedigen.  In- \nwendig kann  man  es  wohnbar,  aber  nicht  wohnlich \nnennen.  Der  Saal  ist  von  der  schönsten  Proportion,  die \nZimmer  auch;  aber  zu  den  Bedürfnissen  eines  Sommer- \naufenthalts einer  vornehmen  Familie  würden  sie  kaum \nhinreichen.  Dafür  sieht  man  es  auch  in  der  ganzen  Gegend, \nvon  allen  Seiten,  sich  auf  das  herrlichste  darstellen.  Die \nMannigfaltigkeit  ist  groß,  in  der  sich  seine  Hauptmasse \nzugleich  mit  den  vorspringenden  Säulen  vor  dem  Auge \nder  Umherwandelnden  bewegt,  und  die  Absicht  des  Be- \nsitzers ist  vollkommen  erreicht,  der  ein  großes  Fidei- \nkommißgut  und  zugleich  ein  sinnliches  Denkmal  seines \nVermögens  hinterlassen  wollte.  Und  wie  nun  das  Ge- \nbäude von  allen  Punkten  der  Gegend  in  seiner  Herrlich- \nkeit gesehen  wird,  so  ist  die  Aussicht  von  daher  gleich- \nfalls die  angenehmste.  Man  sieht  den  Bachiglione  fließen, \nSchifte  von  Verona  herab  gegen  die  Brenta  führend;  dabei \nüberschaut  man  die  weiten  Besitzungen,  welche  Marchese \nCapra  unzertrennt  bei  seiner  Familie  erhalten  wollte.  Die \nInschriften  der  vier  Giebelseiten,  die  zusammen  eine \nganze  ausmachen,  verdienen  wohl  aufgezeichnet  zu  werden: \nMarcus  Capra  Gabrielis  filius \nqui  aedes  has \narctissimo  primogeniturae  gradui  subjecit \nuna  cum  Omnibus \ncensibus  agris  vallibus  et  collibus \n\ncitra  viam  magnam \nmemoriae  perpetuae  mandans  haec \ndum  sustinet  ac  abstinet. \nDer  Schluß  besonders  ist  seltsam  genug:  ein  Mann,  dem \nso  viel  Vermögen  und  Wille  zu  Gebote  stand,  fühlt  noch, \ndaß  er  dulden  und  entbehren  müsse.    Das  kann  man  mit \ngerinsferm  Aufwand  lernen. \n\n\n6o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDen  22.  September. \nHeute  abend  war  ich  in  einer  Versammlung,  welche  die \nAkademie  der  Olympier  hielt.  Ein  Spielwerk,  aber  ein \nrecht  gutes;  es  erhält  noch  ein  bißchen  Salz  und  Leben \nunter  den  Leuten.  Ein  großer  Saal  neben  dem  Theater \ndes  Palladio,  anständig  erleuchtet,  der  Capitan  und  ein \nTeil  des  Adels  zugegen,  übrigens  durchaus  ein  Publikum \nvon  gebildeten  Personen,  viele  Geistliche,  zusammen  ohn- \ngefähr  fünfhundert. \n\nDie  von  dem  Präsidenten  für  die  heutige  Sitzung  auf- \ngegebene Frage  war:  ob  Erfindung  oder  Nachahmung  den \nschönen  Künsten  melir  Vorteil  gebracht  habe?  Der  Ein- \nfall war  glücklich  genug;  denn  wenn  man  die  in  der  Frage \nliegende  Alternative  trennt,  so  läßt  sich  hundert  Jahre \nhinüber  und  herüber  sprechen.  Auch  haben  sich  die \nHerrn  Akademiker  dieser  Gelegenheit  weidlich  bedient \nund  in  Prosa  und  Versen  mancherlei  hervorgebracht,  wor- \nunter viel  Gutes. \n\nSodann  ist  es  das  lebendigste  Publikum.  Die  Zuhörer \nriefen  bravo,  klatschten  und  lachten.  Wenn  man  auch \nvor  seiner  Nation  so  stehen  und  sie  persönlich  belustigen \ndürfte!  Wir  geben  unser  Bestes  schwarz  auf  weiß:  jeder \nkauzt  sich  damit  in  eine  Ecke  und  knopert  daran,  wie  er \nkann. \n\nEs  läßt  sich  denken,  daß  Palladio  auch  diesmal  an  allen \nOrten  und  Enden  war,  es  mochte  vom  Erfinden  oder \nNachahmen  die  Rede  sein.  Zuletzt,  wo  immer  das  Scherz- \nliafteste  gefordert  wird,  hatte  einer  den  glücklichen  Ein- \nfall, zu  sagen:  die  andern  hätten  ihm  den  Palladio  weg- \ngenommen, er  wolle  dagegen  den  Franceschini  loben, \nden  großen  Seidenfabrikanten.  Nun  fing  er  an,  zu  zeigen, \nwas  die  Nachahmung  der  Lyoner  und  Florentiner  Stoffe \ndiesem  tüchtigen  Unternehmer  und  durch  ihn  der  Stadt \nVicenza  für  Vorteil  gebracht  habe,  woraus  erfolge,  daß \ndie  Nachahmung  weit  über  die  Erfindung  erhaben  sei. \nUnd  dies  geschah  mit  so  gutem  Humor,  daß  ein  ununter- \nbrochenes Gelächter  erregt  ward.  Überhaupt  fanden  die, \nwelche  für  die  Nachahmung  sprachen,  mehr  Beifall;  denn \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  61 \n\nsie  sagten  lauter  Dinge,  wie  sie  der  Haufen  denkt  und \ndenken  kann.  Einmal  gab  das  Publikum  mit  großem \nHändeklatschen  einem  recht  groben  Sophism  seinen  herz- \nlichen Beifall,  da  es  viele  gute,  ja  treffliche  Sachen  zu \nEhren  der  Erfindung  nicht  gefühlt  hatte.  Es  freut  mich \nsehr,  auch  dieses  erlebt  zu  haben,  und  dann  ist  es  höchst \nerquickend,  den  Palladio  nach  so  viel  Zeit  immer  noch \nals  Polarstern  und  Musterbild  von  seinen  Mitbürgern  ver- \nehrt zu  sehen. \n\nVicenza^  den  23.  September. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  in  Tiene,  das  nordwärts  gegen  die \nGebirge  liegt,  wo  ein  neu  Gebäude  nach  einem  alten \nRisse  aufgeführt  wird,  wobei  wenig  zu  erinnern  sein \nmöchte.  So  ehrt  man  hier  alles  aus  der  guten  Zeit  und \nhat  Sinn  genug,  nach  einem  geerbten  Plan  ein  frisches \nGebäude  aufzuführen.  Das  Schloß  liegt  ganz  trefilich  in \neiner  großen  Plaine,  die  Kalkalpen  ohne  Zwischengebirg \nhinter  sich.  Vom  Gebäude  her,  neben  der  schnurgeraden \nChaussee,  fließt  zu  beiden  Seiten  lebendiges  Wasser  dem \nKommenden  entgegen  und  wässert  die  weiten  Reisfelder, \ndurch  die  man  fährt. \n\nIch  habe  nun  erst  die  zwei  italienischen  Städte  gesehen \nund  mit  wenig  Menschen  gesprochen,  aber  ich  kenne \nmeine  Italiener  schon  gut.  Sie  sind  wie  Hofleute,  die \nsich  fürs  erste  Volk  in  der  Welt  halten  und  bei  gewissen \nVorteilen,  die  man  ihnen  nicht  leugnen  kann,  sich's  un- \ngestraft und  bequem  einbilden  können.  Mir  erscheinen  die \nItaliener  als  eine  recht  gute  Nation:  man  muß  nur  die \nKinder  und  die  gemeinen  Leute  sehen,  wie  ich  sie  jetzt \nsehe  und  sehen  kann,  da  ich  ihnen  immer  ausgesetzt  bin \nund  mich  ihnen  immer  aussetze.  Und  was  das  für  Figuren \nund  Gesichter  sind! \n\nBesonders  muß  ich  die  Vicentiner  loben,  daß  man  bei \nihnen  die  Vorrechte  einer  großen  Stadt  genießt.  Sie  sehen \neinen  nicht  an,  man  mag  machen,  was  man  will;  wendet \nman  sich  jedoch  an  sie,  dann  sind  sie  gesprächig  und  an- \nmutig, besonders  wollen  mir  die  Frauen  sehr  gefallen. \nDie  Veroneserinnen  will  ich  nicht  schelten,  sie  haben  eine \n\n\n62  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngute  Bildung  und  entschiedeneProfile;  aber  meistens  bleich, \nund  der  Zendal  tut  ihnen  Schaden,  weil  man  unter  der \nschönen  Tracht  auch  etwas  Reizendes  sucht.  Hier  aber \nfinde  ich  gar  hübsche  Wesen,  besonders  eine  schwarz- \nlockige Sorte,  die  mir  ein  eigenes  Interesse  einflößt.  Es \ngibt  auch  noch  eine  blonde,  die  mir  aber  nicht  so  be- \nhagen will. \n\nPadiia^  den  26.  September  abends. \nIn  vier  Stunden  bin  ich  heute  von  Vicenza  herübergefahren, \nauf  ein  einsitziges  Chaischen,  Sediola  genannt,  mit  meiner, \nganzen  Existenz  gepackt.  Man  fährt  sonst  bequem  in  viert- \nhalb Stunden;  da  ich  aber  den  köstlichen  Tag  gern  unter \nfreiem  Himmel  genießen  wollte,  so  war  es  mir  angenehm, \ndaß  der  Vetturin  hinter  seiner  Schuldigkeit  zurückblieb. \nMan  fährt  in  der  fruchtbarsten  Ebene  immer  südostwärts, \nzwischen  Hecken  und  Bäumen,  ohne  weitere  Aussicht,  bis \nman  endlich  die  schönen  Gebirge,  von  Norden  gegen \nSüden  streichend,  zur  rechten  Hand  sieht.  Die  Fülle  der \nPflanzen-  und  Fruchtgehänge,  über  Mauern  und  Hecken, \nan  Bäumen  herunter,  ist  unbesclireiblich.  Kürbisse  be- \nschweren die  Dächer,  und  die  wunderlichsten  Gurken \nhängen  an  Latten  und  Spalieren. \n\nDie  herrliche  Lage  der  Stadt  konnte  ich  vom  Observa- \ntorium aufs  klarste  überschauen.  Gegen  Norden  Tiroler \nGebirge,  beschneit,  in  Wolken  halb  versteckt,  an  die \nsich  in  Nordwest  die  Vicentinischen  anschließen,  endlich \ngegen  Westen  die  näheren  Gebirge  von  Este,  deren  Ge- \nstalten und  Vertiefungen  man  deutlich  sehen  kann.  Gegen \nSüdost  ein  grünes  Pflanzenmeer,  ohne  eine  Spur  von \nErhöhung,  Baum  an  Baum,  Busch  an  Busch,  Pflanzung \nan  Pflanzung,  unzählige  weiße  Häuser,  Villen  und  Kirchen \naus  dem  Grünen  hervorblickend.  Am  Horizont  sah  ich \nganz  deutlich  den  Markusturm  zu  Venedig  und  andere \ngeringere  Türme. \n\nFadi/a^  den  27.  September. \nEndlich  hab'  ich  die  Werke  des  Palladio  erlangt,  zwar \nnicht  die  Originalausgabe,  die  ich  in  Vicenza  gesehen, \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  St, \n\nderen  Tafeln  in  Holz  geschnitten  sind,  aber  eine  genaue \nKopie,  ja  ein  Faksimile  in  Kupfer,  veranstaltet  durch  einen \nvortrefflichen  Mann,  den  ehemaligen  englischen  Konsul \nSmith  in  Venedig.  Das  muß  man  den  Engländern  lassen, \ndaß  sie  von  lange  her  das  Gute  zu  schätzen  wußten \nund  daß  sie  eine  grandiose  Art  haben,  es  zu  verbreiten. \nBei  Gelegenheit  dieses  Ankaufs  betrat  ich  einen  Buch- \nladen, der  in  Italien  ein  ganz  eigenes  Ansehen  hat.  Alle \nBücher  stehen  geheftet  umher,  und  man  findet  den  ganzen \nTag  über  gute  Gesellschaft.  Was  von  Weltgeistlichen, \nEdelleuten,  Künstlern  einigermaßen  mit  der  Literatur \nverwandt  ist,  geht  hier  auf  und  ab.  Man  verlangt  ein \nBuch,  schlägt  nach,  liest  und  unterhält  sich,  wie  es  kommen \nwill.  So  fand  ich  etwa  ein  halb  Dutzend  beisammen, \nwelche  sämtlich,  als  ich  nach  den  Werken  des  Palladio \nfragte,  auf  mich  aufmerksam  wurden.  Indes  der  Herr  des \nLadens  das  Buch  suchte,  rühmten  sie  es  und  gaben  mir \nNotiz  von  dem  Originale  und  der  Kopie;  sie  waren  mit \ndem  Werke  selbst  und  dem  Verdienst  des  Verfassers \nsehr  wohl  bekannt.  Da  sie  mich  für  einen  Architekten \nhielten,  lobten  sie  mich,  daß  ich  vor  allen  andern  zu  den \nStudien  dieses  Meisters  schritte;  er  leiste  zu  Gebrauch \nund  Anwendung  mehr  als  Vitruv  selbst,  denn  er  habe \ndie  Alten  und  das  Altertum  gründlich  studiert  und  es \nunsern  Bedürfnissen  näher  zu  führen  gesucht.  Ich  unter- \nhielt mich  lange  mit  diesen  freundlichen  Männern,  er- \nfuhr noch  einiges,  die  Denkwürdigkeiten  der  Stadt  be- \ntreffend, und  empfahl  mich. \n\nDa  man  denn  doch  einmal  den  Heiligen  Kirchen  gebaut \nhat,  so  findet  sich  auch  wohl  darin  ein  Platz,  wo  man \nvernünftige  Menschen  aufstellen  kann.  Die  Büste  des \nKardinals  Bembo  steht  zwischen  ionischen  Säulen,  ein \nschönes,  wenn  ich  so  sagen  soll  mit  Gewalt  in  sich  ge- \nzogenes Gesicht  und  ein  mächtiger  Bart;  die  Inschrift \nlautet: \n\nPetri  Bembi  Card,  imaginem  Hier.  Guerinus  Ismeni  f.  in \n\npublico  ponendam  curavit  ut  cujus  ingenii  monumenta \n\naeterna  sint  ejus  corporis  quoque  memoria  ne  a  poste- \n\nritate  desideretur. \n\n\n64  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDas  Universitätsgebäude  hat  mich  mit  aller  seiner  Würde \nerschreckt.  Es  ist  mir  lieb,  daß  ich  darin  nichts  zu  lernen \nhatte.  Eine  solche  Schulenge  denkt  man  sich  nicht,  ob \nman  gleich  als  Studiosus  deutscher  Akademien  auf  den \nHörbänken  auch  manches  leiden  müssen.  Besonders  ist \ndas  anatomische  Theater  ein  Muster,  wie  man  Schüler \nzusammenpressen  soll.  In  einem  spitzen  hohen  Trichter \nsind  die  Zuhörer  übereinander  geschichtet.  Sie  sehen \nsteil  herunter  auf  den  engen  Boden,  wo  der  Tisch  steht, \nauf  den  kein  Licht  fällt;  deshalb  der  Lehrer  bei  Lampen- \nschein demonstrieren  muß.  Der  botanische  Garten  ist \ndesto  artiger  und  munterer.  Es  können  viele  Pflanzen \nauch  den  Winter  im  Lande  bleiben,  wenn  sie  an  Mauern \noder  nicht  weit  davon  gesetzt  sind.  Man  überbaut  als- \ndann das  Ganze  zu  Ende  des  Oktobers  und  heizt  die \nwenigen  Monate.  Es  ist  erfreuend  und  belehrend,  unter \neiner  Vegetation  umherzugehen,  die  uns  fremd  ist.  Bei \ngewohnten  Pflanzen,  sowie  bei  andern  längst  bekannten \nGegenständen,  denken  wir  zuletzt  gar  nichts;  und  was  ist \nBeschauen  ohne  Denken?  Hier  in  dieser  neu  mir  ent- \ngegentretenden Mannigfaltigkeit  wird  jener  Gedanke \nimmer  lebendiger,  daß  man  sich  alle  Pflanzengestalten \nvielleicht  aus  ei7icr  entwickeln  könne.  Hierdurch  würde \nes  allein  möglich  werden,  Geschlechter  und  Arten  wahr- \nhaft zu  bestimmen,  welches,  wie  mich  dünkt,  bisher  sehr \nwillkürlich  geschieht.  Auf  diesem  Punkte  bin  ich  in  meiner \nbotanischen  Philosophie  stecken  geblieben,  und  ich  sehe \nnoch  nicht,  wie  ich  mich  entwirren  will.  Die  Tiefe  und \nBreite  dieses  Geschäfts  scheint  mir  völlig  gleich. \nDer  große  Platz,  Prato  della  Valle  genannt,  ist  ein  selir \nweiter  Raum,  wo  der  Hauptmarkt  im  Juni  gehalten  wird. \nHölzerne  Buden  in  seiner  Mitte  geben  freilich  nicht  das \nvorteilhafteste  Ansehen,  die  Einwohner  aber  versichern, \ndaß  man  auch  bald  hier  eine  Fiera  von  Stein,  wie  die \nzu  Verona,  sehen  werde.  Hiezu  gibt  freilich  schon  jetzt  die \nUmgebung  des  Platzes  gegründete  Hoftnung,  welche  einen \nsehr  schönen  und  bedeutenden  Anblick  gewährt. \nEin  ungeheures  Oval  ist  ringsum  mit  Statuen  besetzt,  alle \nberühmte  Männer  vorstellend,  welche  hier  gelehrt  und \n\n\nVERONA  BIS  VENEDIG  1786  65 \n\ngelernt  haben.  Einem  jeden  Einheimischen  und  Fremden \nist  erlaubt,  irgend  einem  Landsmann  oder  Verwandten \nhier  eine  Bildsäule  von  bestimmter  Größe  zu  errichten, \nsobald  das  Verdienst  der  Person  und  der  akademische \nAufenthalt  zu  Padua  bewiesen  ist. \n\nUm  das  Oval  umher  geht  ein  Wassergraben.  Auf  den \nvier  Brücken,  die  hinaufführen,  stehen  Päpste  und  Dogen \nkolossal;  die  übrigen,  kleiner,  sind  von  Zünften,  Partiku- \nliers  und  Fremden  gesetzt.  Der  König  von  Schweden \nließ  Gustav  Adolfen  hinstellen,  weil  man  sagt,  derselbe \nhabe  einmal  in  Padua  eine  Lektion  angehört.  Der  Erz- \nherzog Leopold  erneuerte  das  Andenken  Petrarchs  und \nGalileis.  Die  Statuen  sind  in  einer  braven  modernen \nManier  gemacht,  wenige  übermanieriert,  einige  recht \nnatürlich,  sämtlich  im  Kostüm  ihrer  Zeit  und  Würden. \nDie  Inschriften  sind  auch  zu  loben.  Es  findet  sich  nichts \nAbgeschmacktes  oder  Kleinliches  darunter. \nAuf  jeder  Universität  wäre  der  Gedanke  sehr  glücklich \ngewesen,  auf  dieser  ist  er  am  glücklichsten,  weil  es  sehr \nwohl  tut,  eine  völlige  Vergangenheit  wieder  hervorge- \nrufen zu  sehen.  Es  kann  ein  recht  schöner  Platz  werden, \nwenn  sie  die  hölzerne  Fiera  wegschafien  und  eine  von \nStein  erbauen,  wie  der  Plan  sein  soll. \n\nIn  dem  Versammlungsorte  einer  dem  heiligen  Antonius \ngewidmeten  Brüderschaft  sind  ältere  Bilder,  welche  an \ndie  alten  Deutschen  erinnern,  dabei  auch  einige  von \nTizian,  wo  schon  der  große  Fortschritt  merklich  ist,  den \nüber  den  Alpen  niemand  für  sich  getan  hat.  Gleich  dar- \nauf sah  ich  einiges  von  den  Neusten.  Diese  Künstler \nhaben,  da  sie  das  hohe  Ernste  nicht  mehr  erreichen \nkonnten,  das  Humoristische  sehr  glücklich  getroffen.  Die \nEnthauptung  Johannes'  von  Piazetta  ist,  wenn  man  des \nMeisters  Manier  zugibt,  in  diesem  Sinne  ein  recht  braves \nBild.  Johannes  kniet,  die  Hände  vor  sich  hinfaltend,  mit \ndem  rechten  Knie  an  einen  Stein.  Er  sieht  gen  Himmel. \nEin  Kriegsknecht,  der  ihn  hinten  gebunden  hält,  biegt \nsich  an  der  Seite  herum  und  sieht  ihm  ins  Gesicht,  als \nwenn  er  über  die  Gelassenheit  erstaunte,  womit  der  Mann \n\nGOETHE  IV  5 \n\n\n66  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich  hingibt.  In  der  Höhe  steht  ein  anderer,  der  den \nStreich  vollführen  soll,  hat  aber  das  Schwert  nicht,  son- \ndern macht  nur  mit  den  Händen  die  Gebärde,  wie  einer, \nder  den  Streich  zum  voraus  versuchen  will.  Das  Schwert \nzieht  unten  ein  dritter  aus  der  Scheide.  Der  Gedanke \nist  glücklich,  wenn  auch  nicht  groß,  die  Komposition \nfrappant  und  von  der  besten  Wirkung. \nIn  der  Kirche  der  Eremitaner  habe  ich  Gemälde  von \nMantegna  gesehen,  einem  der  älteren  Maler,  vor  dem \nich  erstaunt  bin.  Was  in  diesen  Bildern  für  eine  scharfe, \nsichere  Gegenwart  dasteht!  Von  dieser  ganz  wahren, \nnicht  etwa  scheinbaren,  eftektlügenden,  bloß  zur  Ein- \nbildungskraft sprechenden,  sondern  derben,  reinen,  lich- \nten, ausführlichen,  gewissenhaften,  zarten,  umschriebenen \nGegenwart,  die  zugleich  etwas  Strenges,  Emsiges,  Müh- \nsames hatte,  gingen  die  folgenden  Maler  aus,  wie  ich  an \nBildern  von  Tizian  bemerkte,  und  nun  konnte  die  Leb- \nhaftigkeit ihres  Genies,  die  Energie  ihrer  Natur,  erleuchtet \nvon  dem  Geiste  ihrer  Vorfahren,  auferbaut  durch  ihre \nKraft,  immer  höher  und  höher  steigen,  sich  von  der  Erde \nheben  und  himmlische,  aber  wahre  Gestalten  hervor- \nbringen. So  entwickelte  sich  die  Kunst  nach  der  bar- \nbarischen Zeit. \n\nDer  Audienzsaal  des  Rathauses,  mit  Recht  durch  das \nAugmentativum  \"Salone\"  betitelt,  das  ungeheuerste  abge- \nschlossene Gefäß,  das  man  sich  nicht  vorstellen,  auch \nnicht  einmal  in  der  nächsten  Erinnerung  ziu\"ückrufen  kann. \nDreihundert  Euß  lang,  hundert  Euß  breit  und  bis  in  das \nder  Länge  nach  ihn  deckende  Gewölbe  hundert  Euß \nhoch.  So  gewohnt  sind  diese  Menschen,  im  Freien  zu \nleben,  daß  die  Baumeister  einen  Marktplatz  zu  über- \nwölben fanden. \n\nUnd  es  ist  keine  Frage,  daß  der  ungeheuere  überwölbte \nRaum  eine  eigene  Empfindung  gibt.  Es  ist  ein  abge- \nschloßnes  Unendliches,  dem  ISlenschen  analoger  als  der \nSternhimmel.  Dieser  reißt  uns  aus  uns  selbst  hinaus, \njener  drängt  uns,  auf  die  gelindeste  Weise,  in  uns  selbst \nzurück. \nSo  verweil  ich    auch   gern  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  67 \n\nJustine.  Diese  ist  vierhundertfünfundachtzig  Fuß  lang, \nverhältnismäßig  hoch  und  breit,  groß  und  einfach  gebaut. \nHeut'  abend  setzt'  ich  mich  in  einen  Winkel  und  hatte \nmeine  stille  Betrachtung.  Da  fühlt'  ich  mich  recht \nallein,  denn  kein  Mensch  in  der  Welt,  der  in  dem  Augen- \nblick an  mich  gedacht  hätte,  würde  mich  hier  gesucht \nhaben. \n\nNun  wäre  auch  hier  wieder  einmal  eingepackt;  morgen \nfrüh  geht  es  zu  Wasser  auf  der  Brenta  fort.  Heute  hat's \ngeregnet,  nun  ist's  wieder  ausgehellt,  und  ich  hoffe,  die \nLagunen  und  die  dem  Meer  vermählte  Herrscherin  bei \nschöner  Tageszeit  zu  erblicken  und  aus  ihrem  Schoß \nmeine  Freunde  zu  begrüßen. \n\nVENEDIG \n\nSO  stand  es  denn  im  Buche  des  Schicksals  auf  meinem \nBlatte  geschrieben,  daß  ich  1786  den  achtundzwanzig- \nsten September,  abends,  nach  unserer  Uhr  um  fünfe, \nVenedig  zum  erstenmal,  aus  der  Brenta  in  die  Lagunen \neinfahrend,  erblicken  und  bald  darauf  diese  wunderbare \nInselstadt,  diese  Biberrepublik,  betreten  und  besuchen \nsollte.  So  ist  denn  auch,  Gott  sei  Dank,  Venedig  mir  kein \nbloßes  Wort  mehr,  kein  hohler  Name,  der  mich  so  oft, \nmich,  den  Todfeind  von  Wortschällen,  geängstiget  hat. \nAls  die  erste  Gondel  an  das  Schiff  anfuhr — es  geschieht, \num  Passagiere,  welche  Eil'  haben,  geschwinder  nach \nVenedig  zu  bringen — erinnerte  ich  mich  eines  frühen \nKinderspielzeuges,  an  das  ich  vielleicht  seit  zwanzig \nJahren  nicht  mehr  gedacht  hatte.  Mein  Vater  besaß  ein \nschönes  mitgebrachtes  Gondelmodell;  er  hielt  es  sehr \nwert,  und  mir  ward  es  hoch  angerechnet,  wenn  ich  ein- \nmal damit  spielen  durfte.  Die  ersten  Schnäbel  von  blankem \nEisenblech,  die  schwarzen  Gondelkäfige,  alles  grüßte  mich \nwie  eine  alte  Bekanntschaft,  ich  genoß  einen  langent- \nbehrten freundlichen  Jugendeindruck. \nIch  bin  gut  logiert  in  der  Königin  von  England,  nicht \nweit  vom  Markusplatze,  und  dies  ist  der  größte  Vorzug \ndes  Quartiers;  meine  Fenster  gehen  auf  einen  schmalen \n\n\n68  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nKanal  zwischen  hohen  Häusern,  gleich  unter  mir  eine \neinbogige  Brücke,  und  gegenüber  ein  schmales,  belebtes \nGäßchen.  So  wohne  ich,  und  so  werde  ich  eine  Zeitlang \nbleiben,  bis  mein  Paket  für  Deutschland  fertig  ist  und \nbis  ich  mich  am  Bilde  dieser  Stadt  satt  gesehen  habe. \nDie  Einsamkeit,  nach  der  ich  oft  so  sehnsuchtvoll  ge- \nseufzt, kann  ich  nun  recht  genießen;  denn  nirgends  fühlt \nman  sich  einsamer  als  im  Gewimmel,  wo  man  sich,  allen \nganz  unbekannt,  durchdrängt.  In  Venedig  kennt  mich \nvielleicht  nur  ein  Mensch,  und  der  wird  mir  nicht  gleich \nbegegnen. \n\nVenedig^  den  28.  September  j^86. \nWie  es  mir  von  Padua  hierher  gegangen,  nur  mit  wenig \nWorten:  Die  Fahrt  auf  der  Brenta,  mit  dem  öftentlichen \nSchiffe,  in  gesitteter  Gesellschaft,  da  die  Italiener  sich \nvoreinander  in  acht  nehmen,  ist  anständig  und  ange- \nnehm. Die  Ufer  sind  mit  Gärten  und  Lusthäusern  ge- \nschmückt; kleine  Ortschaften  treten  bis  ans  Wasser,  teil- \nweise geht  die  belebte  Landstraße  daran  hin.  Da  man \nschleusenweis  den  Fluß  hinabsteigt,  gibt  es  öfters  einen \nkleinen  Aufhalt,  den  man  benutzen  kann,  sich  auf  dem \nLande  umzusehen  und  die  reichlich  angebotenen  Früchte \nzu  genießen.  Nun  steigt  man  wieder  ein  und  bewegt \nsich  durch  eine  bewegte  Welt  voll  Fruchtbarkeit  und \nLeben. \n\nZu  so  viel  abwechselnden  Bildern  und  Gestalten  gesellte \nsich  noch  eine  Erscheinung,  die,  obgleich  aus  Deutsch- \nland abstammend,  doch  hier  ganz  eigentlich  an  ihrem \nPlatze  war,  zwei  Pilger  nämlich,  die  ersten,  die  ich  in \nder  Nähe  sah.  Sie  haben  das  Recht,  mit  dieser  öftent- \nlichen Gelegenheit  umsonst  weiter  gebracht  zu  werden; \nallein  weil  die  übrige  Gesellschaft  ihre  Nähe  scheut,  so \nsitzen  sie  nicht  mit  in  dem  bedeckten  Räume,  sondern \nhinten  bei  dem  Steuermann.  Als  eine  in  der  gegen- \nwärtigen Zeit  seltene  Erscheinung  wurden  sie  angestaunt \nund,  weil  früher  unter  dieser  Hülle  manch  Gesindel  um- \nhertrieb, wenig  geachtet.  Als  ich  vernahm,  daß  es  Deut- \nsche seien,  keiner  andern  Sprache  mächtig,  gesellte  ich \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  69 \n\nmich  zu  ihnen  und  vernahm,  daß  sie  aus  dem  Paderborni- \nschen herstammten.  Beides  waren  Männer  schon  über \nfünfzig,  von  dunkler,  aber  gutmütiger  Physiognomie.  Sie \nhatten  vor  allem  das  Grab  der  heiligen  drei  Könige  zu \nCöln  besucht,  waren  sodann  durch  Deutschland  gezogen \nund  nun  auf  dem  Wege,  zusammen  bis  Rom  und  sodann \nins  obere  Italien  zurückzugehen,  da  denn  der  eine  wieder \nnach  Westfalen  zu  wandern,  der  andere  aber  noch  den \nheiligen  Jakob  zu  Compostell  zu  verehren  gedachte. \nIhre  Kleidung  war  die  bekannte,  doch  sahen  sie  aufge- \nschürzt viel  besser  aus,  als  wir  sie  in  langen  Taffetkleidern \nauf  unsern  Redouten  vorzustellen  pflegen.  Der  große \nKragen,  der  runde  Hut,  der  Stab  und  die  Muschel,  als \ndas  unschuldigste  Trinkgeschirr,  alles  hatte  seine  Be- \ndeutung, seinen  unmittelbaren  Nutzen;  die  Blechkapsel \nenthielt  ihre  Pässe.  Das  Merkwürdigste  aber  waren  ihre \nkleinen  rotsaffianen  Brieftaschen;  in  diesen  befand  sich \nalles  kleine  Geräte,  was  nur  irgend  einem  einfachen  Be- \ndürfnis abzuhelfen  geeignet  sein  mochte.  Sie  hatten  die- \nselben hervorgezogen,  indem  sie  an  ihren  Kleidern  etwas \nzu  flicken  fanden. \n\nDer  Steuermann,  höchst  zufrieden,  daß  er  einen  Dol- \nmetscher fand,  ließ  mich  verschiedene  Fragen  an  sie  tun; \ndadurch  vernahm  ich  manches  von  ihren  Ansichten,  be- \nsonders aber  von  ihrer  Reise.  Sie  beklagten  sich  bitter- \nlich über  ihre  Glaubensgenossen,  ja  Weltpriester  und \nKlostergeistliche.  Die  Frömmigkeit,  sagten  sie,  müsse \neine  sehr  seltene  Sache  sein,  weil  man  an  die  ihrige  nir- \ngends glauben  wolle,  sondern  sie  fast  durchaus,  ob  sie \ngleich  die  ihnen  vorgeschriebene  geistliche  Marschroute \nimd  die  bischöflichen  Pässe  vorgezeigt,  in  katholischen \nLanden  wie  Landstreicher  behandle.  Sie  erzählten  da- \ngegen mit  Rührung,  wie  gut  sie  von  den  Protestanten \naufgenommen  worden,  besonders  von  einem  Landgeist- \nlichen in  Schwaben,  vorzüglich  aber  von  seiner  Frau, \nwelche  den  einigermaßen  widerstrebenden  Mann  dahin \nvermocht,  daß  sie  ihnen  reichliche  Erquickung  zuteilen \ndürfen,  welche  ihnen  sehr  not  getan.  Ja  beim  Abschiede \nhabe  sie  ihnen  einen  Konventionstaler  geschenkt,   der \n\n\n70  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nihnen  sehr  zustatten  gekommen,  sobald  sie  das  katho- \nlische Gebiet  wieder  betreten.  Hierauf  sagte  der  eine \nmit  aller  Erhebung,  deren  er  fähig  war:  Wir  schließen \ndiese  Frau  aber  auch  täglich  in  unser  Gebet  ein  und  bit- \nten Gott,  daß  er  ihre  Augen  öflhe,  wie  er  ihr  Herz  für \nuns  geöffnet  hat,  daß  er  sie,  wenn  auch  spät,  aufnehme \nin  den  Schoß  der  alleinseligmachenden  Kirche;  und  so \nhoffen  wir  gewiß,  ihr  dereinst  im  Paradies  zu  begegnen. \nVon  diesem  allen  erklärte  ich,  was  nötig  und  nützlich \nwar,  auf  der  kleinen  Steige  sitzend,  die  auf  das  Verdeck \nführt,  dem  Steuermanne  und  einigen  andern  Personen, \ndie  sich  aus  der  Kajüte  in  den  engen  Raum  gedrängt \nhatten.  Den  Pilgern  wurden  einige  ärmliche  Erquickun- \ngen gereicht,  denn  der  Italiener  liebt  nicht  zu  geben.  Sie \nzogen  hierauf  kleine  geweihte  Zettel  hervor,  worauf  zu \nsehen  das  Bild  der  heiligen  drei  Könige,  nebst  lateini- \nschen Gebeten  zur  Verehrung.  Die  guten  Menschen  baten \nmich,  die  kleine  Gesellschaft  damit  zu  beschenken  und \nihr  den  hohen  Wert  dieser  Blätter  begreiflich  zu  machen. \nDieses  gelang  mir  auch  ganz  gut,  denn  als  die  beiden \nMänner  sehr  verlegen  schienen,  wie  sie  in  dem  großen \nVenedig  das  zur  Aufnahme  der  Pilger  bestimmte  Kloster \nausfinden  sollten,  so  versprach  der  gerührte  Steuermann, \nwenn  sie  landeten,  wollte  er  einem  Burschen  sogleich \neinen  Dreier  geben,  damit  er  sie  zu  jenem  entfernt  ge- \nlegenen Orte  geleitete.  Sie  würden  zwar,  setzte  er  ver- \ntraulich hinzu,  sie  würden  dort  wenig  Trost  finden:  die \nAnstalt,  sehr  groß  angelegt,  um  ich  weiß  nicht  wie  viel \nPilger  zu  fassen,  sei  gegenwärtig  ziemlich  zusammen- \ngegangen, und  die  Einkünfte  würden  eben  anders  ver- \nwendet. \n\nSo  unterhalten,  waren  wir  die  schöne  Brenta  herunter- \ngekommen, manchen  herrlichen  Garten,  manchen  herr- \nlichen Palast  hinter  uns  lassend,  wohlhabende,  belebte \nOrtschaften  an  der  Küste  mit  flüchtigem  Blick  beschauend. \nAls  wir  nun  in  die  Lagunen  einfuhren,  umschwärmten \nmehrere  Gondeln  sogleich  das  SchiÖ\".  Ein  Lombard,  in \nVenedig  wohl  bekannt,  forderte  mich  auf,  ihm  Gesell- \nschaft zu  leisten,  damit  wir  geschwinder  drinne  wären \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  71 \n\nund  der  Doganenqual  entgingen.  Einige,  die  uns  ab- \nhalten wollten,  wußte  er  mit  einem  mäßigen  Trinkgeld \nzu  beseitigen,  und  so  schwammen  wir,  bei  einem  heitern \nSonnenuntergang,  schnell  unserm  Ziel  entgegen. \n\nDen  2g.  Septet?iber,  Michaelistag  abends. \nVon  Venedig  ist  schon  viel  erzählt  und  gedruckt,  daß  ich \nmit  Beschreibung  nicht  umständlich  sein  will;  ich  sage \nnur,  wie  es  mir  entgegenkömmt.  Was  sich  mir  aber  vor \nallem  andern  aufdringt,  ist  abermals  das  Volk,  eine  große \nMasse,  ein  notwendiges  unwillkürliches  Dasein. \nDieses  Geschlecht  hat  sich  nicht  zum  Spaß  auf  diese  In- \nseln geflüchtet;  es  war  keine  Willkür,  welche  die  Fol- \ngenden trieb,  sich  mit  ihnen  zu  vereinigen:  die  Not  lehrte \nsie  ihre  Sicherheit  in  der  unvorteilhaftesten  Lage  suchen, \ndie  ihnen  nachher  so  vorteilhaft  ward  und  sie  klug  machte, \nals  noch  die  ganze  nördliche  Welt  im  Düstern  gefangen \nlag;  ihre  Vermehrung,  ihr  Reichtum  war  notwendige \nFolge.  Nun  drängten  sich  die  Wohnungen  enger  und \nenger,  Sand  und  Sumpf  wurden  durch  Felsen  ersetzt; \ndie  Häuser  suchten  die  Luft,  wie  Bäume,  die  geschlossen \nstehen:  sie  mußten  an  Höhe  zu  gewinnen  suchen,  was \nihnen  an  Breite  abging.  Auf  jede  Spanne  des  Bodens \ngeizig  und  gleich  anfangs  in  enge  Räume  gedrängt,  ließen \nsie  zu  Gassen  nicht  mehr  Breite,  als  nötig  war,  eine \nHausreihe  von  der  gegenüberstehenden  zu  trennen  und \ndem  Bürger  notdürftige  Durchgänge  zu  erhalten.  Übri- \ngens war  ihnen  das  Wasser  statt  Straße,  Platz  und  Spa- \nziergang. Der  Venezianer  mußte  eine  neue  Art  von  Ge- \nschöpf werden,  wie  man  denn  auch  Venedig  nur  mit  sich \nselbst  vergleichen  kann.  Der  große  schlangenförmig  ge- \nwundene Kanal  weicht  keiner  Straße  in  der  Welt,  dem \nRaum  vor  dem  Markusplatze  kann  wohl  nichts  an  die \nSeite  gesetzt  werden:  ich  meine  den  großen  Wasserspiegel, \nder  diesseits  von  dem  eigentlichen  Venedig  im  halben \nMond  umfaßt  wird.  Über  der  Wasserfläche  sieht  man \nlinks  die  Insel  San  Giorgio  Maggiore,  etwas  weiter  rechts \ndie  Giudecca  und  ihren  Kanal,  noch  weiter  rechts  die \nDogane  und  die  Einfahrt  in  den  Canal  Grande,  wo  uns \n\n\n72  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngleich  ein  paar  ungeheure  Marmortempel  entgegenleuch- \nten. Dies  sind  mit  wenigen  Zügen  die  Hauptgegenstände, \ndie  uns  in  die  Augen  fallen,  wenn  wir  zwischen  den  zwei \nSäulen  des  Markusplatzes  hervortreten.  Die  sämtlichen \nAus-  und  Ansichten  sind  so  oft  in  Kupfer  gestochen,  daß \ndie  Freunde  davon  sich  gar  leicht  einen  anschaulichen \nBegriff  machen  können. \n\nNach  Tische  eilte  ich,  mir  erst  einen  Eindruck  des  Gan- \nzen zu  versichern,  und  warf  mich,  ohne  Begleiter,  nur \ndie  Himmelsgegenden  merkend,  ins  Labyrinth  der  Stadt, \nwelche,  obgleich  durchaus  von  Kanälen  und  Kanälchen \ndurchschnitten,  durch  Brücken  und  Brückchen  wieder  zu- \nsammenhängt. Die  Enge  und  Gedrängtheit  des  Ganzen \ndenkt  man  nicht,  ohne  es  gesehen  zu  haben.  Gewöhnlich \nkann  man  die  Breite  der  Gasse  mit  ausgereckten  Armen \nentweder  ganz  oder  beinahe  messen,  in  den  engsten  stößt \nman  schon  mit  den  Ellbogen  an,  wenn  man  die  Hände \nin  die  Seite  stemmt;  es  gibt  wohl  breitere,  auch  hie  und \nda  ein  Plätzchen,  verhältnismäßig  aber  kann  alles  enge \ngenannt  werden. \n\nIch  fand  leicht  den  großen  Kanal  und  die  Hauptbrücke \nRialto;  sie  besteht  aus  einem  einzigen  Bogen  von  weißem \nMarmor.  Von  oben  herunter  ist  es  eine  große  Ansicht: \nder  Kanal  gesäet  voll  Schiffe,  die  alles  Bedürfnis  vom \nfesten  Lande  herbeiführen  und  hier  hauptsächlich  anlegen \nund  ausladen;  dazwischen  wimmelt  es  von  Gondeln.  Be- \nsonders heute,  als  am  Michaelisfeste,  gab  es  einen  An- \nblick wunderschön  lebendig;  doch  um  diesen  einiger- \nmaßen darzustellen,  muß  ich  etwas  weiter  ausholen. \nDie  beiden  Hauptteile  von  Venedig,  welche  der  große \nKanal  trennt,  werden  durch  die  einzige  Brücke  Rialto \nmiteinander  verbunden,  doch  ist  auch  für  mehrere  Kom- \nmunikation gesorgt,  welche,  in  offenen  Barken,  an  be- \nstimmten Überfahrtspunkten  geschieht.  Nun  sah  es  heute \nsehr  gut  aus,  als  die  wohlgekleideten,  doch  mit  einem \nschwarzen  Schleier  bedeckten  Frauen  sich,  viele  zusam- \nmen, übersetzen  ließen,  um  zu  der  Kirche  des  gefeierten \nErzengels  zu  gelangen.  Ich  verließ  die  Brücke  und  be- \ngab  mich  an  einen  solchen  Überfahrtspunkt,  die  Aus- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  73 \n\nsteigenden  genau  zu  betrachten.  Ich  habe  sehr  schöne \nGesichter  und  Gestalten  darunter  gefunden. \nNachdem  ich  müde  geworden,  setzte  ich  mich  in  eine \nGondel,  die  engen  Gassen  verlassend,  und  fuhr,  mir  das  ent- \ngegengesetzte Schauspiel  zu  bereiten,  den  nördlichen  Teil \ndes  großen  Kanals  durch,  um  die  Insel  der  heiligen  Klara, \nin  die  Lagunen,  den  Kanal  der  Giudecca  herein,  bis  ge- \ngen den  Markusplatz,  und  war  nun  auf  einmal  ein  Mit- \nherr des  Adriatischen  Meeres,  wie  jeder  Venezianer  sich \nfühlt,  wenn  er  sich  in  seine  Gondel  legt.  Ich  gedachte  dabei \nmeines  guten  Vaters  in  Ehren,  der  nichts  Besseres  wußte, \nals  von  diesen  Dingen  zu  erzählen.  Wird  mir's  nicht  auch \nso  gehen?  Alles,  was  mich  umgibt,  ist  würdig,  ein  großes \nrespektables  Werk  versammelter  Menschenkraft,  ein  herr- \nliches Monument,  nicht  eines  Gebieters,  sondern  eines \nVolks.  Und  wenn  auch  ihre  Lagunen  sich  nach  und  nach \nausfüllen,  böse  Dünste  über  dem  Sumpfe  schweben,  ihr \nHandel  geschwächt,  ihre  Macht  gesunken  ist,  so  wird \ndie  ganze  Anlage  der  Republik  und  ihr  Wesen  nicht \neinen  Augenblick  dem  Beobachter  weniger  ehrwürdig \nsein.  Sie  unterliegt  der  Zeit,  wie  alles,  was  ein  erschei- \nnendes Dasein  hat. \n\nDen  30.  September. \nGegen  Abend  verlief  ich  mich  wieder,  ohne  Führer,  in \ndie  entferntesten  Quartiere  der  Stadt.  Die  hiesigen  Brük- \nken  sind  alle  mit  Treppen  angelegt,  damit  Gondeln  und \nauch  wohl  größere  Schiffe  bequem  unter  den  Bogen  hin- \nfahren. Ich  suchte  mich  in  und  aus  diesem  Labyrinthe \nzu  finden,  ohne  irgend  jemand  zu  fragen,  mich  abermals \nnur  nach  der  Himmelsgegend  richtend.  Man  entwirrt \nsich  wohl  endlich,  aber  es  ist  ein  unglaubliches  Gehecke \nineinander,  und  meine  Manier,  sich  recht  sinnlich  da- \nvon zu  überzeugen,  die  beste.  Auch  habe  ich  mir,  bis \nan  die  letzte  bewohnte  Spitze,  der  Einwohner  Betragen, \nLebensart,  Sitte  und  Wesen  gemerkt;  in  jedem  Quartiere \nsind  sie  anders  beschaffen.  Du  lieber  Gott!  was  doch \nder  Mensch  für  ein  armes,  gutes  Tier  ist! \nSehr  viele  Häuserchen  stehen  unmittelbar  in  den  Ka- \n\n\n74  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nnälen;  doch  gibt  es  hie  und  da  schön  gepflasterte  Stein- \ndämnie,  auf  denen  man  zwischen  Wasser,  Kirchen  und \nPalästen  gar  angenehm  hin  und  wieder  spaziert.  Lustig \nund  erfreuhch  ist  der  lange  Steindamm  an  der  nördlichen \nSeite,  von  welchem  die  Inseln,  besonders  Murano,  das \nVenedig  im  kleinen,  geschaut  werden.  Die  Lagunen  da- \nzwischen sind  von  vielen  Gondeln  belebt. \n\nAbends. \nHeute  habe  ich  abermals  meinen  Begriff  von  Venedig \nerweitert,  indem  ich  mir  den  Plan  verschaffte.  Als  ich \nihn  einigermaßen  studiert,  bestieg  ich  den  Markusturm, \nwo  sich  dem  Auge  ein  einziges  Schauspiel  darstellt.  Es \nwar  um  Mittag  und  heller  Sonnenschein,  daß  ich  ohne \nPerspektiv  Nähen  und  Fernen  genau  erkennen  konnte. \nDie  Flut  bedeckte  die  Lagunen,  und  als  ich  den  Blick \nnach  dem  sogenannten  Lido  wandte — es  ist  ein  schmaler \nErdstreif,  der  die  Lagunen  schließt — sah  ich  zum  ersten- \nmal das  Meer  und  einige  Segel,  darauf.  In  den  Lagunen \nselbst  liegen  Galeeren  und  Fregatten,  die  zum  Ritter  Emo \nstoßen  sollten,  der  den  Algierern  den  Krieg  macht,  die \naber  wegen  ungünstiger  Winde  liegen  bleiben.  Die  Padu- \nanischen  und  Vicentinischen  Berge  und  das  Tiroler  Ge- \nbirge schließen,  zwischen  Abend  und  Mitternacht,  das \nBild  ganz  trefflich  schön. \n\nDen  I.  Oktober. \nIch  ging  und  besah  mir  die  Stadt  in  mancherlei  Rück- \nsichten, und  da  es  eben  Sonntag  war,  fiel  mir  die  große \nUnreinlichkeit  der  Straßen  auf,  worüber  ich  meine  Be- \ntrachtungen anstellen  mußte.  Es  ist  wohl  eine  Art  von \nPolizei  in  diesem  Artikel:  die  Leute  schieben  den  Keh- \nricht in  die  Ecken;  auch  sehe  ich  große  Schiffe  hin  und \nwieder  fahren,  die  an  manchen  Orten  stille  liegen  und \ndas  Kehricht  mitnehmen,  Leute  von  den  Inseln  umher, \nwelche  des  Düngers  bedürfen;  aber  es  ist  in  diesen  An- \nstalten weder  Folge  noch  Strenge  imd  desto  unverzeih- \nlicher die  Unreinlichkeit  der  Stadt,  da  sie  ganz  zur  Rein- \nlichkeit angelegt  worden,  so  gut  als  irgend  eine  hol- \nländische. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  75 \n\nAlle  Straßen  sind  geplattet,  selbst  die  entferntesten \nQuartiere  wenigstens  mit  Backsteinen  auf  der  hohen \nKante  ausgesetzt,  wo  es  nötig,  in  der  Mitte  ein  wenig \nerhaben,  an  der  Seite  Vertiefungen,  das  Wasser  aufzu- \nfassen und  in  bedeckte  Kanäle  zu  leiten.  Noch  andere \narchitektonische  Vorrichtungen  der  ersten  wohlüberdach- \nten Anlage  zeugen  von  der  Absicht  trefflicher  Baumeister, \nVenedig  zu  der  reinsten  Stadt  zu  machen,  wie  sie  die \nsonderbarste  ist.  Ich  konnte  nicht  unterlassen,  gleich \nim  Spaziergehen  eine  Anordnung  deshalb  zu  entwerfen \nund  einem  Polizeivorsteher,  dem  es  Ernst  wäre,  in  Ge- \ndanken vorzuarbeiten.  So  hat  man  immer  Trieb  und  Lust, \nvor  fremden  Türen  zu  kehren. \n\nDen  2.  Oktober. \nVor  allem  eilte  ich  in  die  Caritä:  ich  hatte  in  des  Pal- \nladio  Werken  gefunden,  daß  er  hier  ein  Klostergebäude \nangegeben,  in  welchem  er  die  Privatwohnung  der  reichen \nund  gastfreien  Alten  darzustellen  gedachte.  Der  sowohl \nim  ganzen  als  in  seinen  einzelnen  Teilen  trefflich  ge- \nzeichnete Plan  machte  mir  unendliche  Freude,  und  ich \nhofi'te  ein  Wunderwerk  zu  finden;  aber  ach!  es  ist  kaum \nder  zehnte  Teil  ausgeführt;  doch  auch  dieser  Teil  seines \nhimmlischen  Genius  würdig,  eine  Vollkommenheit  in  der \nAnlage  und  eine  Genauigkeit  in  der  Ausführung,  die  ich \nnoch  nicht  kannte.  Jahrelang  sollte  man  in  Betrachtung \nso  eines  Werks  zubringen.  Mich  dünkt,  ich  habe  nichts \nHöheres,  nichts  Vollkommneres  gesehen,  und  glaube,  daß \nich  mich  nicht  irre.  Denke  man  sich  aber  auch  den \ntrefflichen  Künstler,  mit  dem  Innern  Sinn  fürs  Große \nund  Gefällige  geboren,  der  erst  mit  unglaublicher  Mühe \nsich  an  den  Alten  heranbildet,  um  sie  alsdann  durch  sich \nwiederherzustellen.  Dieser  findet  Gelegenheit,  einen  Lieb- \nlingsgedanken auszuführen,  ein  Kloster,  so  vielen  Mön- \nchen zur  Wohnung,  so  vielen  Fremden  zur  Herberge \nbestimmt,  nach  der  Form  eines  antiken  Privatgebäudes \naufzurichten. \n\nDie  Kirche  stand  schon;  aus  ihr  tritt  man  in  ein  Atrium \nvon  korinthischen  Säulen,  man  ist  entzückt  und  vergißt \n\n\n76  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nauf  einmal  alles  Pfaffentum.  An  der  einen  Seite  findet \nman  die  Sakristei,  an  der  andern  ein  Kapitelzimmer, \ndaneben  die  schönste  Wendeltreppe  von  der  Welt,  mit \noffener  weiter  Spindel,  die  steinernen  Stufen  in  die  Wand \ngemauert  und  so  geschichtet,  daß  eine  die  andere  trägt; \nman  wird  nicht  müde,  sie  auf  und  ab  zu  steigen;  wie \nschön  sie  geraten  sei,  kann  man  daraus  abnehmen,  daß \nsie  Palladio  selbst  für  wohlgeraten  angibt.  Aus  dem  Vor- \nhof tritt  man  in  den  innern  großen  Hof.  Von  dem  Ge- \nbäude, das  ihn  umgeben  sollte,  ist  leider  nur  die  linke \nSeite  aufgeführt,  drei  Säulenordnungen  übereinander,  auf \nder  Erde  Hallen,  im  ersten  Stock  ein  Bogengang  vor  den \nZellen  hin,  der  obere  Stock  Mauer  mit  Fenstern.  Doch \ndiese  Beschreibung  muß  durch  den  Anblick  der  Risse  ge- \nstärkt werden.  Nun  ein  Wort  von  der  Ausführung. \nNur  die  Häupter  und  Füße  der  Säulen  und  die  Schluß- \nsteine der  Bogen  sind  von  gehauenem  Stein,  das  übrige \nalles,  ich  darf  nicht  sagen  von  Backsteinen,  sondern  von \ngebranntem  Ton.  Solche  Ziegeln  kenne  ich  gar  nicht. \nFries  und  Karnies  sind  auch  daraus,  die  Glieder  der  Bo- \ngen gleichfalls,  alles  teilweise  gebrannt  und  das  Gebäude \nzuletzt  nur  mit  wenig  Kalk  zusammengesetzt.  Es  steht \nwie  aus  einem  Guß.  'Wäre  das  Ganze  fertig  geworden \nund  man  sähe  es  reinlich  abgerieben  und  gefärbt,  es \nmüßte  ein  himmlischer  Anblick  sein. \nJedoch  die  Anlage  war  zu  groß,  wie  bei  so  manchem  Gebäude \nder  neuern  Zeit.  Der  Künstler  hatte  nicht  nur  vorausge- \nsetzt, daß  man  das  jetzige  Kloster  abreißen,  sondern  auch \nanstoßende  Nachbarshäuser  kaufen  werde;  und  da  mögen \nGeld  und  Lust  ausgegangen  sein.  Du  liebes  Schicksal,  das \ndu  so  manche  Dummheit  begünstigt  und  verewigt  hast, \nwarum  ließest  du  dieses  Werk  nicht  zustande  kommen! \n\nDen  s-  Oktober. \nDie  Kirche  II  Redentore,  ein  schönes  großes  Werk  von \nPalladio,  die  Fassade  lobenswürdiger  als  die  von  San \nGiorgio.  Diese  mehrmals  in  Kupfer  gestochenen  Werke \nmüßte  man  vor  sich  sehen,  um  das  Gesagte  verdeutlichen \nzu  können.    Hier  nur  wenige  Worte. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  77 \n\nPalladio  war  durchaus  von  der  Existenz  der  Alten  durch- \ndrungen und  fühlte  die  Kleinheit  und  Enge  seiner  Zeit \nwie  ein  großer  Mensch,  der  sich  nicht  hingeben,  sondern \ndas  übrige  so  viel  als  möglich  nach  seinen  edlen  Be- \ngrifien  umbilden  will.  Er  war  unzufrieden,  wie  ich  aus \ngelinder  Wendung  seines  Buches  schließe,  daß  man  bei \nchristlichen  Kirchen  nach  der  Form  der  alten  Basiliken \nzu  bauen  fortfahre:  er  suchte  deshalb  seine  heiligen  Ge- \nbäude der  alten  Tempelform  zu  nähern;  daher  ent- \nstanden gewisse  Unschicklichkeiten,  die  mir  bei  II  Reden- \ntore glücklich  beseitigt,  bei  San  Giorgio  aber  zu  auffallend \nerscheinen.  Volkmann  sagt  etwas  davon,  trifft  aber  den \nNagel  nicht  auf  den  Kopf. \n\nInwendig  ist  II  Redentore  gleichfalls  köstlich,  alles,  auch \ndie  Zeichnung  der  Altäre,  von  Palladio;  leider  die  Ni- \nschen, die  mit  Statuen  ausgefüllt  werden  sollten,  prangen \nmit  flachen,  ausgeschnittenen,  gemalten  Brettfiguren. \n\nDem  heiligen  Franziskus  zu  Ehren  hatten  die  Patres \nKapuziner  einen  Seitenaltar  mächtig  ausgeputzt:  man \nsah  nichts  von  Stein  als  die  korinthischen  Kapitale; \nalles  übrige  schien  mit  einer  geschmackvollen  prächtigen \nStickerei,  nach  Art  der  Arabesken,  überzogen,  und  zwar \nso  artig,  als  man  nur  etwas  zu  sehen  wünschte.  Beson- \nders wunderte  ich  mich  über  die  breiten,  goldgestickten \nRanken  und  Laubwerke.  Ich  ging  näher  und  fand  einen \nrecht  hübschen  Betrug.  Alles,  was  ich  für  Gold  gehalten \nhatte^  war  breitgedrücktes  Stroh,  nach  schönen  Zeich- \nnungen auf  Papier  geklebt,  der  Grund  mit  lebhaften  Far- \nben angestrichen,  und  das  so  mannigfaltig  und  ge- \nschmackvoll, daß  dieser  Spaß,  dessen  Material  gar  nichts \nwert  war  und  der  wahrscheinlich  im  Kloster  selbst  aus- \ngeführt wurde,  mehrere  tausend  Taler  müßte  gekostet \nhaben,  wenn  er  echt  hätte  sein  sollen.  Man  könnte  es \ngelegentlich  wohl  nachahmen. \n\nAuf  einem  Uferdamme,  im  Angesicht  des  Wassers,  be- \nmerkte ich  schon  einigemal  einen  geringen  Kerl,  welcher \neiner  größern  oder  kleinern  Anzahl  von  Zuhörern  im \nvenezianischen  Dialekt   Geschichten  erzählte;  ich  kann \n\n\n78  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nleider  nichts  davon  verstehen;  es  lacht  aber  kein  Mensch, \nnur  selten  lächelt  das  Auditorium,  das  meist  aus  der  ganz \nniedern  Klasse  besteht.  Auch  hat  der  Mann  nichts  Auf- \nfallendes noch  Lächerliches  in  seiner  Art,  vielmehr  et- \nwas sehr  Gesetztes,  zugleich  eine  bewundrungswürdige \nMannigfaltigkeit  und  Präzision,  welche  auf  Kunst  und \nNachdenken  hinwiesen,  in  seinen  Gebärden. \n\nDen  Plan  in  der  Hand,  suchte  ich  mich  durch  die  wunder- \nlichsten Irrgänge  bis  zur  Kirche  der  Mendicanti  zu  finden. \nHier  ist  das  Konservatorium,  welches  gegenwärtig  den \nmeisten  Beifall  hat.  Die  Frauenzimmer  fühj-ten  ein  Ora- \ntorium hinter  dem  Gitter  auf,  die  Kirche  war  voll  Zu- \nhörer, die  Musik  sehr  schön,  und  herrliche  Stimmen.  Ein \nAlt  sang  den  König  Saul,  die  Hauptperson  des  Gedichtes. \nVon  einer  solchen  Stimme  hatte  ich  gar  keinen  Begriff; \neinige  Stellen  der  Musik  waren  unendlich  schön,  der  Text \nvollkommen  singbar,  so  italienisch  Latein,  daß  man  an \nmanchen  Stellen  lachen  muß;  die  Musik  aber  findet  hier \nein  weites  Feld. \n\nEs  wäre  ein  trefflicher  Genuß  gewesen,  wenn  nicht  der \nvermaledeite  Kapellmeister  den  Takt  mit  einer  Rolle \nNoten  wider  das  Gitter  und  so  unverschämt  geklappt \nhätte,  als  habe  er  mit  Schuljungen  zu  tun,  die  er  eben \nunterrichtete;  und  die  Mädchen  hatten  das  Stück  oft \nwiederholt,  sein  Klatschen  war  ganz  unnötig  und  zerstörte \nallen  Eindruck,  nicht  anders  als  wenn  einer,  um  uns  eine \nschöne  Statue  begreiflich  zu  machen,  ihr  Scharlachläpp- \nchen auf  die  Gelenke  klebte.  Der  fremde  Schall  hebt  alle \nHarmonie  auf.  Das  ist  nun  ein  Musiker,  und  er  hört  es  nicht, \noder  er  will  vielmehr,  daß  man  seine  Gegenwart  durch \neine  Unschicklichkeit  vernehmen  soll,  da  es  besser  wäre, \ner  ließe  seinen  Wert  an  der  Vollkommenheit  der  Ausführung \nerraten.  Ich  weiß,  die  Franzosen  haben  es  an  der  Art; \nden  Italienern  hätte  ich  es  nicht  zugetraut,  und  das  Publi- \nkum scheint  daran  gewöhnt.  Es  ist  nicht  das  einzige  Mal, \ndaß  es  sich  einbilden  läßt,  das  gerade  gehöre  zum  Genuß, \nwas  den  Genuß  verdirbt. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  79 \n\nGestern  abend  Oper  zu  St.  Moses  (denn  die  Theater  haben \nihren  Namen  von  der  Kirche,  der  sie  am  nächsten  liegen); \nnicht  recht  erfreuUch!  Es  fehlt  dem  Poem,  der  Musik, \nden  Sängern  eine  innere  Energie,  welche  allein  eine  solche \nDarstellung  auf  den  höchsten  Punkt  treiben  kann.  Man \nkonnte  von  keinem  Teile  sagen,  er  sei  schlecht;  aber  nur \ndie  zwei  Frauen  ließen  sich's  angelegen  sein,  nicht  so- \nwohl gut  zu  agieren  als  sich  zu  produzieren  und  zu  ge- \nfallen. Das  ist  denn  immer  etwas.  Es  sind  zwei  schöne \nFiguren,  gute  Stimmen,  artige,  muntere,  gätliche  Per- \nsönchen.  Unter  den  Männern  dagegen  keine  Spur  von \ninnerer  Gewalt  und  Lust,  dem  Publikum  etwas  aufzuheften, \nsowie  keine  entschieden  glänzende  Stimme. \nDas  Ballett,  von  elender  Erfindung,  ward  im  ganzen  aus- \ngepfififen,  einige  treöliche  Springer  und  Springerinnen \njedoch,  welche  letztere  sich  es  zur  Pflicht  rechneten,  die \nZuschauer  mit  jedem  schönen  Teil  ihres  Körpers  bekannt \nzu  machen,  wurden  weidlich  beklatscht. \n\nHeute  dagegen  sah  ich  eine  andere  Komödie,  die  mich \nmehr  gefreut  hat.  Im  herzoglichen  Palast  hörte  ich  eine \nRechtssache  öfientlich  verhandeln;  sie  war  wichtig  und \nzu  meinem  Glück  in  den  Ferien  vorgenommen.  Der  eine \nAdvokat  war  aUes,  was  ein  übertriebener  BufFo  nur  sein \nsollte.  Figur  dick,  kurz,  doch  beweglich,  ein  ungeheuer \nvorspringendes  Profil,  eine  Stimme  wie  Erz  und  eine \nHeftigkeit,  als  wenn  es  ihm  aus  tiefstem  Grunde  des \nHerzens  Ernst  wäre,  was  er  sagte.  Ich  nenne  dies  eine \nKomödie,  weil  alles  wahrscheinlich  schon  fertig  ist,  wenn \ndiese  öffentliche  Darstellung  geschieht:  die  Richter  wissen, \nwas  sie  sprechen  sollen,  und  die  Partei  weiß,  was  sie  zu \nerwarten  hat.  Indessen  gefällt  mir  diese  Art  unendlich \nbesser  als  unsere  Stuben-  und  Kanzleihockereien.  Und \nnun  von  den  Umständen,  und  wie  artig,  ohne  Prunk,  wie \nnatürlich  alles  zugeht,  will  ich  suchen  einen  Begriff  zu \ngeben. \n\nIn  einem  geräumigen  Saal  des  Palastes  saßen  an  der  einen \nSeite  die  Richter  im  Halbzirkel.  Gegen  ihnen  über,  auf \neinem  Katheder,  der  mehrere  Personen  nebeneinander \n\n\n8o  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nfassen  konnte,  die  Advokaten  beider  Parteien;  unmittel- \nbar vor  demselben,  auf  ei7:er  Bank,  Kläger  und  Beklagte \nin  eigner  Person.  Der  Advokat  des  Klägers  war  von  dem \nKatheder  herabgestiegen,  denn  die  heutige  Sitzung  war \nzu  keiner  Kontrovers  bestimmt.  Die  sämtlichen  Doku- \nmente für  und  wider,  obgleich  schon  gedruckt,  sollten \nvorgelesen  werden. \n\nEin  hagerer  Schreiber,  in  schwarzem  kümmerlichen  Rocke, \nein  dickes  Heft  in  der  Hand,  bereitete  sich,  die  Pflicht \ndes  Lesenden  zu  erfüllen.  Von  Zuschauern  und  Zuhörern \nwar  übrigens  der  Saal  gedrängt  voll.  Die  Rechtsfrage \nselbst  sowie  die  Personen,  welche  sie  betraf,  mußten  den \nVenezianern  höchst  bedeutend  scheinen. \nFideikommisse  haben  in  diesem  Staat  die  entschiedenste \nGunst:  ein  Besitztum,  welchem  einmal  dieser  Charakter \naufgeprägt  ist,  behält  ihn  für  ewige  Zeiten;  es  mag  durch \nirgend  eine  Wendung  oder  Umstand  vor  mehrern  hundert \nJahren  veräußert  worden,  durch  viele  Hände  gegangen \nsein,  zuletzt,  wenn  die  Sache  zur  Sprache  kommt,  be- \nhalten die  Nachkommen  der  ersten  Familie  recht,  und \ndie  Güter  müssen  herausgegeben  werden. \nDiesmal  war  der  Streit  höchst  wichtig,  denn  die  Klage \nging  gegen  den  Doge  selbst  oder  vielmehr  gegen  seine \nGemahlin,  welche  denn  auch  in  Person  auf  dem  Bänkchen, \nvom  Kläger  nur  durch  einen  kleinen  Zwischenraum  ge- \ntrennt, in  ihren  Zendal  gehüllt  dasaß.  Eine  Dame  von \ngewissem  Alter,  edlem  Körperbau,  wohlgebildetem  Ge- \nsicht, auf  welchem  ernste,  ja  wenn  man  will  etwas  ver- \ndrießliche Züge  zu  sehen  waren.  Die  Venezianer  bildeten \nsich  viel  darauf  ein,  daß  die  Fürstin,  in  ilirera  eignen \nPalast,  vor  dem  Gericht  und  ihnen  erscheinen  müsse. \nDer  Schreiber  fing  zu  lesen  an,  und  nun  ward  mir  erst \ndeutlich,  was  ein  im  Angesicht  der  Richter,  unfern  des \nKatheders  der  Advokaten,  hinter  einem  kleinen  Tische \nauf  einem  niedern  Schemel  sitzendes  Männchen,  besonders \naber  die  Sanduhr  bedeute,  die  er  vor  sich  niedergelegt \nhatte.  Solange  nämlich  der  Schreiber  liest,  so  lange \nläuft  die  Zeit  nicht;  dem  Advokaten  aber,  wenn  er  dabei \nsprechen  will,  ist  nur  im  ganzen  eine  gewisse  Frist  ge- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  81 \n\ngönnt.  Der  Schreiber  liest,  die  Uhr  liegt,  das  Männchen \nhat  die  Hand  daran.  Tut  der  Advokat  den  Mund  auf,  so \nsteht  auch  die  Uhr  schon  in  der  Höhe,  die  sich  sogleich \nniedersenkt,  sobald  er  schweigt.  Hier  ist  nun  die  große \nKunst,  in  den  Fluß  der  Vorlesung  hineinzureden,  flüchtige \nBemerkungen  zu  machen,  Aufmerksamkeit  zu  erregen  und \nzu  fordern.  Nun  kommt  der  kleine  Saturn  in  die  größte \nVerlegenheit.  Er  ist  genötigt,  den  horizontalen  und  ver- \ntikalen Stand  der  Uhr  jeden  Augenblick  zu  verändern,  er \nbefindet  sich  im  Fall  der  bösen  Geister  im  Puppenspiel, \ndie  auf  das  schnell  wechselnde  Berlicke!  Berlocke!  des \nmutwilligen  Hanswursts  nicht  wissen,  wie  sie  gehen  oder \nkommen  sollen. \n\nWer  in  Kanzleien  hat  kollationieren  hören,  kann  sich  eine \nVorstellung  von  dieser  Vorlesung  machen,  schnell,  ein- \ntönig, aber  doch  artikuliert  und  deutlich  genug.  Der \nkunstreiche  Advokat  weiß  nun  durch  Scherze  die  Lange- \nweile zu  unterbrechen,  und  das  Publikum  ergötzt  sich  an \nseinen  Spaßen  in  ganz  unmäßigem  Gelächter.  Eines \nScherzes  muß  ich  gedenken,  des  auffallendsten  unter \ndenen,  die  ich  verstand.  Der  Vorleser  rezitierte  soeben \nein  Dokument,  wodurch  einer  jener  unrechtmäßig  ge- \nachteten Besitzer  über  die  fraglichen  Güter  disponierte. \nDer  Advokat  hieß  ihn  langsamer  lesen,  und  als  er  die \nWorte  deutlich  aussprach:  Ich  schenke^  ich  vermache^  fuhr \nder  Redner  heftig  auf  den  Schreiber  los  und  rief:  Was \nwillst  du  schenken?  was  vermachen?  du  armer  ausge- \nhungerter Teufel!  Gehört  dir  doch  gar  nichts  in  der  Welt \nan.  Doch,  fuhr  er  fort,  indem  er  sich  zu  besinnen  schien, \nwar  doch  jener  erlauchte  Besitzer  in  eben  dem  Fall,  er \nwollte  schenken,  wollte  vermachen,  was  ihm  so  wenig \ngehörte  als  dir.  Ein  unendlich  Gelächter  schlug  auf,  doch \nsogleich  nahm  die  Sanduhr* die  horizontale  Lage  wieder \nan.  Der  Vorleser  summte  fort,  machte  dem  Advokaten  ein \nflämisch  Gesicht;  doch  das  sind  alles  verabredete  Spaße. \n\nDen  4.  Oktober. \nGestern  war  ich  in  der  Komödie,  Theater  St.  Lukas,  die \nmir  viel  Freude  gemacht  hat:  ich  sah  ein  extemporiertes \n\nGOETHE  IV  6 \n\n\n82  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nStück  in  Masken,  mit  viel  Naturell,  Energie  und  Bravour \naufgeführt.  Freilich  sind  sie  nicht  alle  gleich;  der  Pan- \ntalon  sehr  brav,  die  eine  Frau,  stark  und  wohlgebaut, \nkeine  außerordentliche  Schauspielerin,  spricht  exzellent \nund  weiß  sich  zu  betragen.  Ein  tolles  Sujet,  demjenigen \nähnlich,  das  bei  uns  unter  dem  Titel  ''Der  Verschlag''  be- \nhandelt ist.  Mit  unglaublicher  Abwechslung  unterhielt  es \nmehr  als  drei  Stunden.  Doch  ist  auch  hier  das  Volk \nwieder  die  Base,  worauf  dies  alles  ruht:  die  Zuschauer \nspielen  mit,  und  die  Menge  verschmilzt  mit  dem  Theater \nin  ein  Ganzes.  Den  Tag  über  auf  dem  Platz  und  am \nUfer,  auf  den  Gondeln  und  im  Palast,  der  Käufer  und \nVerkäufer,  der  Bettler,  der  Schiffer,  die  Nachbarin,  der \nAdvokat  und  sein  Gegner,  alles  lebt  und  treibt  und  läßt \nsich  es  angelegen  sein,  spricht  und  beteuert,  schreit  und \nbietet  aus,  singt  und  spielt,  flucht  und  lärmt.  Und  abends \ngehen  sie  ins  Theater  und  sehen  und  hören  das  Leben \nihres  Tages,  künstlich  zusammengestellt,  artiger  aufge- \nstutzt, mit  Märchen  durchflochten,  durch  Masken  von  der \nWirklichkeit  abgerückt,  durch  Sitten  genähert.  Hierüber \nfreun  sie  sich  kindisch,  schreien  wieder,  klatschen  und \nlärmen.  Von  Nacht  zu  Nacht,  ja  von  Mitternacht  zu \nMitternacht  ist  immer  alles  eben  dasselbe. \nIch  habe  aber  auch  nicht  leicht  natürlicher  agieren  sehen \nals  jene  Masken,  so  wie  es  nur  bei  einem  ausgezeichnet \nglücklichen  Naturell  durch  längere  Übung  erreicht  werden \nkami. \n\nDa  ich  das  schreibe,  machen  sie  einen  gewaltigen  T^ärm \nauf  dem  Kanal  unter  meinem  Fenster,  und  Mitternacht  ist \nvorbei.  Sie  haben  im  Guten  und  Bösen  immer  etwas  zu- \nsammen. \n\nÖffentliche  Redner  habe  ich  nun  gehört:  drei  Kerls  auf \ndem  Platze  und  Ufersteindamme,  jeden  nach  seiner  Art \nGeschichten  erzählend,  sodann  zwei  Sachwalter,  zwei \nPrediger,  die  Schauspieler,  worunter  ich  besonders  den \nPantalon  rühmen  muß;  alle  diese  haben  etwas  Gemein- \nsames, sowohl  weil  sie  von  ein  und  derselben  Nation  sind, \ndie,  stets  öftentlich  lebend,  immer  in  leidenschaftlichem \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  83 \n\nSprechen  begriffen  ist,  als  auch  weil  sie  sich  untereinander \nnachahmen.  Hierzu  kommt  noch  eine  entschiedene  Ge- \nbärdensprache, mit  welcher  sie  die  Ausdrücke  ihrer  Inten- \ntionen, Gesinnungen  und  Empfindungen  begleiten. \nHeute  am  Fest  des  heiligen  Franziskus  war  ich  in  seiner \nKirche  alle  Vigne.  Des  Kapuziners  laute  Stimme  ward \nvon  dem  Geschrei  der  Verkäufer  vor  der  Kirche  wie  von \neiner  Antiphone  begleitet;  ich  stand  in  der  Kirchtüre \nzwischen  beiden,  und  es  war  wunderlich  genug  zu  hören. \n\nDen  j.  Oktober. \nHeute  früh  war  ich  im  Arsenal,  mir  immer  interessant \ngenug,  da  ich  noch  kein  Seewesen  kenne  und  hier  die \nuntere  Schule  besuchte:  denn  freilich  sieht  es  hier  nach \neiner  alten  Familie  aus,  die  sich  noch  rührt,  obgleich  die \nbeste  Zeit  der  Blüte  und  der  Früchte  vorüber  ist.  Da  ich \ndenn  auch  den  Handwerkern  nachgehe,  habe  ich  manches \nMerkwürdige  gesehen  und  ein  Schiff  von  vierundachtzig \nKanonen,  dessen  Gerippe  fertig  steht,  bestiegen. \nEin  gleiches  ist  vor  sechs  Monaten,  an  der  Riva  de' \nSchiavoni,  bis  aufs  Wasser  verbrannt;  die  Pulverkammer \nwar  nicht  sehr  gefüllt,  und  da  sie  sprang,  tat  es  keinen \ngroßen  Schaden.  Die  benachbarten  Häuser  büßten  ihre \nScheiben  ein. \n\nDas  schönste  Eichenholz,  aus  Istrien,  habe  ich  verarbeiten \nsehen  und  dabei  über  den  Wachstum  dieses  werten  Baumes \nmeine  stillen  Betrachtungen  angestellt.  Ich  kann  nicht \ngenug  sagen,  was  meine  sauer  erworbene  Kenntnis  natür- \nlicher Dinge,  die  doch  der  Mensch  zuletzt  als  Materialien \nbraucht  und  in  seinen  Nutzen  verwendet,  mir  überall  hilft, \num  mir  das  Verfahren  der  Künstler  und  Handwerker  zu \nerklären;  so  ist  mir  auch  die  Kenntnis  der  Gebirge  und \ndes  daraus  genommenen  Gesteins  ein  großer  Vorsprung \nin  der  Kunst. \n\nUm  mit  einem  Worte  den  Begriff  des  Bucentaur  auszu- \nsprechen, nenne  ich  ihn  eine  Prachtgaleere.  Der  ältere, \nvon  dem  wir  noch  Abbildungen  haben,  rechtfertigt  diese \n\n\n84  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nBenennung  noch  mehr  als  der  gegenwärtige,  der  uns  durch \nseinen  Glanz  über  seinen  Ursprung  verblendet. \nIch  komme  immer  auf  mein  Altes  zurück.  Wenn  dem \nKünstler  ein  echter  Gegenstand  gegeben  ist,  so  kann  er \netwas  Echtes  leisten.  Hier  war  ihm  aufgetragen,  eine \nGaleere  zu  bilden,  die  wert  wäre,  die  Häupter  der  Repu- \nblik, am  feierlichsten  Tage,  zum  Sakrament  ihrer  herge- \nbrachten Meerherrschaft  zu  tragen,  und  diese  Aufgabe  ist \nfürtreft'lich  au.sgeführt.  Das  Schiff  ist  ganz  Zierat,  also \ndarf  man  nicht  sagen:  mit  Zierat  überladen;  ganz  ver- \nguldetes  Schnitzwerk,  sonst  zu  keinem  Gebrauch,  eine \nwahre  Monstranz,  um  dem  Volke  seine  Häupter  recht \nherrlich  zu  zeigen.  Wissen  wir  doch:  das  Volk,  wie  es \ngern  seine  Hüte  schmückt,  will  auch  seine  Obern  prächtig \nund  geputzt  sehen.  Dieses  Prunkschiff  ist  ein  rechtes  In- \nventarienstück,  woran  man  sehen  kann,  was  die  Vene- \nzianer waren  und  sich  zu  sein  dünkten. \n\nNac/its. \nIch  komme  noch  lachend  aus  der  Tragödie  und  muß \ndiesen  Scherz  gleich  auf  dem  Papier  befestigen.  Das \nStück  war  nicht  schlimm,  der  Verfasser  hatte  alle  tragischen \nMatadore  zusammengesteckt,  und  die  Schauspieler  hatten \ngut  spielen.  Die  meisten  Situationen  waren  bekannt, \neinige  neu  und  ganz  glücklich.  Zwei  Väter,  die  sich  hassen. \nSöhne  und  Töchter  aus  diesen  getrennten  Familien,  leiden- \nschaftlich übers  Kreuz  verliebt,  ja  das  eine  Paar  heimUch \nverheiratet.  Es  ging  wild  und  grausam  zu,  und  nichts \nblieb  zuletzt  übrig,  um  die  jungen  Leute  glücklich  zu \nmachen,  als  daß  die  beiden  Väter  sich  erstachen,  worauf \nunter  lebhaftem  Händeklatschen  der  Vorhang  fiel.  Nun \nward  aber  das  Klatschen  heftiger,  nun  wurde  Fuora  ge- \nrufen, und  das  so  lange,  bis  sich  die  zwei  Hauptpaare \nbequemten,  hinter  dem  Vorhang  hervorzukriechen,  ihre \nl)ücklinge  zu  machen  und  auf  der  andern  Seite  wieder  ab- \nzugehen. \n\nDas  Publikum  war  noch  nicht  befriedigt,  es  klatschte  fort \nund  rief  I  morti!  Das  dauerte  so  lange,  bis  die  zwei \nToten  auch  herauskamen  und  sich  bückten,  da  denn  einige \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  85 \n\nStimmen  riefen  Bravi  i  morti!  Sie  wurden  durch  Klatschen \nlange  festgehalten,  bis  man  ihnen  gleichfalls  endlich  ab- \nzugehen erlaubte.  Diese  Posse  gewinnt  für  den  Augen- \nund  Ohrenzeugen  unendlich,  der  das  Bravo!  Bravi!  das \ndie  Italiener  immer  im  Munde  führen,  so  in  den  Ohren \nhat  wie  ich,  und  dann  auf  einmal  auch  die  Toten  mit \ndiesem  Ehrenwort  anrufen  hört. \n\nGute  Nacht!  so  können  wir  Nordländer  zu  jeder  Stunde \nsagen,  wenn  wir  im  Finstern  scheiden;  der  Italiener  sagt \nFelicissima  notte!  nur  einmal,  und  zwar  wenn  das  Licht \nin  das  Zimmer  gebracht  wird,  indem  Tag  und  Nacht  sich \nscheiden,  und  da  heißt  es  denn  etwas  ganz  anderes.  So \nunübersetzlich  sind  die  Eigenheiten  jeder  Sprache:  denn \nvom  höchsten  bis  zum  tiefsten  Wort  bezieht  sich  alles \nauf  Eigentümlichkeiten  der  Nation,  es  sei  nun  in  Cha- \nrakter, Gesinnungen  oder  Zuständen. \n\nDc7i  6.  Oktober. \nDie  Tragödie  gestern  hat  mich  manches  gelehrt.  Erst- \nlich habe  ich  gehört,  wie  die  Italiener  ihre  eilfsilbigen \nJamben  behandeln  und  deklamieren;  dann  habe  ich  be- \ngriffen, wie  klug  Gozzi  die  Masken  mit  den  tragischen \nFiguren  verbunden  hat.  Das  ist  das  eigentliche  Schau- \nspiel für  dieses  Volk:  denn  es  will  auf  eine  krude  Weise \ngerührt  sein,  es  nimmt  keinen  innigen,  zärtlichen  Anteil \nam  Unglücklichen,  es  freut  sie  nur,  wenn  der  Held  gut \nspricht;  denn  aufs  Reden  halten  sie  viel,  sodann  aber \nwollen  sie  lachen  oder  etwas  Albernes  vornehmen. \nIhr  Anteil  am  Schauspiel  ist  nur  als  an  einem  Wirklichen. \nDa  der  Tyrann  seinem  Sohne  das  Schwert  reichte  und \nforderte,  daß  dieser  seine  eigne  gegenüberstehende  Ge- \nmahlin umbringen  sollte,  fing  das  Volk  laut  an,  sein  Miß- \nvergnügen über  diese  Zumutung  zu  beweisen,  und  es \nfehlte  nicht  viel,  so  wäre  das  Stück  unterbrochen  worden. \nSie  verlangten,  der  Alte  sollte  sein  Schwert  zurückneh- \nmen, wodurch  denn  freilich  die  folgenden  Situationen \ndes  Stücks  wären  aufgehoben  worden.  Endlich  entschloß \nsich  der  bedrängte  Sohn,  trat  ins  Proszenium  und  bat \ndemütig,   sie  möchten  sich  nur  noch  einen  Augenblick \n\n\n86  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\ngedulden,  die  Sache  werde  noch  ganz  nach  Wunsch  ab- \nlaufen. Künstlerisch  genommen  aber  war  diese  Situation \nnach  den  Umständen  albern  und  unnatürlich,  und  ich  lobte \ndas  Volk  um  sein  Gefühl. \n\nJetzt  verstehe  ich  besser  die  langen  Reden  und  das  viele \nHin-  und  Herdissertieren  im  griechischen  Trauerspiele. \nDie  Athenienser  hörten  noch  lieber  reden  und  verstanden \nsich  noch  besser  darauf  als  die  Italiener;  vor  den  Ge- \nrichtsstellen, wo  sie  den  ganzen  Tag  lagen,  lernten  sie \nschon  etwas. \n\nAn  den  ausgeführten  Werken  Palladios,  besonders  an \nden  Kirchen,  habe  ich  manches  Tadelnswürdige  neben \ndem  Köstlichsten  gefunden.  Wenn  ich  nun  so  bei  mir \nüberlegte,  inwiefern  ich  recht  oder  unrecht  hätte  gegen \neinen  solchen  außerordentlichen  Mann,  so  war  es,  als  ob \ner  dabei  stünde  und  mir  sagte:  das  und  das  habe  ich \nwider  Willen  gemacht,  aber  doch  gemacht,  weil  ich  unter \nden  gegebenen  Umständen  nur  auf  diese  Weise  meiner \nhöchsten  Idee  am  näch.sten  kommen  konnte. \nMir  scheint,  soviel  ich  auch  darüber  denke,  er  habe  bei \nBetrachtung  der  Höhe  und  Breite  einer  schon  bestehenden \nKirche,  eines  altern  Hauses,  wozu  er  Fassaden  errichten \nsollte,  nur  überlegt:  wie  gibst  du  diesen  Räumen  die \ngrößte  Form.-  im  einzelnen  mußt  du,  wegen  eintretenden \nBedürfnisses,  etwas  verrücken  oder  verpfuschen,  da  oder \ndort  wird  eine  Unschicklichkeit  entstehen;  aber  das \nmag  sein,  das  Ganze  wird  einen  hohen  Stil  haben,  und \ndu  wirst  dir  zur  Freude  arbeiten. \n\nUnd  so  hat  er  das  größte  Bild,  das  er  in  der  Seele  trug, \nauch  dahin  gebracht,  wo  es  nicht  ganz  paßte,  wo  er  es \nim  einzelnen  zerknittern  und  verstümmeln  mußte. \nDer  Flügel  in  der  Caritä  dagegen  muß  uns  deshalb  von \nso  hohem  Werte  sein,  weil  der  Künstler  freie  Hand  hatte \nund  seinem  Geist  unbedingt  folgen  durfte.  Wäre  das \nKloster  fertig  geworden,  so  stünde  vielleicht  in  der  ganzen \ngegenwärtigen  Welt  kein  vollkommneres  Werk  der  Bau- \nkunst. \nWie  er  gedacht  und  wie  er  gearbeitet,  wird  mir  immer \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  87 \n\nklarer,  je  mehr  ich  seine  Werke  lese  und  dabei  betrachte, \nwie  er  die  Alten  behandelt;  denn  er  macht  wenig  Worte, \nsie  sind  aber  alle  gewichtig.  Das  vierte  Buch,  das  die \nantiken  Tempel  darstellt,  ist  eine  rechte  Einleitung,  die \nalten  Reste  mit  Sinn  zu  beschauen. \n\nDen  7.  Oktober. \nGestern  abend  sah  ich  Elektra  von  Crebillon,  auf  dem \nTheater  San  Crisostomo,  nämlich  übersetzt.  Was  mir  das \nStück  abgeschmackt  vorkam  und  wie  es  mir  fürchterlich \nLangeweile  machte,  kann  ich  nicht  sagen. \nDie  Akteurs  sind  übrigens  brav  und  wissen  das  Publikum \nmit  einzelnen  Stellen  abzuspeisen!  Orest  hat  allein  drei \nverschiedene  Erzählungen,  poetisch  aufgestutzt,  in  eii?cr \nSzene.  Elektra,  ein  hübsches  Weibchen  von  mittlerer \nGröße  und  Stärke  und  fast  französischer  Lebhaftigkeit, \neinem  guten  Anstand,  spricht  die  Verse  schön;  nur  be- \ntrug sie  sich  von  Anfang  bis  zu  Ende  toll,  wie  es  leider \ndie  Rolle  verlangt.  Indessen  habe  ich  doch  wieder  ge- \nlernt. Der  italienische,  immer  eilfsilbige  Jambe  hat  für \ndie  Deklamation  große  Unbequemlichkeit,  weil  die  letzte \nSilbe  durchaus  kurz  ist  und,  wider  Willen  des  Deklama- \ntors, in  die  Höhe  schlägt. \n\nHeute  früh  war  ich  bei  dem  Hochamte,  welchem  der \nDoge  jährlich  an  diesem  Tage,  wegen  eines  alten  Siegs \nüber  die  Türken,  in  der  Kirche  der  heiligen  Justina  bei- \nwohnen muß.  Wenn  an  dem  kleinen  Platz  die  vergolde- \nten Barken  landen,  die  den  Fürsten  und  einen  Teil  des \nAdels  bringen,  seltsam  gekleidete  Schiffer  sich  mit  rot \ngemalten  Bmdern  bemühen,  am  Ufer  die  Geistlichkeit,  die \nBrüdersch:ni\"ten  mit  angezündeten,  auf  Stangen  und  trag- \nbare silbeere  Leuchter  gesteckten  Kerzen  stehen,  drängen, \nwogen  'raue  warten,  dann  mit  Teppichen  beschlagene \nBrücker  Rühiden  Fahrzeugen  ans  Land  gestreckt  werden, \nzuerst  lein  Angen  violetten  Kleider  der  Savj,  dann  die \nlangersce,  e  der  Senatoren  sich  auf  dem  Pflaster  ent- \nfalten jhte,  da:  der  Alte,  mit  goldener  phrygischer  Mütze \ngeschilalamocan  längsten  goldenen  Talar,  mit  dem  Her- \n\n\n88  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nmelinmantel,  aussteigt,  drei  Diener  sich  seiner  Schleppe \nbemächtigen,  alles  auf  einem  kleinen  Platz  vor  dem  Portal \neiner  Kirche,  vor  deren  Türen  die  Türkenfahnen  gehal- \nten werden,  so  glaubt  man  auf  einmal  eine'  alte  gewirkte \nTapete  zu  sehen,  aber  recht  gut  gezeichnet  und  koloriert. \nMir  nordischem  Flüchtling  hat  diese  Zeremonie  viele \nFreude  gemacht.  Bei  uns,  wo  alle  Feierlichkeiten  kurz- \nröckig  sind  und  wo  die  größte,  die  man  sich  denken  kann, \nmit  dem  Gewehr  auf  der  Schulter  begangen  wird,  möchte \nso  etwas  nicht  am  Ort  sein.  Aber  hierher  gehören  diese \nSchleppröcke,  diese  friedlichen  Begehungen. \nDer  Doge  ist  ein  gar  schön  gewachsener  und  schön  ge- \nbildeter Mann,  der  krank  sein  mag,  sich  aber  nur  noch \nso,  um  der  Würde  willen,  unter  dem  schweren  Rocke \ngerade  hält.  Sonst  sieht  er  aus  wie  der  Großpapa  des \nganzen  Geschlechts  und  ist  gar  hold  und  leutselig;  die \nKleidung  steht  sehr  gut,  das  Käppchen  unter  der  Mütze \nbeleidigt  nicht,  indem  es,  ganz  fein  und  dui-chsichtig,  auf \ndem  weißesten,  klarsten  Haar  von  der  Welt  ruht. \nEtwa  fünfzig  Nobili,  in  langen  dunkelroten  Schleppklei- \ndern, waren  mit  ihm,  meist  schöne  Männer,  keine  einzige \nvertrackte  Gestalt,  mehrere  groß,  mit  großen  Köpfen, \ndenen  die  blonden  Lockenperücken  wohl  ziemten;  vorge- \nbaute Gesichter,  weiches,  weißes  Fleisch,  ohne  schwam- \nmig und  widerwärtig  auszusehen,  vielmehr  klug,  ohne \nAnstrengung,  ruhig,  ihrer  selbst  gewiß,  Leichtigkeit  des \nDaseins  und  durchaus  eine  gewisse  Fröhlichkeit. \nWie  sich  alles  in  der  Kirche  rangiert  hatte  und  das \nHochamt  anfing,  zogen  die  Brüderschaften  zur  Haupttüre \nherein  und  zur  rechten  Seitentüre  wieder  hinaus,  nach- \ndem sie,  Paar  für  Paar,  das  Weihwasser  empfangen  und \nsich  gegen  den  Hochaltar,  den  Dogen  und  den(  Adel  ge- \nneigt hatten.  i \n\nAuf  heute  abend  hatte  ich  mir  den  famosen  Gesang  der \nSchiffer  bestellt,  die  den  Tasso  und  Ariost  auf  ihre  eignen \nMelodien  singen.  Dieses  muß  wirklich  bestellt  werden, \nes  kommt  nicht  gewöhnlich  vor,  es  gehört  vielmehr  zu \nden  halbverklungenen  Sagen  der  Vorzeit.    Bei  Monden- \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  89 \n\nschein  bestieg  ich  eine  Gondel,  den  einen  Sänger  vorn, \nden  andern  hinten;  sie  fingen  ihr  Lied  an  und  sangen \nabwechselnd  Vers  für  Vers.  Die  Melodie,  welche  wir \ndurch  Rousseau  kennen,  ist  eine  Mittelart  zwischen  Choral \nund  Rezitativ,  sie  behält  immer  denselben  Gang,  ohne \nTakt  zu  haben;  die  Modulation  ist  auch  dieselbige,  nur \nverändern  sie,  nach  dem  Inhalt  des  Verses,  mit  einer  Art \nvon  Deklamation  sowohl  Ton  als  Maß;  der  Geist  aber, \ndas  Leben  davon,  läßt  sich  begreifen  wie  folgt. \nAuf  welchem  Wege  sich  die  Melodie  gemacht  hat,  will \nich  nicht  untersuchen,  genug,  sie  paßt  gar  trefflich  für \neinen  müßigen  Menschen,  der  sich  etwas  vormoduliert \nund  Gedichte,  die  er  auswendig  kann,  solchem  Gesang \nunterschiebt. \n\nMit  einer  durchdringenden  Stimme — das  Volk  schätzt \nStärke  vor  allem — sitzt  er  am  Ufer  einer  Insel,  eines \nKanals,  auf  einer  Barke  und  läßt  sein  Lied  schallen,  so \nweit  er  kann.  Über  den  stillen  Spiegel  verbreitet  sich's. \nIn  der  Ferne  vernimmt  es  ein  anderer,  der  die  Melodie \nkennt,  die  Worte  versteht  und  mit  dem  folgenden  Verse \nantwortet;  hierauf  erwidert  der  erste,  und  so  ist  einer \nimmer  das  Echo  des  andern.  Der  Gesang  währt  Nächte \ndurch,  unterhält  sie,  ohne  zu  ermüden.  Je  ferner  sie  also \nvoneinander  sind,  desto  reizender  kann  das  Lied  werden; \nwenn  der  Hörer  alsdann  zwischen  beiden  steht,  so  ist  er \nam  rechten  Flecke. \n\nUm  dieses  mich  vernehmen  zu  lassen,  stiegen  sie  am \nUfer  der  Giudecca  aus;  sie  teilten  sich  am  Kanal  hin,  ich \nging  zwischen  ihnen  auf  und  ab,  so  daß  ich  immer  den \nverließ,  der  zu  singen  anfangen  sollte,  und  mich  dem- \njenigen wieder  näherte,  der  aufgehört  hatte.  Da  ward \nmir  der  Sinn  des  Gesangs  erst  aufgeschlossen.  Als  Stimme \naus  der  Feme  klingt  es  höchst  sonderbar,  wie  eine  Klage \nohne  Trauer;  es  ist  darin  etwas  unglaublich,  bis  zu \nTränen  Rührendes.  Ich  schrieb  es  meiner  Stimmung  zu; \naber  mein  Alter  sagte:  6  singolare,  come  quel  canto  in- \ntenerisce,  e  molto  piü,  quando  e  piü  ben  cantato.  Er \nwünschte,  daß  ich  die  Weiber  vom  Lido,  besonders  die \nvon  Malamocco  und  Palestrina  hören  möchte;  auch  diese \n\n\n90  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsängen  den  Tasso  auf  gleiche  und  ähnliche  Melodien. \nEr  sagte  ferner:  Sie  haben  die  Gewohnheit,  wenn  ihre \nMänner  aufs  Fischen  ins  Meer  sind,  sich  ans  Ufer  zu \nsetzen  und  mit  durchdringender  Stimme  abends  diese \nGesänge  erschallen  zu  lassen,  bis  sie  auch  von  ferne  die \nStimme  der  Ihrigen  vernehmen  und  sich  so  mit  ihnen \nunterhalten.  Ist  das  nicht  sehr  schön  .>  Und  doch  läßt \nsich  wohl  denken,  daß  ein  Zuhörer  in  der  Nähe  wenig \nFreude  an  solchen  Stimmen  haben  möchte,  die  mit  den \nWellen  des  Meeres  kämpfen.  Menschlich  aber  und  wahr \nwird  der  Begriff  dieses  Gesanges,  lebendig  wird  die \nMelodie,  über  deren  tote  Buchstaben  wir  uns  sonst  den \nKopf  zerbrochen  haben.  Gesang  ist  es  eines  Einsamen  in \ndie  Ferne  und  Weite,  damit  ein  anderer,  Gleichgestimm- \nter, höre  und  antworte. \n\nDen  8.  Oktober. \nDen  Palast  Pisani  Moretta  besuchte  ich  wegen  eines  köst- \nlichen Bildes  von  Paul  Veronese.     Die  weibliche  Familie \ndes  Darius  kniet  vor  Alexandern  und  Hephästion:    die \nvoranknieende  Mutter  hält  den  letztern  für  den  König; \ner  lehnt  es  ab  und  deutet  auf  den  Rechten.    Man  erzählt \ndas  Märchen,  der  Künstler  sei  in  diesem  Palast  gut  auf- \ngenommen und  längere  Zeit  ehrenvoll  bewirtet  worden, \ndagegen  habe  er  das  Bild  heimlich  gemalt  und,  als  Ge- \nschenk, zusammengerollt  unter  das  Bett  geschoben.    Es \nverdient  allerdings  einen  besondern  Ursprung  zu  haben, \ndenn  es  gibt  einen  Begriff  von  dem  ganzen  Werte  des \nMeisters.     Seine  große  Kunst,   ohne  einen  allgemeinen \nTon,    der   über  das   ganze  Stück   gezogen  wäre,  durch \nkunstreich  verteiltes  Licht  und  Schatten  und  ebenso  weis- \nlich abwechselnde  Lokalfarben  die  köstlichste  Harmonie \nhervorzubringen,  ist  hier  recht  sichtbar,  da  das  Bild  voll- \nkommen erhalten  und  frisch,  wie  von  gestern    vor  uns \nsteht:  denn  freilich,  sobald  ein  Gemälde  dieser  Art  ge- \nlitten hat,  wird  unser  Genuß  sogleich  getrübt,  ohne  daß \nwir  wissen,  was  die  Ursache  sei. \n\nWer    mit  dem    Künstler   wegen   des  Kostüms   rechten \nwollte,  der  dürfte  sich  nur  sagen,  es  habe  eine  Geschichte \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  91 \n\ndes  sechzehnten  Jahrhunderts  gemalt  werden  sollen,  und \nso  ist  alles  abgetan.  Die  Abstufung  von  der  Mutter  durch \nGemahlin  und  Töchter  ist  höchst  wahr  und  glücklich;  die \njüngste  Prinzeß,  ganz  am  Ende  knieend,  ist  ein  hübsches \nMäuschen  und  hat  ein  gar  artiges,  eigensinniges,  trotziges \nGesichtchen,  ihre  Lage  scheint  ihr  gar  nicht  zu  gefallen. \n\nMeine  alte  Gabe,  die  Welt  mit  Augen  desjenigen  Malers \nzu  sehen,  dessen  Bilder  ich  mir  eben  eingedrückt,  brachte \nmich  auf  einen  eignen  Gedanken.  Es  ist  offenbar,  daß \nsich  das  Auge  nach  den  Gegenständen  bildet,  die  es  von \nJugend  auf  erblickt,  und  so  muß  der  venezianische  Maler \nalles  klarer  und  heiterer  sehn  als  andere  Menschen.  Wir, \ndie  wir  auf  einem  bald  schmutzkotigen,  bald  staubigen, \nfarblosen,  die  Widerscheine  verdüsternden  Boden,  und \nvielleicht  gar  in  engen  Gemächern  leben,  können  einen \nsolchen  Frohblick  aus  uns  selbst  nicht  entwickeln. \nAls  ich,  bei  hohem  Sonnenschein,  durch  die  Lagunen \nfuhr  und  auf  den  Gondelrändern  die  Gondoliere  leicht \nschwebend,  buntbekleidet,  rudernd  betrachtete,  wie  sie \nauf  der  hellgrünen  Fläche  sich  in  der  blauen  Luft  zeich- \nneten, so  sah  ich  das  beste,  frischeste  Bild  der  venezia- \nnischen Schule.  Der  Sonnenschein  hob  die  Lokalfarben \nblendend  hervor,  und  die  Schattenseiten  waren  so  licht, \ndaß  sie  verhältnismäßig  wieder  zu  Lichtern  hätten  dienen \nkönnen.  Ein  gleiches  galt  von  den  Widerscheinen  des \nmeergrünen  Wassers.  Alles  war  hell  in  hell  gemalt,  so \ndaß  die  schäumende  Welle  und  die  Blitzlichter  darauf \nnötig  waren,  um  die  Tüpfchen  aufs  i  zu  setzen. \nTizian  und  Paul  hatten  diese  Klarheit  im  höchsten  Grade, \nund  wo  man  sie  in  ihren  Werken  nicht  findet,  hat  das \nBild  verloren  oder  ist  aufgemalt. \n\nDie  Kuppeln  und  Gewölbe  der  Markuskirche,  nebst  ihren \nSeitenflächen,  alles  ist  bilderreich,  alles  bunte  Figuren \nauf  goldenem  Grunde,  alles  musivische  Arbeit;  einige \nsind  recht  gut,  andere  gering,  je  nachdem  die  Meister \nwaren,  die  den  Karton  verfertigten. \nEs  fiel  mir  recht  aufs  Herz,  daß  doch  alles  auf  die  erste \nErfindung  ankommt  und  daß  diese  das  rechte  Maß,  den \n\n\n92  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nwahren  Geist  habe,  da  man  mit  viereckten  Stückchen \nGlas,  und  hier  nicht  einmal  auf  die  sauberste  Weise,  das \nGute  sowohl  als  das  Schlechte  nachbilden  kann.  Die \nKunst,  welche  dem  Alten  seine  Fußboden  bereitete,  dem \nChristen  seine  Kirchenhimmel  wölbte,  hat  sich  jetzt  auf \nDosen  und  Armbänder  verkrümelt.  Diese  Zeiten  sind \nschlechter,  als  man  denkt. \n\nIn  dem  Hause  Farsetti  ist  eine  kostbare  Sammlung  von \nAbgüssen  der  besten  Antiken.  Ich  schweige  von  denen, \ndie  ich  von  Mannheim  her  und  sonst  schon  gekannt,  und \nerwähne  nur  neuere  Bekanntschaften.  Eine  Kleopatra  in \nkolossaler  Ruhe,  die  Aspis  um  den  Arm  geschlungen  und \nin  den  Tod  hinüberschlafend;  ferner  die  Mutter  Niobe, \ndie  ihre  jüngste  Tochter  mit  dem  Mantel  vor  den  Pfeilen \ndes  Apollo  deckt;  sodann  einige  Gladiatoren,  ein  in  sei- \nnen Flügeln  ruhender  Genius,  sitzende  und  stehende \nPhilosophen. \n\nEs  sind  Werke,  an  denen  sich  die  Welt  Jahrtausende \nfreuen  und  bilden  kann,  ohne  den  Wert  des  Künstlers \ndurch  Gedanken  zu  erschöpfen. \n\nViele  bedeutende  Büsten  versetzen  mich  in  die  alten \nherrlichen  Zeiten.  Nur  fühle  ich  leider,  wie  weit  ich  in \ndiesen  Kenntnissen  zurück  bin;  doch  es  wird  vorwärts \ngehen,  wenigstens  weiß  ich  den  Weg.  Palladio  hat  mir \nihn  auch  dazu,  und  zu  aller  Kunst  und  Leben  geöffnet. \nEs  klingt  das  vielleicht  ein  wenig  wunderlich,  aber  doch \nnicht  so  paradox,  als  wenn  Jakob  Böhme  bei  Erblickung \neiner  zinnernen  Schüssel  durch  Einstrahlung  Jovis  über \ndas  Universum  erleuchtet  wurde.  Auch  steht  in  dieser \nSammlung  ein  Stück  des  Gebälks  vom  Tempel  des  An- \ntonius und  der  Faustina  in  Rom.  Die  vorspringende \nGegenwart  dieses  herrlichen  Architekturgebildes  erinnerte \nmich  an  das  Kapital  des  Pantheon  in  Mannheim.  Das  ist \nfreilich  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  kauzenden,  auf  Krag- \nsteinlein übereinander  geschichteten  Heiligen  der  goti- \nschen Zierweisen,  etwas  anderes  als  unsere  Tabakspfeifen - \nSäulen,  spitze  Türmlein  und  Blumenzacken;  diese  bin  ich \nnun,  Gott  sei  Dank,  auf  ewig  los! \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  93 \n\nNoch  will  ich  einiger  Werke  der  Bildhauerkunst  erwähnen, \ndie  ich  diese  Tage  her,  zwar  nur  im  Vorbeigehen,  aber \ndoch  mit  Erstaunen  und  Erbauung  betrachtet:  zwei  un- \ngeheure Löwen,  von  weißem  Marmor,  vor  dem  Tore  des \nArsenals;  der  eine  sitzt  aufgerichtet,  auf  die  Vorder- \npfoten gestemmt,  der  andere  liegt — herrliche  Gegenbilder \nvon  lebendiger  Mannigfaltigkeit.  Sie  sind  so  groß,  daß \nsie  alles  umher  klein  machen  und  daß  man  selbst  zu- \nnichte würde,  wenn  erhabene  Gegenstände  uns  nicht  er- \nhüben. Sie  sollen  aus  der  besten  griechischen  Zeit  und \nvom  Piraeus  in  den  glänzenden  Tagen  der  Republik  hier- \nher gebracht  sein. \n\nAus  Athen  mögen  gleichfalls  ein  paar  Basreliefe  stam- \nmen, in  dem  Tempel  der  heiligen  Justina,  der  Türken- \nbesiegerin,  eingemauert,  aber  leider  durch  Kirchstühle \neinigermaßen  verfinstert.  Der  Küster  machte  mich  auf- \nmerksam darauf,  weil  die  Sage  gehe,  daß  Tizian  seine \nunendlich  schönen  Engel  im  Bilde,  die  Ermordung  des \nheiligen  Petrus  Martyr  vorstellend,  darnach  geformt  habe. \nEs  sind  Genien,  welche  sich  mit  Attributen  der  Götter \nschleppen,  freilich  so  schön,  daß  es  allen  Begriff  über- \nsteigt. \n\nSodann  betrachtete  ich  mit  ganz  eignem  Gefühl  die \nnackte  kolossale  Statue  des  Markus  Agrippa,  in  dem  Hofe \neines  Palastes;  ein  sich  ihm  zur  Seite  heraufschlängeln- \nder Delphin  deutet  auf  einen  Seehelden.  Wie  doch  eine \nsolche  heroische  Darstellung  den  reinen  Menschen  Göt- \ntern ähnlich  macht! \n\nDie  Pferde  auf  der  Markuskirche  besah  ich  in  der  Nähe. \nVon  unten  hinauf  bemerkt  man  leicht,  daß  sie  fleckig \nsind,  teils  einen  schönen  gelben  Metallglanz  haben,  teils \nkupfergrünlich  angelaufen.  In  der  Nähe  sieht  und  erfährt \nman,  daß  sie  ganz  verguldet  waren,  und  sieht  sie  über \nund  über  mit  Striemen  bedeckt,  da  die  Barbaren  das \nGold  nicht  abfeilen,  sondern  abhauen  wollten.  Auch  das \nist  gut,  so  blieb  wenigstens  die  Gestalt. \nEin  herrlicher  Zug  Pferde!  ich  möchte  einen  rechten \nPferdekenner  darüber  reden  hören.     Was  mir  sonderbar \n\n\n94  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nscheint,  ist,  daß  sie  in  der  Nähe  schwer  und  unten  vom \nPlatz  leicht  wie  die  Hirsche  aussehen. \n\nIch  fuhr  heute  früh  mit  meinem  Schutzgeiste  aufs  Lido, \nauf  die  Erdzunge,  welche  die  Lagunen  schließt  und  sie \nvom  Meere  absondert.  Wir  stiegen  aus  und  gingen  quer \nüber  die  Zunge.  Ich  hörte  ein  starkes  Geräusch:  es  war \n(las  Meer,  und  ich  sah  es  bald,  es  ging  hoch  gegen  das \nUfer,  indem  es  sich  zurückzog,  es  war  um  Mittag,  Zeit \nder  Ebbe.  So  habe  ich  denn  auch  das  Meer  mit  Augen \ngesehen  und  bin  auf  der  schönen  Tenne,  die  es  weichend \nzurückläßt,  ihm  nachgegangen.  Da  hätte  ich  mir  die \nKinder  gewünscht,  um  der  Muscheln  willen;  ich  habe, \nselbst  kindisch,  ihrer  genug  aufgelesen;  doch  widme  ich \nsie  zu  einigem  Gebrauch:  ich  möchte  von  der  Feuchtig- \nkeit des  Tintenfisches,  die  hier  so  häufig  wegfließt,  etwas \neintrocknen. \n\nAuf  dem  Lido,  nicht  weit  vom  Meer,  liegen  Engländer \nbegraben,  und  weiterhin  Juden,  die  beiderseits  in  ge- \nweihtem Boden  nicht  ruhen  sollten.  Ich  fand  das  Grab \ndes  edlen  Konsul  Smith  und  seiner  ersten  Frauen;  ich \nbin  ihm  mein  Exemplar  des  Palladio  schuldig  und  dankte \nihm  auf  seinem  ungeweihten  Grabe  dafür, \nlind  nicht  allein  ungeweiht,  sondern  halbverschüttet  ist \ndas  Grab.  Das  Lido  ist  immer  nur  wie  eine  Düne  anzu- \nsehen; der  Sand  wird  dorthin  geführt,  vom  Winde  hin \nund  her  getrieben,  aufgehäuft,  überall  angedrängt.  In \nweniger  Zeit  wird  man  das  ziemlich  erhöhte  Monument \nkaum  wiederfinden  können. \n\nDas  Meer  ist  doch  ein  großer  Anblick!  Ich  will  sehen, \nin  einem  Fischerkahn  eine  Fahrt  zu  tun:  die  Gondeln \nwagen  sich  nicht  hinaus. \n\nAm  Meere  habe  ich  auch  verschiedene  Pflanzen  gefun- \nden, deren  ähnlicher  Charakter  mir  ihre  Eigenschaften \nnäher  kennen  ließ:  sie  sind  alle  zugleich  mastig  und \nstreng,  saftig  und  zäh,  und  es  ist  offenbar,  daß  das  alte \nSalz  des  Sandbodens,  mehr  aber  die  salzige  Luft  ihnen \ndiese  Eigenschaften  gibt;    sie  strotzen  von  Säften,  wie \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  95 \n\nWasserpflanzen,  sie  sind  fest  und  zäh,  wie  Bergpflanzen; \nwenn  ihre  Blätterenden  eine  Neigung  zu  Stacheln  haben, \nwie  Disteln  tun,  sind  sie  gewaltig  spitz  und  stark.  Ich \nfand  einen  solchen  Busch  Blätter;  es  schien  mir  unser \nunschuldiger  Huflattich,  hier  aber  mit  scharfen  Wafien \nbewatihet,  und  das  Blatt  wie  Leder,  so  auch  die  Samen- \nkapseln, die  Stiele,  alles  mastig  und  fest.  Ich  bringe \nSamen  mit  und  eingelegte  Blätter  (Eryngium  mari- \ntimum). \n\nDer  Fischmarkt  und  die  unendlichen  Seeprodukte  machen \nmir  viel  Vergnügen;  ich  gehe  oft  darüber  und  beleuchte \ndie  unglücklichen  aufgehaschten  Meeresbewohner. \n\nDen  g.  Oktober. \nEin  köstlicher  Tag,  vom  Morgen  bis  in  die  Nacht!  Ich \nfuhr  bis  Palestrina  gegen  Chiozza  über,  wo  die  großen \nBaue  sind,  Murazzi  genannt,  welche  die  Republik  gegen \ndas  Meer  aufführen  läßt.  Sie  sind  von  gehauenen  Stei- \nnen und  sollen  eigentlich  die  lange  Erdzunge,  Lido  ge- \nnannt, welche  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere  trennt,  vor \ndiesem  wilden  Elemente  schützen. \n\nDie  Lagunen  sind  eine  Wirkung  der  alten  Natur.  Erst \nEbbe,  Flut  und  Erde,  gegeneinander  arbeitend,  dann \ndas  allmähliche  Sinken  des  Urgewässers  waren  Ursache, \ndaß  am  obern  Ende  des  Adriatischen  Meeres  sich  eine \nansehnliche  Sumpfstrecke  befindet,  welche  von  der  Flut \nbesucht,  von  der  Ebbe  zum  Teil  verlassen  wird.  Die \nKunst  hat  sich  der  höchsten  Stellen  bemächtigt,  und  so \nliegt  Venedig,  von  hundert  Inseln  zusammen  gruppiert \nund  von  hunderten  umgeben.  Zugleich  hat  man,  mit  un- \nglaublicher Anstrengung  und  Kosten,  tiefe  Kanäle  in  den \nSumpf  gefurcht,  damit  man  auch  zur  Zeit  der  Ebbe  mit \nKriegsschiffen  an  die  Hauptstellen  gelangen  könne.  Was \nMenschenwitz  und  Fleiß  vor  alters  ersonnen  und  ausge- \nführt, muß  Klugheit  und  Fleiß  nun  erhalten.  Das  Lido, \nein  langer  Erdstreif,  trennt  die  Lagunen  von  dem  Meere, \nwelches  nur  an  zwei  Orten  hereintreten  kann,  bei  dem \nKastell  nämlich  und  am  entgegengesetzten  Ende,  bei \nChiozza.     Die  Flut  tritt  gewöhnlich  des  Tages  zweimal \n\n\n96  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nherein,  und  die  Ebbe  bringt  das  Wasser  zweimal  hinaus, \nimmer  durch  denselben  Weg  in  denselben  Richtungen. \nDie  Flut  bedeckt  die  innern  morastigen  Stellen  und  läßt \ndie  erhühteren,  wo  nicht  trocken,  doch  sichtbar. \nGanz  anders  wäre  es,  wenn  das  Meer  sich  neue  Wege \nsuchte,  die  Erdzunge  angriffe  und  nach  Willkür  hinein \nund  heraus  flutete.  Nicht  gerechnet,  daß  die  Örtchen \nauf  dem  Lido,  Palestrina,  St.  Peter  und  andere,  unter- \ngehen müßten,  so  würden  auch  jene  Kommunikations- \nkanäle ausgefüllt  und,  indem  das  Wasser  alles  durchein- \nander schlemmte,  das  Lido  zu  Inseln,  die  Inseln,  die \njetzt  dahinterliegen,  zu  Erdzungen  verwandelt  werden. \nDieses  zu  verhüten,  müssen  sie  das  Lido  verwahren,  was \nsie  können,  damit  das  Element  nicht  dasjenige  willkür- \nlich angreifen,  hinüber  und  herüber  werfen  möge,  was \ndie  Menschen  schon  in  Besitz  genommen,  dem  sie  schon \nzu  einem  gewissen  Zweck  Gestalt  und  Richtung  gegeben \nhaben. \n\nBei  außerordentlichen  Fällen,  wenn  das  Meer  übermäßig \nwächst,  ist  es  besonders  gut,  daß  es  nur  an  zwei  Orten \nherein  darf  und  das  übrige  geschlossen  bleibt;  es  kann \nalso  doch  nicht  mit  der  größten  Gewalt  eindringen  und \nmuß  sich  in  einigen  Stunden  dem  Gesetz  der  Ebbe  unter- \nwerfen und  seine  Wut  mindern. \n\nÜbrigens  hat  Venedig  nichts  zu  besorgen:  die  Langsam- \nkeit, mit  der  das  Meer  abnimmt,  gibt  ihr  Jahrtausende \nZeit,  und  sie  werden  schon,  den  Kanälen  klug  nach- \nhelfend, sich  im  Besitz  zu  erhalten  suchen. \nWenn  sie  ihre  Stadt  nur  reinlicher  hielten,  welches  so \nnotwendig  als  leicht  ist  und  wirklich,  auf  die  Folge  von \nJahrhunderten,  von  großer  Konsequenz.  Nun  ist  zwar \nbei  großer  Strafe  verboten,  nichts  in  die  Kanäle  zu \nschütten  noch  Kehricht  hineinzuwerfen;  einem  schnell \neinfallenden  Regenguß  aber  ist's  nicht  untersagt,  allen \nden  in  die  Ecken  geschobnen  Kehricht  aufzurühren,  in \ndie  Kanäle  zu  schleppen,  ja,  was  noch  schlimmer  ist,  in \ndie  Abzüge  zu  führen,  die  nur  zum  Abfluß  des  Wassers \nbestimmt  sind,  und  sie  dergestalt  zu  verschlemmen,  daß \ndie  Hauptplätze  in  Gefahr  sind,  unter  Wasser  zu  stehen. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  97 \n\nSelbst  einige  Abzüge  auf  dem  kleinen  Markusplatze,  die, \nwie  auf  dem  großen,  gar  klug  angelegt  sind,  habe  ich \nverstopft  und  voll  Wasser  gesehen. \n\nWenn  ein  Tag  Regenwetter  einfällt,  ist  ein  unleidlicher \nKot;  alles  flucht  und  schimpft,  man  besudelt  beim  Auf- \nund  Absteigen  der  Brücken  die  Mäntel,  die  Tabarros, \nwomit  man  sich  ja  das  ganze  Jahr  schleppt,  und  da  alles \nin  Schuh  und  Strümpfen  läuft,  bespritzt  man  sich  und \nschilt;  denn  man  hat  sich  nicht  mit  gemeinem,  sondern \nbeizendem  Kot  besudelt.  Das  Wetter  wird  wieder  schön, \nund  kein  Mensch  denkt  an  Reinlichkeit.  Wie  wahr  ist  es \ngesagt:  das  Publikum  beklagt  sich  immer,  daß  es  schlecht \nbedient  sei,  und  weiß  es  nicht  anzufangen,  besser  be- \ndient zu  werden.  Hier,  wenn  der  Souverän  wollte,  könnte \nalles  gleich  getan  sein. \n\nHeute  abend  ging  ich  auf  den  Markustumi;  denn  da  ich \nneulich  die  Lagunen  in  ihrer  Herrlichkeit,  zur  Zeit  der \nFlut,  von  oben  gesehen,  wollt'  ich  sie  auch  zur  Zeit  der \nEbbe,  in  ihrer  Demut,  schauen,  und  es  ist  notwendig, \ndiese  beiden  Bilder  zu  verbinden,  wenn  man  einen  rich- \ntigen Begrift\"  haben  will.  Es  sieht  sonderbar  aus,  ringsum \nüberall  Land  erscheinen  zu  sehen,  wo  vorher  Wasser- \nspiegel war.  Die  Inseln  sind  nicht  mehr  Inseln,  nur \nhöher  bebaute  Flecke  eines  großen  graugrünlichen  Mo- \nrastes, den  schöne  Kanäle  durchschneiden.  Der  sumpfige \nTeil  ist  mit  Wasserpflanzen  bewachsen  und  muß  sich  auch \ndadurch  nach  imd  nach  erheben,  obgleich  Ebbe  und  Flut \nbeständig  daran  rupfen  und  wühlen  und  der  Vegetation \nkeine  Ruhe  lassen. \n\nIch  wende  mich  mit  meiner  Erzählung  nochmals  ans  Meer. \nDort  habe  ich  heute  die  Wirtschaft  der  Seeschnecken,  Pa- \ntellen und  Taschenkrebse  gesehen  und  mich  herzlich  dar- \nüber gefreut.  Was  ist  doch  ein  Lebendiges  für  ein  köst- \nliches, herrliches  Ding!  wie  abgemessen  zu  seinem  Zu- \nstande, wie  wahr,  wie  seiend!  Wie  viel  nützt  mir  nicht  mein \nbißchen  Studium  der  Natur,  und  wie  freue  ich  mich,  es \nfortzusetzen!  Doch  ich  will,  da  es  sich  mitteilen  läßt,  die \nFreunde  nicht  mit  bloßen  Ausrufungen  anreizen. \n\nGOETHE  IV  7 \n\n\n98  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nDie  dem  Meere  entgegengebauten  Mauerwerke  bestehen \nerst  aus  einigen  steilen  Stufen,  dann  kommt  eine  sacht \nansteigende  Fläche,  sodann  wieder  eine  Stufe,  abermals \neine  sanft  ansteigende  Fläche,  dann  eine  steile  Mauer \nmit  einem  oben  überhängenden  Kopfe.  Diese  Stufen,  diese \nFlächen  hinan  steigt  nun  das  flutende  Meer,  bis  es,  in \naußerordentlichen  Fällen,  endlich  oben  an  der  Mauer \nund  deren  Vorsprung  zerschellt. \n\nDem  Meere  folgen  seine  Bewohner,  kleine  eßbare  Schnek- \nken,  einschalige  Patellen,  und  was  sonst  noch  beweg- \nlich ist,  besonders  die  Taschenkrebse.  Kaum  aber  haben \ndiese  Tiere  an  den  glatten  Mauern  Besitz  genommen,  so \nzieht  sich  schon  das  Meer,  weichend  und  schwellend,  wie \nes  gekommen,  wieder  zurück.  Anfangs  weiß  das  Ge- \nwimmel nicht,  woran  es  ist,  und  hoftt  immer,  die  salzige \nFlut  soll  wiederkehren;  allein  sie  bleibt  aus,  die  Sonne \nsticht  und  trocknet  schnell,  und  nun  geht  der  Rückzug \nan.  Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit  suchen  die  Taschenkrebse \nihren  Raub.  Wunderlicher  und  komischer  kann  man \nnichts  sehen  als  die  Gebärden  dieser  aus  einem  runden \nKörper  und  zwei  langen  Scheren  bestehenden  Geschöpfe; \ndenn  die  übrigen  Spinnenfüße  sind  nicht  bemerklich.  Wie \nauf  stelzenartigen  Armen  schreiten  sie  einher,  und  so- \nbald eine  Patelle  sich  unter  ihrem  Schild  vom  Flecke \nbewegt,  fahren  sie  zu,  um  die  Schere  in  den  schmalen \nRaum  zwischen  der  Schale  und  dem  Boden  zu  stecken, \ndas  Dach  umzukehren  und  die  Auster  zu  verschmausen. \nDie  Patelle  zieht  sachte  ihren  Weg  hin,  saugt  sich  aber \ngleich  fest  an  den  Stein,  sobald  sie  die  Nähe  des  Feindes \nmerkt.  Dieser  gebärdet  sich  nun  wunderlich  um  das \nDächelchen  herum,  gar  zierlich  und  alienhaft;  aber  ihm \nfehlt  die  Kraft,  den  mächtigen  Muskel  des  weichen  Tier- \nchens zu  überwältigen,  er  tut  auf  diese  Beute  Verzicht, \neilt  auf  eine  andere  wandernde  los,  und  die  erste  setzt \nihren  Zug  sachte  fort.  Ich  habe  nicht  gesehen,  daß  irgend \nein  Taschenkrebs  zu  seinem  Zweck  gelangt  wäre,  ob  ich \ngleich  den  Rückzug  dieses  Gewimmels  stundenlang,  wie \nsie  die  beiden  Flächen  und  die  dazwischen  liegenden \nStufen  hinabschlichen,  beobachtet  habe. \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  99 \n\nDcti  10.  Oktober. \nNun  endlich  kann  ich  denn  auch  sagen,  daß  ich  eine  Ko- \nmödie gesehen  habe!  Sie  spielten  heut  auf  dem  Theater \nSt.  Lukas:  Le  Baruffe  Chiozzotte,  welches  allenfalls  zu \nübersetzen  wäre:  Die  Rauf-  und  Schreihändel  von  Chi- \nozza.  Die  Handelnden  sind  lauter  Seeleute,  Einwohner \nvon  Chiozza,  und  ihre  Weiber,  Schwestern  und  Töchter. \nDas  gewöhnliche  Geschrei  dieser  Leute,  im  Guten  und \nBösen,  ihre  Händel,  Heftigkeit,  Gutmütigkeit,  Plattheit, \nWitz,  Humor  und  ungezwungene  Manieren,  alles  ist  gar \nbrav  nachgeahmt.  Das  Stück  ist  noch  von  Goldoni,  und \nda  ich  erst  gestern  in  jener  Gegend  war  und  mir  Stim- \nmen und  Betragen  der  See-  und  Hafenleute  noch  im \nAug'  und  Ohr  widerschien  und  widerklang,  so  machte \nes  gar  große  Freude,  und  ob  ich  gleich  manchen  einzel- \nnen Bezug  nicht  verstand,  so  konnte  ich  doch  dem  Gan- \nzen recht  gut  folgen.  Der  Plan  des  Stücks  ist  folgender. \nDie  Einwohnerinnen  von  Chiozza  sitzen  auf  der  Reede \nvor  ihren  Häusern,  spinnen,  stricken,  nähen,  klippein, \nwie  gewöhnlich;  ein  junger  Mensch  geht  vorüber  und \ngrüßt  eine  freundlicher  als  die  übrigen;  sogleich  fängt \ndas  Sticheln  an;  dies  hält  nicht  Maße,  es  schärft  sich  und \nwächst  bis  zum  Hohne,  steigert  sich  zu  Vorwürfen,  eine \nUnart  überbietet  die  andere;  eine  heftige  Nachbarin  platzt \nmit  der  Wahrheit  heraus,  und  nun  ist  Schelten,  Schimp- \nfen, Schreien  auf  einmal  losgebunden,  es  fehlt  nicht  an \nentschiedenen  Beleidigungen,  so  daß  die  Gerichtspersonen \nsich  einzumischen  genötigt  sind. \n\nIm  zweiten  Akt  befindet  man  sich  in  der  Gerichtsstube. \nDer  Aktuarius  an  der  Stelle  des  abwesenden  Podesta,  der \nals  Nobile  nicht  auf  dem  Theater  hätte  erscheinen  dürfen, \nder  Aktuarius  also  läßt  die  Frauen  einzeln  vorfordern: \ndieses  wird  dadurch  bedenklich,  daß  er  selbst  in  die  erste \nLiebhaberin  verliebt  ist  und,  sehr  glücklich  sie  allein  zu \nsprechen,  anstatt  sie  zu  verhören  ihr  eine  Liebeserklärung \ntut.  Eine  andere,  die  in  den  Aktuarius  verliebt  ist,  stürzt \neifersüchtig  herein,  der  aufgeregte  Liebhaber  der  ersten \ngleichfalls,   die   übrigen   folgen,   neue   Vorwürfe  häufen \n\n\nloo  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nsich,  und  nun  ist  der  Teufel  in  der  Gerichtsstube  los,  wie \nvorher  auf  dem  Hafenplatz. \n\nIm  dritten  Akt  steigert  sich  der  Scherz,  und  das  Ganze \nendet  mit  einer  eiligen  notdürftigen  Auflösung.  Der  glück- \nlichste Gedanke  jedoch  ist  in  einem  Charakter  ausge- \ndrückt, der  sich  folgendermaßen  darstellt. \nEin  alter  Schiffer,  dessen  Gliedmaßen,  besonders  aber \ndie  Sprachorgane,  durch  eine  von  Jugend  auf  geführte \nharte  Lebensart  stockend  geworden,  tritt  auf,  als  Gegen- \nsatz des  beweglichen,  schwätzenden,  schreiseligen  Volkes; \ner  nimmt  immer  erst  einen  Anlauf  durch  Bewegung  der \nLippen  und  Nachhelfen  der  Hände  und  Arme,  bis  er \ndenn  endlich,  was  er  gedacht,  herausstößt.  Weil  ihm \ndieses  aber  nur  in  kurzen  Sätzen  gelingt,  so  hat  er  sich \neinen  lakonischen  Ernst  angewöhnt,  dergestalt,  daß  alles, \nwas  er  sagt,  sprüchwörtlich  oder  sentenzios  klingt,  wo- \ndurch denn  das  übrige  wilde,  leidenschaftliche  Handeln \ngar  schön  ins  Gleichgewicht  gesetzt  wird. \nAber  auch  so  eine  Lust  habe  ich  noch  nie  erlebt,  als  das \nVolk  laut  werden  ließ,  sich  und  die  Seinigen  so  natürlich \nvorstellen  zu  sehen.  Ein  Gelächter  und  Gejauchze  von \nAnfang  bis  zu  Ende.  Ich  muß  aber  auch  gestehen,  daß \ndie  Schauspieler  es  vortrefflich  machten.  Sie  hatten  sich, \nnach  Anlage  der  Charaktere,  in  die  verschiedenen  Stim- \nmen geteilt,  welche  unter  dem  Volk  gewöhnlich  vorkom- \nmen. Die  erste  Aktrice  war  allerliebst,  viel  besser  als  neu- \nlich in  Heldentracht  und  Leidenschaft.  Die  Frauen  über- \nhaupt, besonders  aber  diese,  ahmten  Stimme,  Gebärden \nund  Wesen  des  Volks  aufs  anmutigste  nach.  Großes  Lob \nverdient  der  Verfasser,  der  aus  nichts  den  angenehmsten \nZeitvertreib  gel)ildet  hat.  Das  kann  man  aber  auch  nur \nunmittelbar  seinem  eignen  lebenslustigen  Volk.  Es  ist \ndurchaus  mit  einer  geübten  Hand  geschrieben. \nVon  der  Truppe  Sacchi,  für  welche  Gozzi  arbeitete  und \ndie  übrigens  zerstreut  ist,  habe  ich  die  Smeraldina  ge- \nsehen, eine  kleine,  dicke  Figur,  voller  Leben,  Gewandt- \nheit und  guten  Humors.  Mit  ihr  sah  ich  den  }3righella, \neinen  hagem,  wohlgebauten,  besonders  in  Mienen-  und \nHändespiel  trefilichen  Schauspieler.    Diese  Masken,  die \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  loi \n\nwir  fast  nur  als  Mumien  kennen,  da  sie  für  uns  weder \nLeben  noch  Bedeutung  haben,  tun  hier  gar  zu  wohl,  als \nGeschöpfe  dieser  Landschaft.  Die  ausgezeichneten  Alter, \nCharaktere  und  Stände  haben  sich  in  wunderlichen  Klei- \ndern verkörpert,  und  wenn  man  selbst  den  größten  Teil \ndes  Jahrs  mit  der  Maske  herumläuft,  so  findet  man  nichts \nnatürlicher,  als  daß  da  droben  auch  schwarze  Gesichter \nerscheinen. \n\nDen  II.  Oktober. \n\nUnd  weil  die  Einsamkeit  in  einer  so  großen  Menschen- \nmasse denn  doch  zuletzt  nicht  recht  möglich  sein  will, \nso  bin  ich  mit  einem  alten  Franzosen  zusammengekom- \nmen, der  kein  Italienisch  kann,  sich  wie  verraten  und \nverkauft  fühlt  und,  mit  allen  Empfehlungsschreiben,  doch \nnicht  recht  weiß,  woran  er  ist.  Ein  Mann  von  Stande, \nsehr  guter  Lebensart,  der  aber  nicht  aus  sich  heraus  kann; \ner  mag  stark  in  den  Funfzigen  sein  und  hat  zu  Hause  einen \nsiebenjährigen  Knaben,  von  dem  er  bänglich  Nachrichten \nerwartet.  Ich  habe  ihm  einige  Gefälligkeiten  erzeigt;  er \nreist  durch  Italien  bequem,  aber  geschwind,  um  es  doch \neinmal  gesehen  zu  haben,  und  mag  sich  gern  im  Vorbei- \ngehen so  viel  wie  möglich  unterrichten;  ich  gebe  ihm \nAuskunft  über  manches.  Als  ich  mit  ihm  von  Venedig \nsprach,  fragte  er  mich,  wie  lange  ich  hier  sei,  und  als  er \nhörte,  nur  vierzehn  Tage  und  zum  erstenmal,  versetzte \ner:  II  parait  que  vous  n'avez  pas  perdu  votre  temps.  Das \nist  das  erste  Testimonium  meines  Wohlverhaltens,  das \nich  aufweisen  kann.  Er  ist  nun  acht  Tage  hier  und \ngeht  morgen  fort.  Es  war  mir  köstlich,  einen  recht  ein- \ngefleischten Versailler  in  der  Fremde  zu  sehen.  Der \nreist  nun  auch!  und  ich  betrachtete  mit  Erstaunen,  wie \nman  reisen  kann,  ohne  etwas  außer  sich  gewahr  zu  wer- \nden; und  er  ist  in  seiner  Art  ein  recht  gebildeter,  wackrer, \nordentlicher  Mann. \n\nDen  12.  Oktober. \nGestern  gaben  sie  zu  St.  Lukas  ein  neues  Stück:  LTngli- \ncismo  in  Italia.    Da  viele  Engländer  in  Italien  leben,  so \n\n\nI02  ITALIENISCHE  REISE  I \n\nist  es  natürlich,  daß  ihre  Sitten  bemerkt  werden,  und \nich  dachte  hier  zu  erfahren,  wie  die  ItaHener  diese  rei- \nchen und  ihnen  so  willkommenen  Gäste  betrachten;  aber \nes  war  ganz  und  gar  nichts.  Einige  glückliche  Narren- \nszenen, wie  immer,  das  übrige  aber  zu  schwer  und  ernst- \nlich gemeint,  und  denn  doch  keine  Spur  von  englischem \nSinn;  die  gewöhnlichen  italienischen  sittlichen  Gemein- \nsprüche, und  auch  nur  auf  das  Gemeinste  gerichtet. \nAuch  gefiel  es  nicht  und  war  auf  dem  Punkt,  ausgepfiffen \nzu  werden;  die  Schauspieler  fühlten  sich  nicht  in  ihrem \nElemente,  nicht  auf  dem  Platze  von  Chiozza.  Da  dies \ndas  letzte  Stück  ist,  was  ich  hier  sehe,  so  scheint  es,  mein \nEnthusiasmus  für  jene  Nationalrepräsentation  sollte  noch \ndurch  diese  Folie  erhöht  werden. \n\nNachdem  ich  zum  Schluß  mein  Tagebuch  durchgegangen, \nkleine  Schreibtafelbemerkungen  eingeschaltet,  so  sollen \ndie  Akten  inrotuliert  und  den  Freunden  zum  Urteils- \nspruch zugeschickt  werden.  Schon  jetzt  finde  ich  man- \nches in  diesen  Blättern,  das  ich  näher  bestimmen,  er- \nweitern und  verbessern  könnte;  es  mag  stehen  als  Denk- \nmal des  ersten  Eindrucks,  der,  wenn  er  auch  nicht  immer \nwahr  wäre,  uns  doch  köstlich  und  wert  bleibt.  Könnte \nich  nur  den  Freunden  einen  Hauch  dieser  leichtern  Exi- \nstenz hinübersenden!  Jawohl  ist  dem  Italiener  das  Ultra- \nmontane eine  dunkle  Vorstellung,  auch  mir  kommt  das \nJenseits  der  Alpen  nun  düster  vor;  doch  winken  freund- \nliche Gestalten  immer  aus  dem  Nebel.  Nur  das  Klima \nwürde  mich  reizen,  diese  Gegenden  jenen  vorzuziehen; \ndenn  Geburt  und  Gewohnheit  sind  mächtige  Fesseln.  Ich \nmöchte  hier  nicht  leben,  wie  überall  an  keinem  Orte,  wo  ich \nunbeschäftigt  wäre;  jetzt  macht  mir  das  Neue  unendlich \nviel  zu  Schäften.  Die  Baukunst  steigt  wie  ein  alter  Geist \naus  dem  Grabe  hervor,  sie  heißt  mich  ihre  Lehren,  wie \ndie  Regeln  einer  ausgestorbenen  Sprache,  studieren, \nnicht  um  sie  auszuüben  oder  mich  in  ihr  lebendig  zu \nerfreuen,  sondern  nur  um  die  ehrwürdige,  für  ewig  ab- \ngeschiedene Existenz  der  vergangenen  Zeitalter  in  einem \nstillen  Gemüte  zu  verehren.    Da  Palladio  alles  auf  Vitruv \n\n\nVENEDIG  1786  103 \n\nbezieht,  so  habe  ich  mir  auch  die  Ausgabe  des  Galiani \nangeschaftt:  allein  dieser  Foliante  lastet  in  meinem  Ge- \npäck wie  das  Studium  desselben  auf  meinem  Gehirn. \nPalladio  hat  mir  durch  seine  Worte  und  Werke,  durch \nseine  Art  und  Weise  des  Denkens  und  Schaffens  den \nVitruv  schon  näher  gebracht  und  verdolmetscht,  besser \nals  die  italienische  Übersetzung  tun  kann.  Vitruv  liest \nsich  nicht  so  leicht;  das  Buch  ist  an  sich  schon  düster \ngeschrieben  und  fordert  ein  kritisches  Studium.  Dem- \nohngeachtet  lese  ich  es  flüchtig  durch,  und  es  bleibt  mir \nmancher  würdige  Eindruck.  Besser  zu  sagen:  ich  lese \nes  wie  ein  Brevier,  mehr  aus  Andacht  als  zur  Belehrung. \nSchon  bricht  die  Nacht  zeitiger  ein  und  gibt  Raum  zum \nLesen  imd  Schreiben. \n\nGott  sei  Dank,  wie  mir  alles  wieder  lieb  wird,  was  mir \nvon  Jugend  auf  wert  war!  Wie  glücklich  befinde  ich  mich, \ndaß  ich  den  alten  Schriftstellern  wieder  näher  zu  treten \nwage!  Denn  jetzt  darf  ich  es  sagen,  darf  meine  Krank- \nheit und  Torheit  bekennen.  Schon  einige  Jahre  her  dürft' \nich  keinen  lateinischen  Autor  ansehen,  nichts  betrachten, \nwas  mir  ein  Bild  Italiens  erneute.  Geschah  es  zufällig, \nso  erduldete  ich  die  entsetzlichsten  Schmerzen.  Herder \nspottete  oft  über  mich,  daß  ich  all  mein  Latein  aus  dem \nSpinoza  lerne;  denn  er  hatte  bemerkt,  daß  dies  das  einzige \nlateinische  Buch  war,  das  ich  las:  er  wußte  aber  nicht,  wie \nsehr  ich  mich  vor  den  Alten  hüten  mußte,  wie  ich  mich  in \njene  abstrusen  Allgemeinheiten  nur  ängstlich  flüchtete. \nNoch  zuletzt  hat  mich  die  Wielandsche  Übersetzung  der \nSatiren  höchst  unglücklich  gemacht:  ich  hatte  kaum  zwei \ngelesen,  so  war  ich  schon  verrückt. \nHätte  ich  nicht  den  Entschluß  gefaßt,  den  ich  jetzt  aus- \nführe, so  war'  ich  rein  zugrunde  gegangen:  zu  einer  sol- \nchen Reife  war  die  Begierde,  diese  Gegenstände  mit \nAugen  zu  sehen,  in  meinem  Gemüt  gestiegen.  Die  histo- \nrische Kenntnis  fördert  mich  nicht:  die  Dinge  standen \nnur  eine  Handbreit  von  mir  ab,  aber  durch  eine  undurch- \ndringliche Mauer  geschieden.

Oktober,  2  Stundeti  in  der  Nacht. \nIn  den  letzten  Augenblicken  meines  Hierseins:  denn  es \ngeht  sogleich  mit  dem  Kurierschifte  nach  Ferrara.  Ich \nverlasse  Venedig  gern;  denn  um  mit  Vergnügen  und \nNutzen  zu  bleiben,  müßte  ich  andere  Schritte  tun,  die \naußer  meinem  Plan  liegen;  auch  verläßt  jedermann  nun \ndiese  Stadt  und  sucht  seine  Garten  und  Besitzungen \nauf  dem  festen  Lande.  Ich  habe  indes  gut  aufgeladen \nund  trage  das  reiche,  sonderbare,  einzige  Bild  mit  mir \nfort. \n\n\n--- [ID: e903f4eb-27d0-4022-9799-beb412688474] GOETHES_Excerpt ---\n[HOW TO USE]: Here is the excerpt text that must be augmented\nDen 3. Oktober. Die Kirche Il Redentore, ein schönes, großes Werk von Palladio, die Fassade lobenswürdiger als die von St. Giorgio. Diese mehrmals in Kupfer gestochenen Werke müßte man vor sich sehen, um das Gesagte verdeutlichen zu können. Hier nur wenige Worte. Palladio war durchaus von der Existenz der Alten durchdrungen und fühlte die Kleinheit und Enge seiner Zeit wie ein großer Mensch, der sich nicht hingeben, sondern das übrige soviel als möglich nach seinen edlen Begriffen umbilden will. Er war unzufrieden, wie ich aus gelinder Wendung seines Buches schließe, daß man bei christlichen Kirchen nach der Form der alten Basiliken zu bauen fortfahre, er suchte deshalb seine heiligen Gebäude der alten Tempelform zu nähern; daher entstanden gewisse Unschicklichkeiten, die mir bei Il Redentore glücklich beseitigt, bei St. Giorgio aber zu auffallend erscheinen. Volkmann sagt etwas davon, trifft aber den Nagel nicht auf den Kopf. Inwendig ist Il Redentore gleichfalls köstlich, alles, auch die Zeichnung der Altäre, von Palladio; leider die Nischen, die mit Statuen ausgefüllt werden sollten, prangen mit flachen, ausgeschnittenen, gemalten Brettfiguren.   Den 3. Oktober. Dem heiligen Franziskus zu Ehren hatten die Patres Capucini einen Seitenaltar mächtig ausgeputzt; man sah nichts von Stein als die korinthischen Kapitäle; alles übrige schien mit einer geschmackvollen prächtigen Stickerei nach Art der Arabesken überzogen, und zwar so artig, als man nur etwas zu sehen wünschte. Besonders wunderte ich mich über die breiten, goldgestickten Ranken und Laubwerke. Ich ging näher und fand einen recht hübschen Betrug. Alles, was ich für Gold gehalten hatte, war breitgedrücktes Stroh, nach schönen Zeichnungen auf Papier geklebt, der Grund mit lebhaften Farben angestrichen, und das so mannigfaltig und geschmackvoll, daß dieser Spaß, dessen Material gar nichts wert war, und der wahrscheinlich im Kloster selbst ausgeführt wurde, mehrere tausend Taler müßte gekostet haben, wenn er echt hätte sein sollen. Man könnte es gelegentlich wohl nachahmen. Auf einem Uferdamme im Angesicht des Wassers bemerkte ich schon einigemal einen geringen Kerl, welcher einer größern oder kleinern Anzahl von Zuhörern im venezianischen Dialekt Geschichten erzählte; ich kann leider nichts davon verstehen, es lacht aber kein Mensch, nur selten lächelt das Auditorium, das meist aus der ganz niedern Klasse besteht. Auch hat der Mann nichts Auffallendes noch Lächerliches in seiner Art, vielmehr etwas sehr Gesetztes, zugleich eine bewunderungswürdige Mannigfaltigkeit und Präzision, welche auf Kunst und Nachdenken hinwiesen, in seinen Gebärden.   Den 3. Oktober. Den Plan in der Hand suchte ich mich durch die wunderlichsten Irrgänge bis zur Kirche der Mendicanti zu finden. Hier ist das Konservatorium, welches gegenwärtig den meisten Beifall hat. Die Frauenzimmer führten ein Oratorium hinter dem Gitter auf, die Kirche war voll Zuhörer, die Musik sehr schön, und herrliche Stimmen. Ein Alt sang den König Saul, die Hauptperson des Gedichtes. Von einer solchen Stimme hatte ich gar keinen Begriff; einige Stellen der Musik waren unendlich schön, der Text vollkommen singbar, so italienisch Latein, daß man an manchen Stellen lachen muß; die Musik aber findet hier ein weites Feld. Es wäre ein trefflicher Genuß gewesen, wenn nicht der vermaledeite Kapellmeister den Takt mit einer Rolle Noten wider das Gitter und so unverschämt geklappt hätte, als habe er mit Schuljungen zu tun, die er eben unterrichtete; und die Mädchen hatten das Stück oft wiederholt, sein Klatschen war ganz unnötig und zerstörte allen Eindruck, nicht anders als wenn einer, um uns eine schöne Statue begreiflich zu machen, ihr Scharlachläppchen auf die Gelenke klebte. Der fremde Schall hebt alle Harmonie auf. Das ist nun ein Musiker, und er hört es nicht, oder er will vielmehr, daß man seine Gegenwart durch eine Unschicklichkeit vernehmen soll, da es besser wäre, er ließe seinen Wert an der Vollkommenheit der Ausführung erraten. Ich weiß, die Franzosen haben es an der Art, den Italienern hätte ich es nicht zugetraut, und das Publikum scheint daran gewöhnt. Es ist nicht das einzige Mal, daß es sich einbilden läßt, das gerade gehöre zum Genuß, was den Genuß verdirbt.\n========================\n\n=== INSTRUCTIONS ===\nCreate a 3 pages story that enhance the event :[GOETHES_Excerpt], keep everything already present and build around it.
